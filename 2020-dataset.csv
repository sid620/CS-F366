Accordingly, resistive switching materials (RSMs) based on different physical principles have emerged for memories that could enable energy-efficient and area-efficient in-memory computing. In this Review, we survey the four physical mechanisms that lead to such resistive switching: redox reactions, phase transitions, spin-polarized tunnelling and ferroelectric polarization. We discuss how these mechanisms equip RSMs with desirable properties for representation capability, switching speed and energy, reliability and device density. These properties are the key enablers of processing-in-memory platforms, with applications ranging from neuromorphic computing and general-purpose memcomputing to cybersecurity. Finally, we examine the device requirements for such systems based on RSMs and provide suggestions to address challenges in materials engineering, device optimization, system integration and algorithm design. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078056278

Deep learning is an advanced branch of machine learning, composed of multiple layers of neurons that represent the learning process. Deep learning can cope with large-scale data and has shown success in different fields. Therefore, researchers have paid more attention to investigating deep learning for intrusion detection. This survey comprehensively reviews and compares the key previous deep learning-focused cybersecurity surveys. Through an extensive review, this survey provides a novel fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based IDSs with respect to different facets, including input data, detection, deployment, and evaluation strategies. Each facet is further classified according to different criteria. This survey also compares and discusses the related experimental solutions proposed as deep learning-based IDSs. By analysing the experimental studies, this survey discusses the role of deep learning in intrusion detection, the impact of intrusion detection datasets, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The findings demonstrate that further effort is required to improve the current state-of-the art. Finally, open research challenges are identified, and future research directions for deep learning-based IDSs are recommended. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074463619

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socioeconomic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a largescale, multicountry study (N=5995) to measure public support for the digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. Results: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate uptake and found that concerns about cybersecurity and privacy, together with a lack of trust in the government, are the main barriers to adoption. Conclusions: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19. © Samuel Altmann, Luke Milsom, Hannah Zillessen, Raffaele Blasone, Frederic Gerdon, Ruben Bach, Frauke Kreuter, Daniele Nosenzo, Séverine Toussaert, Johannes Abeler.

IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment.

It finds that while the roots of this literature can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s, most of it has been published from 2010 onwards. The following aggregate conclusions are extracted from the literature: renewable energy has many advantages over fossil fuels for international security and peace; however, renewable energy is thought to exacerbate security risks and geopolitical tensions related to critical materials and cybersecurity; former hydrocarbon exporters will likely be the greatest losers from the energy transition. Many of the reviewed publications share some weaknesses: a failure to define “geopolitics”; an unwarranted assumption that very little has been published in the field previously; limited use of established forecasting, scenario-building or foresight methodologies; a lack of recognition of the complexity of the field; a lack of theorisation. Most authors do not distinguish between the geopolitical risks associated with different types of renewable energy, and only a few distinguish clearly between the geopolitics of the transitional phase and the geopolitics of a post-energy transition world. A disproportionately large part of the literature is dedicated to critical materials and cybersecurity, while only a small part concerns the decline of former fossil fuel powers. Among those publications that do discuss the decline of fossil fuels, there is also an over-focus on oil producers and a lack of attention to the countries that rely heavily on coal, for example Australia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Poland and the United States. © 2019 The Authors",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077519585

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have lately proven their effectiveness in malware binary detection through image classification. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier to detect variants of malware families and improve malware detection using CNN-based deep learning architecture, called IMCFN (Image-based Malware Classification using Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network Architecture). Differing from existing solutions, we propose a new method for multiclass classification problems. Our proposed method converts the raw malware binaries into color images that are used by the fine-tuned CNN architecture to detect and identify malware families. Our method previously trained with the ImageNet dataset (≥10 million) and utilized the data augmentation to handle the imbalance dataset during the fine-tuning process. For evaluations, an extensive experiment was conducted using 2 datasets: Malimg malware dataset (9,435 samples), and IoT- android mobile dataset (14,733 malware and 2,486 benign samples). Empirical evidence has shown that the IMCFN stands out among the deep learning models including other CNN models with an accuracy of 98.82% in Malimg malware dataset and more than 97.35% for IoT-android mobile dataset. Furthermore, it demonstrates that colored malware dataset performed better in terms of accuracy than grayscale malware images. We compared the performance of IMCFN with the three architectures VGG16, ResNet50 and Google's InceptionV3. We found that our method can effectively detect hidden code, obfuscated malware and malware family variants with little run-time. Our method is resilient to straight forward obfuscation technique commonly used by hackers to disguise malware such as encryption and packing. © 2020",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079868859

There is a very real risk that today's vehicles are subjected to cyber-attacks that target vehicular communications.

The sensing layer is made up of vehicle dynamics and environmental sensors, which are vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. The communication layer is comprised of both in-vehicle and V2X communications and is susceptible to eavesdropping, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and sybil attacks. At the top of the hierarchy is the control layer, which enables autonomous vehicular functionality, including the automation of a vehicle's speed, braking, and steering. Attacks targeting the sensing and communication layers can propagate upward and affect the functionality and can compromise the security of the control layer.

Regarding WTP for specific well-being features, attitude was the strongest positive predictor of telemedical and home security features, and social norms are the strongest positive predictor of elderly assistance and job search. Technology anxiety, surprisingly, positively influences WTP for the well-being features. Trust in utilities is not related to adoption intention, but is positively associated with WTP for the well-being features. Although cybersecurity concerns are positively associated with HEMS adoption intention for energy and well-being features, this relationship is not significant in WTP. Residents who had moderate perceived risk of getting COVID-19 are willing to pay more than the high- and low-risk groups. This paper addresses the interactions among technology attributes -, and users’ social-psychological and demographics factors. Additionally, this study provides insights for further research in examining technology adoption and energy dynamics during times of crises, such as the COVID-19. © 2020",Short Survey,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088089120

Thus, this protection becomes crucial with a typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) setup, as it usually involves several IoT-based data sources interacting with the physical world within various application domains, such as agriculture, health care, home automation, critical industrial processes, etc. Unfortunately, contemporary IoT devices often offer very limited security features, laying themselves open to always new and more sophisticated attacks and also inhibiting the expected global adoption of IoT technologies, not to mention millions of IoT devices already deployed without any hardware security support. In this context, it is crucial to develop tools able to detect such cyber threats. In this article, we present Passban, an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) able to protect the IoT devices that are directly connected to it. The peculiarity of the proposed solution is that it can be deployed directly on very cheap IoT gateways (e.g., single-board PCs currently costing few tens of U.S. dollars), hence taking full advantage of the edge computing paradigm to detect cyber threats as close as possible to the corresponding data sources. We will demonstrate that Passban is able to detect various types of malicious traffic, including Port Scanning, HTTP and SSH Brute Force, and SYN Flood attacks with very low false positive rates and satisfactory accuracies. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085562685

In this context, traditional analytical tools are facing severe challenges to detect and mitigate these threats. In this work, we introduce a novel statistical analysis and autoencoder (AE) driven intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS). Specifically, the proposed IDS combines data analytics and statistical techniques with recent advances in machine learning theory to extract more optimized, strongly correlated features. The proposed IDS is evaluated using the benchmark NSL-KDD database.

In the case of blockchain, such characteristics are provided through public-key cryptography and hash functions. However, the fast progress of quantum computing has opened the possibility of performing attacks based on Grover's and Shor's algorithms in the near future. Such algorithms threaten both public-key cryptography and hash functions, forcing to redesign blockchains to make use of cryptosystems that withstand quantum attacks, thus creating which are known as post-quantum, quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For such a purpose, this article first studies current state of the art on post-quantum cryptosystems and how they can be applied to blockchains and DLTs. Moreover, the most relevant post-quantum blockchain systems are studied, as well as their main challenges.

Despite the challenges, the health-care system and patients have been both creative and resilient in finding robust “temporary” solutions to these challenges. It is not clear if some of these COVID-era transitional steps will be preserved in the future of medical education and telemedicine. Objectives: The goal of this commentary is to address the sometimes substantial changes in medical education, continuing medical education (CME) activities, residency and fellowship programs, specialty society meetings, and telemedicine, and to consider the value of some of these profound shifts to “business as usual” in the health-care sector. Methods: This is a commentary is based on the limited available literature, online information, and the front-line experiences of the authors. Results: COVID-19 has clearly changed residency and fellowship programs by limiting the amount of hands-on time physicians could spend with patients. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medicine Education has endorsed certain policy changes to promote greater flexibility in programs but still rigorously upholds specific standards. Technological interventions such as telemedicine visits with patients, virtual meetings with colleagues, and online interviews have been introduced, and many trainees are “technoomnivores” who are comfortable using a variety of technology platforms and techniques. Webinars and e-learning are gaining traction now, and their use, practicality, and cost-effectiveness may make them important in the post-COVID era. CME activities have migrated increasingly to virtual events and online programs, a trend that may also continue due to its practicality and cost-effectiveness. While many medical meetings of specialty societies have been postponed or cancelled altogether, technology allows for virtual meetings that may offer versatility and time-saving opportunities for busy clinicians. It may be that future medical meetings embrace a hybrid approach of blending digital with face-toface experience. Telemedicine was already in place prior to the COVID-19 crisis but barriers are rapidly coming down to its widespread use and patients seem to embrace this, even as health-care systems navigate the complicated issues of cybersecurity and patient privacy. Regulatory guidance may be needed to develop safe, secure, and patient-friendly telehealth applications. Telemedicine has affected the prescribing of controlled substances in which online counseling, informed consent, and follow-up must be done in a virtual setting. For example, pill counts can be done in a video call and patients can still get questions answered about their pain therapy, although it is likely that after the crisis, prescribing controlled substances may revert to face-to-face visits. Limitations: The health-care system finds itself in a very fluid situation at the time this was written and changes are still occurring and being assessed. Conclusions: Many of the technological changes imposed so abruptly on the health-care system by the COVID-19 pandemic may be positive and it may be beneficial that some of these transitions be preserved or modified as we move forward. Clinicians must be objective in assessing these changes and retaining those changes that clearly improve health-care education and patient care as we enter the COVID era. © 2020, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

We are facing a reality with the proliferation of persistent, advanced, intelligent attacks while defenders are often way behind attackers in taking appropriate actions to thwart potential attackers. The concept of moving target defense (MTD) has emerged as a proactive defense mechanism aiming to prevent attacks. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive, in-depth survey to discuss the following aspects of MTD: key roles, design principles, classifications, common attacks, key methodologies, important algorithms, metrics, evaluation methods, and application domains. We discuss the pros and cons of all aspects of MTD surveyed in this work. Lastly, we highlight insights and lessons learned from this study and suggest future work directions.

Then we train and evaluate four key deep learning models - feed-forward neural network, autoencoder, deep belief network and long short-term memory network - for the intrusion classification task on two legacy datasets (KDD 99, NSL-KDD) and two modern datasets (CIC-IDS2017, CIC-IDS2018).

Among these challenges are the constantly changing nature of cyber systems caused by technical advances, their distribution across the physical, information, and sociocognitive domains, and the complex network structures often including thousands of nodes. Here, we review probabilistic and risk-based decision-making techniques applied to cyber systems and conclude that existing approaches typically do not address all components of the risk assessment triplet (threat, vulnerability, consequence) and lack the ability to integrate across multiple domains of cyber systems to provide guidance for enhancing cybersecurity. We present a decision-analysis-based approach that quantifies threat, vulnerability, and consequences through a set of criteria designed to assess the overall utility of cybersecurity management alternatives. The proposed framework bridges the gap between risk assessment and risk management, allowing an analyst to ensure a structured and transparent process of selecting risk management alternatives. The use of this technique is illustrated for a hypothetical, but realistic, case study exemplifying the process of evaluating and ranking five cybersecurity enhancement strategies.

The booming of the open-source software community has made vast amounts of software code available, which allows machine learning and data mining techniques to exploit abundant patterns within software code. Particularly, the recent breakthrough application of deep learning to speech recognition and machine translation has demonstrated the great potential of neural models' capability of understanding natural languages. This has motivated researchers in the software engineering and cybersecurity communities to apply deep learning for learning and understanding vulnerable code patterns and semantics indicative of the characteristics of vulnerable code. In this survey, we review the current literature adopting deep-learning-/neural-network-based approaches for detecting software vulnerabilities, aiming at investigating how the state-of-the-art research leverages neural techniques for learning and understanding code semantics to facilitate vulnerability discovery.

ICSs are often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as nuclear and thermal plants, water treatment facilities, power generation, heavy industries, and distribution systems. Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security.

Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, can be used for building such a data-driven intelligent intrusion detection system. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection Tree (""IntruDTree"") machine-learning-based security model that first takes into account the ranking of security features according to their importance and then build a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model based on the selected important features. This model is not only effective in terms of prediction accuracy for unseen test cases but also minimizes the computational complexity of the model by reducing the feature dimensions. Finally, the effectiveness of our IntruDTree model was examined by conducting experiments on cybersecurity datasets and computing the precision, recall, fscore, accuracy, and ROC values to evaluate.

Traditionally in UAV communication links, meshed ad hoc networks were among the first options of connectivity. However, the increased demand for deploying multi-UAV networks necessitates the development of a more robust and more secure networking infrastructure. In this regard, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has proved to be the better alternative for multi-UAV communication since it can offer flexible services for management and control owing to its unique features such as decoupling control from UAVs and network programmability. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of drone applications in SDN-enabled Drone Base Stations (DBS), surveillance monitoring and emergency networks, and review the performance assessment techniques and the associated cybersecurity aspects in these applications. Moreover, future research directions, after a thorough analysis of the literature, is presented in this paper. Through the development of an innovative and multifaceted drone performance-assessment framework with the primal concerns, that are meeting user-defined requirements and the provision of secure and reliable services, it is, therefore, necessary to advance in IoT-enabled spaces.

Nowadays, in the information communication technology (ICT) era, the intrusion detection (ID) system has the great potential to be the frontier of security against cyberattacks and plays a vital role in achieving network infrastructure and resources. Conventional ID systems are not strong enough to detect advanced malicious threats. Heterogeneity is one of the important features of big data. Thus, designing an efficient ID system using a heterogeneous dataset is a massive research problem. There are several ID datasets openly existing for more research by the cybersecurity researcher community. However, no existing research has shown a detailed performance evaluation of several ML methods on various publicly available ID datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malicious attacks with continuously changing attack detection methods, ID datasets are available publicly and are updated systematically. In this research, spark MLlib (machine learning library)-based robust classical ML classifiers for anomaly detection and state of the art DL, such as the convolutional-auto encoder (Conv-AE) for misuse attack, is used to develop an efficient and intelligent ID system to detect and classify unpredictable malicious attacks. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed ID system, we have used several important performance metrics, such as FAR, DR, and accuracy, while experiments are conducted on the publicly existing dataset, specifically the contemporary heterogeneous CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate cyber risk management in supply chain contexts. Design/methodology/approach: Adapting a systematic literature review process, papers from interdisciplinary areas published between 1990 and 2017 were selected. Different typologies, developed for conducting descriptive and thematic analysis, were established using data mining techniques to conduct a comprehensive, replicable and transparent review. Findings: The review identifies multiple future research directions for cyber security/resilience in supply chains. A conceptual model is developed, which indicates a strong link between information technology, organisational and supply chain security systems. The human/behavioural elements within cyber security risk are found to be critical; however, behavioural risks have attracted less attention because of a perceived bias towards technical (data, application and network) risks. There is a need for raising risk awareness, standardised policies, collaborative strategies and empirical models for creating supply chain cyber-resilience. Research limitations/implications: Different types of cyber risks and their points of penetration, propagation levels, consequences and mitigation measures are identified. The conceptual model developed in this study drives an agenda for future research on supply chain cyber security/resilience. Practical implications: A multi-perspective, systematic study provides a holistic guide for practitioners in understanding cyber-physical systems. The cyber risk challenges and the mitigation strategies identified support supply chain managers in making informed decisions.

Telehealth and telemedicine services, especially, fulfilled their promise by allowing patients to receive advice and care at a distance, making it safer for all concerned. Over the preceding years, professional societies, governments, and scholars examined ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) related to telemedicine and telehealth. Primary concerns evident from reviewing this literature have been quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Objectives: To identify and summarize ethical, legal, and social issues related to information technology in healthcare, as exemplified by telehealth and telemedicine. To expand on prior analyses and address gaps illuminated by the COVID-19 experience. To propose future research directions. Methods: Literature was identified through searches, forward and backward citation chaining, and the author's knowledge of scholars and works in the area. EU and professional organizations’ guidelines, and nineteen scholarly papers were examined and categories created to identify ethical, legal, and social issues they addressed. A synthesis matrix was developed to categorize issues addressed by each source. Results: A synthesis matrix was developed and issues categorized as: quality of care, consent and autonomy, access to care and technology, legal and regulatory, clinician responsibilities, patient responsibilities, changed relationships, commercialization, policy, information needs, and evaluation, with subcategories that fleshed out each category. The literature primarily addressed quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Other identified considerations were little discussed. These and newer concerns include: usability, tailoring services to each patient, curriculum and training, implementation, commercialization, and licensing and liability. The need for interoperability, data availability, cybersecurity, and informatics infrastructure also is more apparent. These issues are applicable to other information technologies in healthcare. Conclusions: Clinicians and organizations need updated guidelines for ethical use of telemedicine and telehealth care, and decision- and policy-makers need evidence to inform decisions. The variety of newly implemented telemedicine services is an on-going natural experiment presenting an unparalleled opportunity to develop an evidence-based way forward. The paper recommends evaluation using an applied ethics, context-sensitive approach that explores interactions among multiple factors and considerations. It suggests evaluation questions to investigate ethical, social, and legal issues through multi-method, sociotechnical, interpretive and ethnographic, and interactionist evaluation approaches. Such evaluation can help telehealth, and other information technologies, be integrated into healthcare ethically and effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094908647

One essential part of cybersecurity is intrusion detection, which identifies anomalous activities according to traffic patterns. However, the class-imbalanced data have caused a challenging problem where the number of abnormal samples is significantly lower than that of the normal ones. This class imbalance problem confines the performance of intrusion classifiers and results in low robustness to unknown anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel Imbalanced Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN) to tackle the class imbalance problem. In the primary novelty of our model, we introduce an imbalanced data filter and convolutional layers to the typical GAN, generating new representative instances for minority classes. Further, an IGAN-based Intrusion Detection System, namely IGAN-IDS, is established to cope with class-imbalanced intrusion detection, using the instances generated by IGAN. Concretely, IGAN-IDS consists of three modules: feature extraction, IGAN, and deep neural network. First, we utilize a feed-forward neural network (FNN) to transform raw network attributes into feature vectors. Then, the IGAN generates new samples expressed in the latent space. Finally, the deep neural network, composed of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers, executes the final intrusion detection. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of IGAN-IDS, comparing against 15 other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed IGAN-IDS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084332969

However, what if an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) itself is attacked; in other words what defends the defender? In this work, the focus is on countering attacks on machine learning-based cyberattack detectors. In principle, we propose the adversarial machine learning detection solution. Indeed, contemporary machine learning algorithms have not been designed bearing in mind the adversarial nature of the environments they are deployed in. Thus, Machine Learning solutions are currently the target of a range of attacks. This paper evaluates the possibility of deteriorating the performance of a well-optimised intrusion detection algorithm at test time by crafting adversarial attacks with the four of the recently proposed methods and then offers a way to detect those attacks. The relevant background is provided for both artificial neural networks and four ways of crafting adversarial attacks. The new detection method is explained in detail, and the results of five different classifiers are compared. To the best of our knowledge, detecting adversarial attacks on artificial neural networks has not yet been widely researched in the context of intrusion detection systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083297694

The potential threats to IoT applications and the need to reduce risk have recently become an interesting research topic. It is crucial that effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) tailored to IoT applications be developed. Such IDSs require an updated and representative IoT dataset for training and evaluation. However, there is a lack of benchmark IoT and IIoT datasets for assessing IDSs-enabled IoT systems. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a new data-driven IoT/IIoT dataset with the ground truth that incorporates a label feature indicating normal and attack classes, as well as a type feature indicating the sub-classes of attacks targeting IoT/IIoT applications for multi-classification problems. The proposed dataset, which is named TON-IoT, includes Telemetry data of IoT/IIoT services, as well as Operating Systems logs and Network traffic of IoT network, collected from a realistic representation of a medium-scale network at the Cyber Range and IoT Labs at the UNSW Canberra (Australia). This paper also describes the proposed dataset of the Telemetry data of IoT/IIoT services and their characteristics. TON-IoT has various advantages that are currently lacking in the state-of-the-art datasets: i) it has various normal and attack events for different IoT/IIoT services, and ii) it includes heterogeneous data sources. We evaluated the performance of several popular Machine Learning (ML) methods and a Deep Learning model in both binary and multi-class classification problems for intrusion detection purposes using the proposed Telemetry dataset. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Anomaly detection is carried out by every agent separately, but the final decision depends on the consensus among all interconnected agents.

For example, Low-Rate DDoS (LR-DDoS) attacks are known to be difficult to detect, particularly in a software-defined network (SDN). Hence, in this paper we present a flexible modular architecture that allows the identification and mitigation of LR-DDoS attacks in SDN settings. Specifically, we train the intrusion detection system (IDS) in our architecture using six machine learning (ML) models (i.e., J48, Random Tree, REP Tree, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)) and evaluate their performance using the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity (CIC) DoS dataset. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that our approach achieves a detection rate of 95%, despite the difficulty in detecting LR-DoS attacks. We also remark that in our deployment, we use the open network operating system (ONOS) controller running on Mininet virtual machine in order for our simulated environment to be as close to real-world production networks as possible. In our testing topology, the intrusion prevention detection system mitigates all attacks previously detected by the IDS system.

These methods offer the freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain (digital thread) with the physical supply chain and their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further, we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082294158

Recently, the machine learning (ML)-based approach has attracted increasing interest in the research of software vulnerability detection. However, the detection performance of existing ML-based methods require further improvement. There are two challenges: one is code representation for ML and the other is class imbalance between vulnerable code and nonvulnerable code. To overcome these challenges, this article develops a DeepBalance system, which combines the new ideas of deep code representation learning and fuzzy-based class rebalancing. We design a deep neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory to learn invariant and discriminative code representations from labeled vulnerable and nonvulnerable code. Then, a new fuzzy oversampling method is employed to rebalance the training data by generating synthetic samples for the class of vulnerable code. To evaluate the performance of the new system, we carry out a series of experiments in a real-world ground-truth dataset that consists of the code from the projects of LibTIFF, LibPNG, and FFmpeg.

The IIoT is improving our lives in several ways including smarter cities, agriculture, and e-healthcare, etc. Although the IIoT shares several characteristics with the consumer IoT, different cybersecurity mechanisms are adopted for both networks. Unlike consumer IoT solutions that are used by an individual user for a single purpose, IIoT solutions tend to be integrated into larger operational systems. As a result, IIoT security solutions require additional planning and awareness to ensure the security and privacy of the system.

To predict the aforementioned attacks, a novel lightweight random neural network (RaNN)-based prediction model has been proposed in this article. To investigate the performance of the RaNN-based prediction model, several evaluation parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated and compared with the traditional artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT).

Several machine learning techniques have been developed to build network intrusion detection systems for correctly detecting unforeseen cyber-attacks at the network-level. For example, deep artificial neural network architectures have recently achieved state-of-the-art results. In this paper a novel deep neural network architecture is defined, in order to learn flexible and effective intrusion detection models, by combining an unsupervised stage for multi-channel feature learning with a supervised one exploiting feature dependencies on cross channels. The aim is to investigate whether class-specific features of the network flows could be learned and added to the original ones in order to increase the model accuracy. In particular, in the unsupervised stage, two autoencoders are separately learned on normal and attack flows, respectively. As the top layer in the decoder of these autoencoders reconstructs samples in the same space as the input one, they could be used to define two new feature vectors allowing the representation of each network flow as a multi-channel sample. In the supervised stage, a multi-channel parametric convolution is adopted, in order to learn the effect of each channel on the others. In particular, as the samples belong to two different distributions (normal and attack flows), the samples labelled as normal should be more similar to the representation reconstructed with the normal autoencoder than that of the attack one, and viceversa. This expected dependency will be exploited to better disentangle the differences between normal and attack flows. The proposed neural network architecture leads to better predictive accuracy when compared to competitive intrusion detection architectures on three benchmark datasets. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082684135

As a result, information on the charging patterns of PEVs is becoming accessible via smartphone applications, which aggregate real-time availability and historical usage of public PEV charging stations. Moreover, information on the power grid infrastructure and operations has become increasingly available in technical documents and real-time dashboards of the utilities, affiliates, and the power grid operators. The research question that this study explores is: Can one combine high-wattage demand-side appliances with public information to launch cyberattacks on the power grid? To answer this question and report a proof of concept demonstration, the study scrapes data from public sources for Manhattan, NY, USA using the electric vehicle charging station smartphone application and the power grid data circulated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, New York Independent System Operator, and the local utility in New York. It then designs a novel data-driven cyberattack strategy using state-feedback based partial eigenvalue relocation, which targets frequency stability of the power grid. The study establishes that while such an attack is not possible at the current penetration level of PEVs, it will be practical once the number of PEVs increases. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094867546

Realizing the strength of blockchain technology beyond the successful application in the cryptocurrency arena, researchers have been evaluating and using blockchain for applications such as supply chain management, transactive industry (both financial and energy), system integrity, device cybersecurity, identity management, and much more. One of the unique elements of the blockchain technology that made it such a captivating technology to researchers is its plethora of features. Some of the features include smart contracts, cryptocurrency and tokenizing, immutable distributed ledger, cryptographic hashing, and digital signature. In addition, there are multiple types of blockchains, such as permissioned/private and permissionless/public, and various consensus models, such as proof-of-work, proof-of-authority, proof-of-burn, and proof-of-stake. Therefore, it is often nontrivial to determine if an application requires a blockchain. If so, what kind of blockchain and consensus is most appropriate? This article discusses the blockchain applicability framework (BAF), which was specifically designed with the purpose to answer those questions. The BAF is divided into five domains, 18 subdomains, and about 100 controls. It is designed to ingest detailed user requirements to perform a weighted evaluation that is built on mathematical constructs to determine the ideal combination of blockchain that is appropriate for an application. Along with the core logical formulation of the BAF, this article depicts the efficacy of the BAF through two use cases. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089308230

Most of the exchanged data between the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are not adequately secured due to resource constraints on IoT devices. Attribute Based SignCryption (ABSC) is a powerful cryptographic mechanism suitable for distributed environments, providing flexible access control and data secrecy. However, it imposes high designcryption costs, and does not support access policy update (user addition/revocation). This paper presents PROUD, an ABSC solution, to securely outsource data designcryption process to edge servers in order to reduce the computation overhead on the user side. PROUD allows end-users to offload most of the designcryption overhead to an edge server and verify the correctness of the received partially designcrypted data from the edge server. Moreover, PROUD provides the access policy update feature with neither involving a proxy-server, nor re-signcrypting the signcrypted message and re-distributing the users’ secret keys. The access policy update feature in PROUD does not affect the size of the message received by the end-user which reduces the bandwidth and the storage usage.

While researchers propose detectors for FDI, such countermeasures neglect power state changes due to contingencies. As such an abrupt physical change negatively affects existing FDI detectors, they will provide incorrect classification of the new instances. To resolve the problem, we conducted analysis for a fundamental understanding of the differences between a physical grid change and data manipulation change. We use outage as an example and propose to analyze historical data followed by concept drift, focusing on distribution change. The key is to find critical lines to narrow down the scope. Techniques such as dimensionality reduction and statistical hypothesis testing are employed. The proposed approach is evaluated on the IEEE 14 bus system using load data from the New York independent system operator with two different attack scenarios: (1) attacks without concept drift, (2) attacks under concept drift.

However, besides the many good promises of the smart grid, such as better peak control, cheaper maintenance, and more open energy markets, there are many new security threats evolving, especially from the IoT side, and also from the diversification of the systems and practices that the smart grid brings. We thus see the need for more light-weight and dynamic methods for conducting security analyses of systems applicable at (re)design time, intended to help system engineers build secure systems from the start. As a consequence, the methods should also look more at the functionalities (exposure/protection) of the system than at the possible attacks. In this paper we propose a methodology called Smart Grid Security Classification (SGSC) developed for complex systems like the smart grid, focusing on the specifics of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems. Our methodology is built upon the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systémes d'information (ANSSI) standard methodology for security classification of general Information and Communication Systems (ICS). Analyses performed following our method easily translate into ANSSI valid reports. Our SGSC is related to methods of risk analysis with the difference that our classification method has the purpose to assign a system to a security class, based on (combinations of) scores given to the various exposure aspects of the system and the respective protection mechanisms implemented; without looking at attackers. There are multiple uses of SGSC, such as offering indications to decision-makers about the security aspects of a system and for deciding purchasing strategies, for regulatory bodies to certify various complex infrastructure systems, but also for system/security designers to make easier choices of correct functionalities that would allow to reach a desired level of security. Particularly useful for smart grid systems is the discussion and mapping that we do of the SGSC methodology to a complex AMI infrastructure description derived from real deployments being done in ongoing Norwegian smart grid upgrades. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080084283

To address this risk, we introduce a novel algorithm to extract the real-time model parameters of the CAN bus and develop SAIDuCANT, a specification-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with the real-time model as input. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAIDuCANT with real CAN logs collected from two passenger cars and on an open-source CAN dataset collected from real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that SAIDuCANT can effectively detect data injection attacks with low false positive rates.

With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution and the IoE era, industrial control systems (ICSs) are transitioning into industrial IoE (IIoE). The ICS, which is no longer a closed network, suffers from various cybersecurity threats. Since the attack of Stuxnet in 2010, the malware used to attack critical infrastructure (CI) has become increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, recent attacks have mimicked normal network traffic. Therefore, investigating intrusion detection systems is necessary to detect these advanced cyberattacks. However, detecting advanced attacks, such as false data injection, is difficult because the traditional detection methods focus only on the protocol header fields. Most studies have not considered low-performance field devices, which are vulnerable to threats. Therefore, we have classified the extended reference model RAMI 4.0, which is the new ICS reference model in the fourth industrial revolution, into two levels: an operative level and a product process management level. A fast and lightweight algorithm is required at the operative level because the low-performance devices communicate with each other in real time. In addition, efficient data processing is important because considerable amount of data is concentrated at the product process management level. Based on these characteristics, a payload-based abnormal behavior detection method, i.e., the autoencoder-based payload anomaly detection (APAD), is proposed for each level. APAD uses an autoencoder to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors in low-performance devices. Furthermore, traffic analysis and a considerable amount of time are required to apply a traditional detection method at the product process management level. However, the proposed method does not require long-time traffic analysis. It exhibits a higher detection rate compared with those exhibited by other methods based on verification using the open secure water treatment dataset called SWaT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077004427

However, as models become more and more complex, people can hardly get the explanations behind their decisions. At the same time, most of the works about model interpretation focuses on other fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and biology. This leads to the fact that in practical use, cybersecurity experts can hardly optimize their decisions according to the judgments of the model. To solve these issues, a framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs. This framework uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and combines local and global explanations to improve the interpretation of IDSs. The local explanations give the reasons why the model makes certain decisions on the specific input. The global explanations give the important features extracted from IDSs, present the relationships between the feature values and different types of attacks. At the same time, the interpretations between two different classifiers, one-vs-all classifier and multiclass classifier, are compared. NSL-KDD dataset is used to test the feasibility of the framework. The framework proposed in this paper leads to improve the transparency of any IDS, and helps the cybersecurity staff have a better understanding of IDSs' judgments. Furthermore, the different interpretations between different kinds of classifiers can also help security experts better design the structures of the IDSs. More importantly, this work is unique in the intrusion detection field, presenting the first use of the SHAP method to give explanations for IDSs. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084335919

This necessitates a robust and lightweight security architecture and schemes as the existing traditional Internet security architecture and protocols require huge resources and lack of end-to-end security mechanism. In this research, a resource efficient end-to-end security scheme has been proposed by offloading computations and storage of security parameters to fog nodes in the vicinity. In addition, a symmetric-key payload encryption has been used to minimize the overhead of message communication in the resource-contested IoT environment. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme outperforms Transport Layer Security (TLS) in resource usage while it maintains equivalent authenticated end-to-end communication between communicating IoT nodes. The proposed end-to-end security scheme saves more communication bandwidth and incurs less overhead as compared to existing TLS-based security schemes. In particular, the proposed system uses less number of handshakes and achieves a decrease in the number of transmitted messages (approximately 184 bytes as compared to compared TSL message size of 332 bytes) for every handshake. Further, it has been demonstrated through experiments that the proposed security method incurs less overheads as compared to the TLS bandwidth consumption considering a single connection session during message subscription. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083402680

This paper argues that attempts to apply sovereignty to cyberspace governance are inappropriate to the domain. It develops a technically grounded definition of “cyberspace” and examines its characteristics as a distinct domain for action, conflict, and governance, while clarifying its relationship to territoriality. It reviews the literature on cyberspace and sovereignty since the early 1990s, showing the emergence of explicitly pro-sovereigntist ideas and practices in the last ten years. The cyber-sovereignty debate is linked to IR research on the historical emergence of sovereignty, demonstrating how technologies routinely change the basis of international order and challenging the presumption that territorial sovereignty is a stable and uniform principle of international organization that can be presumptively applied to the internet. The paper also links the conceptual debate over cyber-sovereignty to the real-world geopolitical struggle over the governance of the internet, showing how different conceptions of sovereignty serve the interests of different powers, notably the United States, Russia, and China. The paper explores the relevance of an alternative governance model for cyberspace based on the global commons concept. It refutes the arguments made against that model and then explains what difference it might make to governance if we conceive of cyberspace in that way. © The Author(s) (2019).

While there is a considerable effort to investigate attacks and defense strategies in these tasks, only limited work explores the influence of targeted attacks on input data (e.g., images, textual descriptions, audio) used in multimedia recommender systems (MR). In this work, we examine the consequences of applying targeted adversarial attacks against the product images of a visual-based MR. We propose a novel adversarial attack approach, called Target Adversarial Attack against Multimedia Recommender Systems (TAaMR), to investigate the modification of MR behavior when the images of a category of low recommended products (e.g., socks) are perturbed to misclassify the deep neural classifier towards the class of more recommended products (e.g., running shoes) with human-level slight images alterations. We explore the TAaMR approach studying the effect of two targeted adversarial attacks (i.e., FGSM and PGD) against input pictures of two state-of-the-art MR (i.e., VBPR and AMR).

The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) is one of the most popular models for quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment. It provides a taxonomic framework to classify cybersecurity risk into a set of quantifiable risk factors and combines this with quantitative algorithms, in the form of a kind of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation combined with statistical approximation techniques, to estimate cybersecurity risk. However, the FAIR algorithms restrict both the type of statistical distributions that can be used and the expandability of the model structure. Moreover, the applied approximation techniques (including using cached data and interpolation methods) introduce inaccuracy into the FAIR model. To address restrictions of the FAIR model, we develop a more flexible alternative approach, which we call FAIR-BN, to implement the FAIR model using Bayesian Networks (BNs). To evaluate the performance of FAIR and FAIR-BN, we use a MC method (FAIR-MC) to implement calculations of the FAIR model without using any of the approximation techniques adopted by FAIR, thus avoiding the corresponding inaccuracy that can be introduced. We compare the empirical results generated by FAIR and FAIR-BN against a large number of samples generated using FAIR-MC. Both FAIR and FAIR-BN provide consistent results compared with FAIR-MC for general cases. However, the FAIR-BN achieves higher accuracy in several cases that cannot be accurately modelled by the FAIR model.

This paper presents an investigation of the encryption efficiency of the chaotic-based image block ciphering in the spatial and Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) domains. The main aim of this investigation is to examine the efficiency of different chaotic maps, while considering the parameters of the FrFT as additional keys for encryption and achieving reliable cybersecurity for robust image communication. In this paper, Cat, Baker, and Logistic map confusion approaches are applied in the spatial and FrFT domains to study and analyze the cybersecurity and ciphering efficiency of chaos-based image cryptosystems. The confusion features of the chaotic maps in spatial and FrFT domains are investigated using information entropy, differential analysis, histograms, visual observation, attack analysis, impact of noise, and encryption quality tests. Simulation results prove that the chaotic-based image encryption in the FrFT domain increases the efficiency of the confusion process and achieves a high nonlinear relation between the plainimage and the cipherimage in a symmetric ciphering approach. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the Cat-FrFT scheme is more susceptible to channel noise attacks than the Baker-FrFT and the Logistic-FrFT schemes. Hence, they can be implemented efficiently in the scenarios of noisy channels due to their high robustness to channel noise. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081591405

The risks born out of these IoT systems cannot easily fit into an existing risk framework. There are many cybersecurity risk assessment approaches and frameworks that are under deployment in many governmental and commercial organizations. Extending these existing frameworks to IoT systems alone will not address the new risks that have arisen in the IoT ecosystem. This study has included a review of existing popular cyber risk assessment methodologies and their suitability to IoT systems. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation, Threat Assessment & Remediation Analysis, and International Standards Organization are the four main frameworks critically analyzed in this research study. IoT risks are presented and reviewed in terms of the IoT risk category and impacted industries. IoT systems in financial technology and healthcare are dealt with in detail, given their high-risk exposure. Risk vectors for IoT and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are discussed in this study. A unique risk ranking method to rank and quantify IoT risk is introduced in this study. This ranking method initiates a risk assessment approach exclusively for IoT systems by quantifying IoT risk vectors, leading to effective risk mitigation strategies and techniques. A unique computational approach to calculate the cyber risk for IoT systems with IoT-specific impact factors has been designed and explained in the context of IoMT systems. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085376319

Although there is substantial literature on the threats technological vulnerabilities have on the health care industry, less research exists on how pandemics like COVID-19 are opportunistic for cybercriminals. This paper outlines why cyberattacks have been particularly problematic during COVID-19 and ways that health care industries can better protect patient data. The Office for Civil Rights has loosened enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which, although useful in using new platforms like Zoom, has also loosened physical and technical safeguards to cyberattacks. This is especially problematic given that 90% of health care providers had already encountered data breaches. Companies must implement well-defined software upgrade procedures, should use secure networks like virtual local area networks, and conduct regular penetration tests of their systems. By understanding factors that make individuals, health care organizations, and employers more susceptible to cyberattacks, we can better prepare for the next pandemic. © Christina Meilee Williams, Rahul Chaturvedi, Krishnan Chakravarthy.

We analyze the differences between coordinated and uncoordinated cybersecurity investments, as well as the differences resulting from a strategic and a non-strategic attacker. We find that lack of coordination leads to underinvestment with a non-strategic attacker, but that this is somewhat counterbalanced by an attacker being strategic. Lack of coordination may lead to either underinvestment or overinvestment with a strategic attacker, depending on how large the indirect damages from attacks are relative to the direct damages; overinvestment is more likely if indirect damages are relatively minor.

The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators, and none of the authors published their dataset.

Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations.

This method models user behavior as sequences of user events including operation of home IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other monitored activities. Considering users behave depending on the condition of the home such as time and temperature, our method learns event sequences for each condition. To mitigate the impact of events of other users in the home included in the monitored sequence, our method generates multiple event sequences by removing some events and learning the frequently observed sequences. For evaluation, we constructed an experimental network of home IoT devices and recorded time data for four users entering/leaving a room and operating devices. We obtained detection ratios exceeding 90% for anomalous operations with less than 10% of misdetections when our method observed event sequences related to the operation.

Accelerating inexact string matching procedures is of utmost importance when dealing with practical applications where huge amounts of data must be processed in real time, as usual in bioinformatics or cybersecurity. Inexact matching procedures can yield multiple shadow hits, which must be filtered, according to some criterion, to obtain a concise and meaningful list of occurrences. The filtering procedures are often computationally demanding and are performed offline in a post-processing phase. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for online approximate string matching (OASM) able to filter shadow hits on the fly, according to general purpose priority rules that greedily assign priorities to overlapping hits. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware implementation of OASM is proposed and compared with a serial software version.

When it comes to education, and more particularly in any Engineering subject, practical learning scenarios are key to achieve a set of competencies and applied skills. In our particular case, the cybersecurity topic with a distance education methodology is considered and a new remote virtual laboratory based on containers will be presented and evaluated in this work. The laboratory is based on the Linux Docker virtualization technology, which allows us to create consistent realistic scenarios with lower configuration requirements for the students. The laboratory is comparatively evaluated with our previous environment, LoT@UNED, from both the points of view of the students' acceptance with a set of UTAUT models, and their behavior regarding evaluation items, time distribution, and content resources. All data was obtained from students' surveys and platform registers. The main conclusion of this work is that the proposed laboratory obtains a very high acceptance from the students, in terms of several different indicators (perceived usefulness, estimated effort, social influence, attitude, ease of access, and intention of use). Neither the use of the virtual platform nor the distance methodology employed affect the intention to use the technology proposed in this work. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081240169

E-government is one of the most complex systems which needs to be distributed, secured and privacy-preserved, and the failure of these can be very costly both economically and socially. Most of the existing e-government systems such as websites and electronic identity management systems (eIDs) are centralized at duplicated servers and databases. A centralized management and validation system may suffer from a single point of failure and make the system a target to cyber attacks such as malware, denial of service attacks (DoS), and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS). The blockchain technology enables the implementation of highly secure and privacy-preserving decentralized systems where transactions are not under the control of any third party organizations. Using the blockchain technology, exiting data and new data are stored in a sealed compartment of blocks (i.e., ledger) distributed across the network in a verifiable and immutable way. Information security and privacy are enhanced by the blockchain technology in which data are encrypted and distributed across the entire network. This paper proposes a framework of a decentralized e-government peer-to-peer (p2p) system using the blockchain technology, which can ensure both information security and privacy while simultaneously increasing the trust of the public sectors. In addition, a prototype of the proposed system is presented, with the support of a theoretical and qualitative analysis of the security and privacy implications of such system. © 2018, The Author(s).",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091513441

Despite efforts to improve information security compliance, hospitals still significantly suffer from such attacks, impacting the quality of care and the safety of patients. Objective: This study aimed to investigate why hospital employees decide to click on phishing emails by analyzing actual clicking data. Methods: We first gauged the factors that influence clicking behavior using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and integrating trust theories. We then conducted a survey in hospitals and used structural equation modeling to investigate the components of compliance intention. We matched employees' survey results with their actual clicking data from phishing campaigns. Results: Our analysis (N=397) reveals that TPB factors (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control), as well as collective felt trust and trust in information security technology, are positively related to compliance intention. However, compliance intention is not significantly related to compliance behavior. Only the level of employees' workload is positively associated with the likelihood of employees clicking on a phishing link. Conclusions: This is one of the few studies in information security and decision making that observed compliance behavior by analyzing clicking data rather than using self-reported data. We show that, in the context of phishing emails, intention and compliance might not be as strongly linked as previously assumed; hence, hospitals must remain vigilant with vulnerabilities that cannot be easily managed. Importantly, given the significant association between workload and noncompliance behavior (ie, clicking on phishing links), hospitals should better manage employees' workload to increase information security. Our findings can help health care organizations augment employees' compliance with their cybersecurity policies and reduce the likelihood of clicking on phishing links. © 2020 Mohammad S S.

Despite the steady advances in HEMS technology, there are still several barriers impeding its acceptance. This paper investigates the multifaceted factors influencing residents' willingness to adopt and pay for HEMS in New York (N.Y.) and Tokyo areas. Our findings suggest that perceived usefulness, a favorable attitude toward HEMS, and social norms are positively associated with adoption intention in both areas. While lacking perceived behavioral control is a barrier for adoption intention in Tokyo, privacy and cybersecurity concerns are barriers for N.Y. residents. The majority of residents indicate a strong or moderately strong adoption intention even when their cost concerns are great. Cost concerns, however, are associated with low willingness to pay (WTP) in both areas, as is perceived ease of use. Technology anxiety only negatively affects WTP in Tokyo. Positive attitudes, social norms, and perceived usefulness are positive predictors of WTP in both areas. Younger and higher-income were associated with higher WTP only in N.Y. Unexpectedly, trust in utilities is not a significant predictor of adoption intention or WTP.

However, the open-access environment makes the cooperating platoon CAVs vulnerable to cyberattacks, causing concerns on traffic safety and mobility. So far, due to the lack of analytical models integrating malicious effects of manipulated information into CAV dynamics, we have limited knowledge on CAV platoon performance under cyberattack. It necessities a modeling framework to support a comprehensive analysis of the CAV platoon performance in a capricious travel environment. This study seeks to bridge this critical gap from the following three aspects. First, we review potential safety-related cyberattacks faced by CAVs, related to manipulation of vehicle position, speed, and acceleration. Based on the review, these cyberattacks are categorized into three types: bogus messages, replay/delay, and collusion attack. Second, we develop a generalized vehicle dynamics model that accounts for the cyberattack effects on CAV dynamics. The proposed model, labeled cooperative intelligent driver model (CIDM), integrates the dynamic communication topological structure to enable the analysis of effects of manipulated information on CAV dynamics. The dynamic communication structure is a time-varying function which is determined by the communication range and the distance between two vehicles. Upon the proposed CIDM, the third aspect focuses on simulation analysis of CAV platoon safety and efficiency under cyberattacks, which demonstrate the cyberattack effects at the platoon level. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of CAV platoon dynamics under cyberattacks and lays a foundation to enhance the cybersecurity of CAV systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082872041

The paper discusses and evaluates the different 3D printing techniques in construction. The paper also discusses and categorizes the benefits, challenges, and risks of 3D printing in construction. The use of 3D printing technology offers several advantages over traditional methods. However, it comes with its own additional challenges and risks. The main benefits of 3D printing in construction include constructability and sustainability benefits. The challenges are categorized into seven groups. The main challenges, found through the literature, are material related. The most cited challenges are material printability, buildability, and open time. Additionally, scalability, structural integrity, and lack of codes and regulations are frequently cited as major challenges. The additional risks are categorized into seven groups: 3D printing material, 3D printing equipment, construction site, and environment, management, stakeholders, regulatory and economic, and cybersecurity risks. The paper fills a gap in the literature as it addresses a new aspect of 3D printing, which is risk. The paper also provides some insights, recommendations, and future research ideas.

CTI represents actionable threat information that is relevant to a specific organization and that thus demands its close attention. CTI efforts aim to help organizations “know their enemies better” for proactive, preventive, and timely threat detection and remediation—complementing conventional risk-management paradigms designed to improve ‘general readiness’ against known or unknown threats. Organizational security (OrgSec) and behavioral security research has lagged behind CTI's growing potential to address current cybersecurity challenges. Instead, CTI has largely been the purview of computer science from an algorithmic perspective. However, OrgSec and behavioral researchers can contribute a further combined knowledge of design for the organization, human factors, and organizational governance to foster CTI. In this theory-building and review manuscript, we propose the CTI capability model (CTI-CM) to prescribe the key capabilities necessary for a CTI practitioner to engage effectively in CTI activities. The CTI-CM defines a practitioner's CTI capability in terms of three highly interrelated but conceptually distinctive dimensions: analytical component capability, contextual response capability, and experiential practice capability. We further explain how these capabilities can be fostered, and the key implications for leading security practice in organizations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079889387

In the light of curbing phishing, blacklisting of websites proved ineffective as the deployment of phishing websites are rampantly increasing and often short-lived. Hence, machine learning (ML) methods are seen as viable measures and used to develop deplorable models that can detect a phishing website. ML methods are fast gaining attention and acceptance in detecting phishing websites as they can cope with the dynamism of phishing websites and attackers. However, ML methods still suffer some shortcomings in terms of low detection accuracy, high false alarm rate (FAR) and induced bias of developed ML solutions. In addition, with the evolving nature of phishing attacks, there is a continuing imperative need for novel and effective ML-based methods for detecting phishing websites. This study proposed 3 meta-learner models based on Forest Penalizing Attributes (ForestPA) algorithm. ForestPA uses a weight assignment and weight increment strategy to build highly efficient decision trees by exploiting the prowess of all attributes (non-class inclusive) in a given dataset. From the experimental results, the proposed meta-learners (ForestPA-PWDM, Bagged-ForestPA-PWDM, and Adab-ForestPA-PWDM) are highly efficient with the least accuracy of 96.26%, 0.004 FAR, and 0.994 ROC value.

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes an effective IID method based on federated learning (FL) aided long short-term memory (FL-LSTM) framework. First, the initial LSTM global model is deployed at all of user servers. Second, each user trains its single model and then uploads its model parameters to central server. Finally, the central server performs model parameters aggregation to form a new global model and distributes it to user servers. Use this step as a loop for communication to complete the training of the intrusion detection model.

Previous social engineering research in a real-world setting has shown an interaction between the personality of the target and the persuasion principle used. This study investigated whether this interaction is present in the realm of email phishing. Additionally, a signal detection theory framework was used to evaluate how the various persuasion principles influence accuracy, sensitivity (d’), and response criterion placement. A personality inventory and an email identification task (phishing or legitimate) were used. These data support previous findings that high extroversion is predictive of increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. The various persuasions principles elicited diverse response criterions and sensitivities, though all investigated persuasion principles resulted in a liberal decision criterion, except one.

To alleviate this problem, telemedicine is increasingly being viewed as an effective means through which patients can be diagnosed and medications prescribed by doctors via untact Thus, concomitant with developments in information and communication technology (ICT), medical institutions have actively analyzed and applied ICT to medical systems to provide optimal medical services. However, with the convergence of these diverse technologies, various risks and security threats have emerged. To protect patients and improve telemedicine quality for patient safety, it is necessary to analyze these risks and security threats comprehensively and institute appropriate countermeasures. Methods: The security threats likely to be encountered in each of seven telemedicine service areas were analyzed, and related data were collected directly through on-site surveys by a medical institution. Subsequently, an attack tree, the most popular reliability and risk modeling approach for systematically characterizing the potential risks of telemedicine systems, was examined and utilized with the attack occurrence probability and attack success probability as variables to provide a comprehensive risk assessment method. Results: In this study, the most popular modelling method, an attack tree, was applied to the telemedicine environment, and the security concerns for telemedicine systems were found to be very large. Risk management and evaluation methods suitable for the telemedicine environment were identified, and their benefits and potential limitations were assessed. Conclusion: This research should be beneficial to security experts who wish to investigate the impacts of cybersecurity threats on remote healthcare and researchers who wish to identify new modeling opportunities to apply security risk modeling techniques. © 2020 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086355216

Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments. © 2020 ACM.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087858767

However, traditional data crowdsourcing platforms are almost invariably based on a centralized architecture, which tends to give unfair advantages to the platform operator; besides, centralized platforms are obvious targets for cybersecurity attacks and become a single point of failure. Furthermore, a centralized approach with stringent security control also suffers from serious scalability issue. For example, if data owners manage a database with large amounts of valuable data, they have to retrieve data from their database in accordance with certain access policies and encrypt retrieved data for each requester; hence they become bottlenecks in the data trading process when the number of requesters is very large. To address the above issues, we propose a blockchain-based mechanism for fine-grained authorization in data crowdsourcing (BC-FGA-DCrowd). In the BC-FGA-DCrowd scheme, we use a public blockchain to implement cryptocurrencies and payment services as incentive schemes for data trading platform users. With this approach, data owners can employ Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) to pre-process the complex encryption workload, and generate the attribute private key for data requester to achieve the fine-grained authorization. In this paper, we also prove that the BC-FGA-DCrowd scheme satisfies the correctness and fairness requirements of data trading, and can effectively withstand malicious activities of internal users and external DDos and Sybil attackers.

This research investigates the spectrum of risk of a cybersecurity incident taking place in the cyber-physical-enabled world using the VERIS Community Database. The findings were that the majority of known actors were from the US and Russia, most victims were from western states and geographic origin tended to reflect global affairs. The most commonly targeted asset was information, with the majority of attack modes relying on privilege abuse. The key feature observed was extensive internal security breaches, most often a result of human error. This tends to show that access in any form appears to be the source of vulnerability rather than incident specifics due to a fundamental trade-off between usability and security in the design of computer systems.

Watermarking, encryption, and steganography schemes are employed to attain multimedia data confidentiality and robustness. However, these schemes are externally applied on trusted computers, and there has been a lack of similar schemes that can be effectively and effciently enabled through an untrusted transmission medium. In this work, a self-embedding-based High-Effciency Video Coding (HEVC) transmission and integrity verification framework is presented. This framework is robust and reliable for verifying the integrity of HEVC frames transmitted through insecure communication channels. Firstly, the transmitted HEVC frames are divided into a number of blocks with a certain block size. After that, a discrete transform is used for self-embedding of watermarks from each block into another one depending on a predefined mechanism. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are tested for this task. The watermarked HEVC frames are transmitted through a wireless communication channel, and hence they become subject to different attacks and corruptions. At the receiver side, the secret watermarks in each block are sensed with a correlation-based method to discover dubious counterfeit operations. To verify the reliability of the suggested transmission framework and its ability to achieve high protection and robust content verification of the transmitted HEVC frames over insecure communication channels, different HEVC analyses and comparisons are performed. Simulation results demonstrate the suitability of the suggested transmission framework for different multimedia cybersecurity applications. Furthermore, the comparative analysis shows that the DFT is an effcient discrete transform that can be employed with the proposed transmission framework to guarantee a higher HEVC frame integrity. It allows higher sensitivity to simple modifications in the transmitted watermarked HEVC frames. This makes the suggested cybersecurity framework applicable, secure, and appropriate for multimedia integrity verification purposes. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This is attributed to the fact that conventional security processes are not appropriate for robust, efficient, and reliable multimedia streaming over unsecure media. Therefore, this paper presents an efficient color image cryptosystem based on RC6 with different modes of operation. The proposed cryptosystem is composed of two phases: Encryption and decryption. The encryption phase starts by decomposing the color plainimage with few details into its RGB components, which in turn, are segmented into 128-bit blocks. These blocks are then enciphered using RC6 with an appropriate mode of operation. After that, the corresponding enciphered blocks of RGB components are multiplexed for constructing the final cipherimage. This scenario is reversed in the decryption phase. The performance of the proposed cryptosystem is gauged via simulation using a set of encryption quality metrics. The simulation results reveal that the proposed cryptosystem with cipher block chaining (CBC), cipher feedback (CFB), and output feedback (OFB) modes can efficiently and effectively hide all information of the color images with few details even in the presence of some input blocks with similar data. On the other hand, the results show that the electronic codebook (ECB) mode is not effective at all in hiding all details of images.

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities have been reported concerning the security of transmission of data between a patient's device and the transceiver, so manufacturers should use secure communication protocols. Patients need to be informed how their remotely monitored data will be handled and used, and their informed consent should be sought before their device is implanted. Review of consent forms in current use revealed great variability in length and content, and sometimes very technical language; therefore, a standard information sheet and generic consent form are proposed. Cardiologists who care for patients with CIEDs that are remotely monitored should be aware of these issues. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096152808

It boosts the power system with the advantage of using intelligent infrastructure to aid monitoring, protection, bidirectional communication, supply safety, security and self-healing characteristics. ICT infrastructures are integrated into the power network by using technologies, such as active distribution networks, smart cities and societies, dynamic line ratings, special protection schemes and demand-side management programmes. Deployment of these technologies has beneficial impacts on the reliability of power systems. However, these infrastructures are naturally prone to failures and cybersecurity issues because of Internet of things standards, which can further jeopardise system reliability. Various studies have examined the effect of these technologies on the reliability of power systems whilst ignoring that the associated ICTs could be unavailable. Thus, this work comprehensively reviews studies that go beyond component-based reliability assessment and accounts for the impact of ICT integrations on system-wide reliability whilst explicitly considering the effects of malfunctions of the cyber system. Moreover, the paper presents quantitative and qualitative information about the impact of ICT deployed with various smart grid technologies and applications on the reliability of modern power systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087986395

The goal of this research is to describe the technologies that are enablers of I4, analyze the human talent needed and the qualifications (competencies/skills) required to manage I4 systems, describe the courses and practices that leading universities in engineering and technology are teaching for developing the I4 workforce, and provide a look to the future by presenting trends related to education in I4. Autonomous robots, simulation, horizontal and vertical integration, the Industrial Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, cybersecurity, the cloud, and Big Data and analytics are technologies considered pillars of the I4 approach. Nowadays, there are universities already offering programs related to I4. These range from those aimed at presenting the concepts of I4 to those in which students learn how to handle related technologies in real work in global enterprises. I4 is still evolving, and we present only a glimpse of what is required based on its current state.

Nowadays, the vehicles are connected to the car manufacturer network, the road operator networks, and the Internet. Such interconnections are used for infotainment applications and driving assistance services, such as real-time HD-maps, and road safety applications. For these reasons, the concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is increasingly emerging and, vehicles become Internet terminals exposed to cyber-attacks. In this context, the main weakness is given by the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. This protocol, which governs the in-vehicle network, was designed to reduce transmission error problems and minimize latency times. However, it does not employ any security facility to protect the communication. In particular, one of the main issues of this protocol is that it uses unencrypted communication. Improving the security of this protocol is necessary while preserving its performance in terms of communication efficiency. This paper investigates the possibility of using lightweight block ciphers to secure in-vehicle devices such as microcontrollers, which have constrained hardware and software capabilities. The results obtained have shown that this proposal while guaranteeing a high degree of safety, has a negligible impact on the vehicle's performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084650313

In addition, public attribution of cyber incidents takes place in a heavily contested information environment, creating fractured narratives of a shared past. The article uses three cyber incidents (Sony Pictures, DNC, and NotPetya) to show how actors cope with this contested information environment and proposes a changed role of academia to address some of the problems that emerge. To become competent in contesting public attribution discourses, universities would have to work more across physical, disciplinary, and academic boundaries. The main implications for democracies are to be more transparent about how attribution is performed, enable other civilian actors to study cyber conflict, and thereby broaden the discourse on cybersecurity politics. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The increasing number of various devices connected to IoT and their different protocols has led to growing volume of zero-day attacks. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its superiority in big data fields and cyber-security. Recently, DL has been used in cyber-attacks detection because of its capability of extracting and learning deep features of known attacks and detecting unknown attacks without the need for manual feature engineering. However, DL cannot be implemented on IoT devices with limited resources because it requires extensive computation, strong power and storage capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive attack detection framework of a distributed, robust, and high detection rate to detect several IoT cyber-attacks using DL. The proposed framework implements an attack detector on fog nodes because of its distributed nature, high computational capacity and proximity to edge devices. Six DL models are compared to identify the DL model with the best performance. All DL models are evaluated using five different datasets, each of which involves various attacks. Experiments show that the long short-term memory model outperforms the five other DL models.

Cybersecurity Information Exchange (CYBEX) is one of the important platforms which has been playing an important role in implementing proactive cyber defense system by allowing organizations sharing their cybersecurity information. However, they are centralized and therefore they may suffer from complete failure in case of any damage or accident. Moreover, while sharing private information it lacks the mechanism of providing rights to query organizations i.e., enabling the access control over the shared sensitive information. Finally, nonrepudiation of the system does not exist i.e., there is no way to track or keep the record what any organization is sharing and it is necessary to keep the record in case anyone denies after sharing false information. To address these issues, in this paper we propose blockchain based privacy preserving cybersecurity information sharing using proxy re-encryption and attribute-based encryption (BloCyNfo-Share) where the organization can achieve fine-grain access control by delegating which organization can have the access to its cybersecurity information leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology.

Nevertheless, IoT infrastructures are vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to the constraints in computation, storage, and communication capacity of the endpoint devices. From one side, the majority of newly developed cyber-attacks are formed by slightly mutating formerly established cyber-attacks to produce a new attack that tends to be treated as normal traffic through the IoT network. From the other side, the influence of coupling the deep learning techniques with the cybersecurity field has become a recent inclination of many security applications due to their impressive performance. In this paper, we provide the comprehensive development of a new intelligent and autonomous deep-learning-based detection and classification system for cyber-attacks in IoT communication networks that leverage the power of convolutional neural networks, abbreviated as IoT-IDCS-CNN (IoT based Intrusion Detection and Classification System using Convolutional Neural Network). The proposed IoT-IDCS-CNN makes use of high-performance computing that employs the robust Compute Unified Device Architectures (CUDA) based Nvidia GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) and parallel processing that employs high-speed I9-core-based Intel CPUs. In particular, the proposed system is composed of three subsystems: a feature engineering subsystem, a feature learning subsystem, and a traffic classification subsystem. All subsystems were developed, verified, integrated, and validated in this research. To evaluate the developed system, we employed the Network Security Laboratory-Knowledge Discovery Databases (NSL-KDD) dataset, which includes all the key attacks in IoT computing. The simulation results demonstrated a greater than 99.3% and 98.2% cyber-attack classification accuracy for the binary-class classifier (normal vs. anomaly) and the multiclass classifier (five categories), respectively. The proposed system was validated using a K-fold cross-validation method and was evaluated using the confusion matrix parameters (i.e., true negative (TN), true positive (TP), false negative (FN), false positive (FP)), along with other classification performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and false alarm rate. The test and evaluation results of the IoT-IDCS-CNN system outperformed many recent machine-learning-based IDCS systems in the same area of study. © 2020 by the authors.

We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures.

Despite the initial success of this detection approach, later analysis of proposed systems and detection features has shown that, like email spam, the dynamic and adversarial nature of social spam makes the performance achieved by supervised systems hard to maintain. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using the output of previously proposed supervised classification systems as a tool for spammers discovery. The hypothesis is that these systems are still highly capable of detecting spammers reliably even when their recall is far from perfect. We then propose to use the output of these classifiers as prior beliefs in a probabilistic graphical model framework. This framework allows beliefs to be propagated to similar social accounts. Basing similarity on a who-connects-to-whom network has been empirically critiqued in recent literature and we propose here an alternative definition based on a bipartite users-content interaction graph. For evaluation, we build a Markov Random Field on a graph of similar users and compute prior beliefs using a selection of state-of-the-art classifiers. We apply Loopy Belief Propagation to obtain posterior predictions on users. The proposed system is evaluated on a recent Twitter dataset that we collected and manually labeled. Classification results show a significant increase in recall and a maintained precision. This validates that formulating the detection problem with an undirected graphical model framework permits to restore the deteriorated performances of previously proposed statistical classifiers and to effectively mitigate the effect of spam evolution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086995477

At present, it is becoming increasingly important to assure that computer systems are secured from attacks due to modern society dependence from those systems. To prevent these attacks, nowadays most organizations make use of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Usually, IDS contain machine learning algorithms which aid in predicting or detecting anomalous patterns in computer systems. Most of these algorithms are supervised techniques, which contain gaps in the detection of unknown patterns or zero-day exploits, since these are not present in the algorithm learning phase. To address this problem, we present in this paper an empirical study of several unsupervised learning algorithms used in the detection of unknown attacks. In this study we evaluated and compared the performance of different types of anomaly detection techniques in two public available datasets: the NSL-KDD and the ISCX. The aim of this evaluation allows us to understand the behavior of these techniques and understand how they could be fitted in an IDS to fill the mentioned flaw. Also, the present evaluation could be used in the future, as a comparison of results with other unsupervised algorithms applied in the cybersecurity field. The results obtained show that the techniques used are capable of carrying out anomaly detection with an acceptable performance and thus making them suitable candidates for future integration in intrusion detection tools. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070775086

The development of a flexible and dynamic security system is required to tackle the new attacks. Current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) suffer to attain both the high detection rate and low false alarm rate. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an IDS using different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different ML models and DL models on Coburg intrusion detection datasets (CIDDSs). First, we compare different ML-and DL-based models on the CIDDS dataset. Second, we propose an ensemble model that combines the best ML and DL models to achieve high-performance metrics. Finally, we benchmarked our best models with the CIC-IDS2017 dataset and compared them with state-of-the-art models. While the popular IDS datasets like KDD99 and NSL-KDD fail to represent the recent attacks and suffer from network biases, CIDDS, used in this research, encompasses labeled flow-based data in a simulated office environment with both updated attacks and normal usage. Furthermore, both accuracy and interpretability must be considered while implementing AI models. Both ML and DL models achieved an accuracy of 99% on the CIDDS dataset with a high detection rate, low false alarm rate, and relatively low training costs. Feature importance was also studied using the Classification and regression tree (CART) model. Our models performed well in 10-fold cross-validation and independent testing. CART and convolutional neural network (CNN) with embedding achieved slightly better performance on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset compared to previous models. Together, these results suggest that both ML and DL methods are robust and complementary techniques as an effective network intrusion detection system. © 2020 by the authors.

To improve the cyber-security posture, it is important to develop effective methods for cyber-attack response and cyber-security risk assessment. In this research, we develop a finite-horizon semi-Markov general-sum game between the defender (i.e., plant operator) and the attacker to obtain the time-sensitive attack response strategy and the real-time risk assessment in nuclear power plants. We propose methods for identifying system states of concern to reduce the state space and for determining state transition probabilities by integrating Probabilistic Risk Assessment techniques. After a proper discretization of the developed continuous-time model, we use dynamic programming to derive the time-varying and state-dependent strategy of the defender based on the solution concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For risk assessment, three risk metrics are considered, and an exact analytical algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation-based algorithm for obtaining the metrics are developed. Both players’ strategies and the risk metrics are illustrated using a digital feedwater control system used in pressurized water reactors. The results show that the proposed method can support plant operators in timely cyber-attack response and effective risk assessment, reduce the risk, and improve the resilience of nuclear power plants to malicious cyber-attacks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085260171

Meanwhile, the cybersecurity of UAVs is gaining significant attention due to both financial and strategic information and value involved in aerial applications, and UAV and sensitive data collected by embedded sensors are subject to new security challenges and privacy issues. Traditional cryptographic techniques can be deployed to provide fundamental security services, however, they have been shown to be inefficient because of intrinsic resource constraints of UAVs and the open nature of wireless communication. For the sake of providing secure authentication between communication parties and further ensuring data security and privacy, this paper proposes a lightweight mutual authentication protocol, also referred to as PCAP, for secure communications between UAVs and ground station. The basic idea of the PCAP is that UAV and ground station use the challenge-response pair of physical unclonable function as the initial condition of chaotic system to randomly shuffle the message which piggybacks a seed to generate a secret session key. We conduct simulation experiments using OMNeT++to validate the effectiveness of the PCAP. The simulation results show that the PCAP can achieve better performance in terms of computation cost, communication overhead, and energy consumption of communication compared to prior cryptographic technique, indicating a viable approach for securing communications between UAVs and ground station. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091968306

Increasing interest is being given to the implementation of automotive cybersecurity systems. In this work we propose an efficient and high-performing intrusion detection system based on an unsupervised Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network, to identify attack messages sent on a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. The SOM network found a wide range of applications in intrusion detection because of its features of high detection rate, short training time, and high versatility. We propose to extend the SOM network to intrusion detection on in-vehicle CAN buses. Many hybrid approaches were proposed to combine the SOM network with other clustering methods, such as the k-means algorithm, in order to improve the accuracy of the model. We introduced a novel distance-based procedure to integrate the SOM network with the K-means algorithm and compared it with the traditional procedure. The models were tested on a car hacking dataset concerning traffic data messages sent on a CAN bus, characterized by a large volume of traffic with a low number of features and highly imbalanced data distribution. The experimentation showed that the proposed method greatly improved detection accuracy over the traditional approach. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088826401

Instead, there is at present a need to reassess the value of language as both analytical topic and academic practice; not as alternative, but additive to new insights and conversations.

Such behavior destroys the idea of information exchange. On the other hand, governments are forcing specific entities and operators to report them specific incidents depending on their impact, otherwise there could be sanctions to those operators which are not reporting them on time. Obligations and sanctions are usually discouraging participants to share information voluntarily which will just share and report what is strictly required. We propose a paradigm shift of cybersecurity information exchange by introducing a new way to encourage all participants involved, at all levels, to share relevant information dynamically. It will also contribute to the support and deployment of Dynamic Risk Management frameworks to keep risks under an acceptance level along the time. Participants will have new and specific incentives to share, invest and consume threat intelligence and risk intelligence information depending on their different roles (producers, consumers, investors, donors and owner).

For instance, unauthorized access, such as cyber-attacks, to a smart home system could cause danger by controlling sensors and actuators, opening the doors for a thief. This paper applies an extra layer of security of multi-factor authentication to act as a prevention method for mitigating unauthorized access. One of those factors is face recognition, as it has recently become popular due to its non-invasive biometric techniques, which is easy to use with cameras attached to most trending computers and smartphones. In this paper, the gaps in existing IoT smart home systems have been analyzed, and we have suggested improvements for overcoming them by including necessary system modules and enhancing user registration and log-in authentication. We propose software architecture for implementing such a system. To the best of our knowledge, the existing IoT smart home management research does not support face recognition and liveness detection within the authentication operation of their suggested software architectures. © Science and Information Organization.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081208747

In recent times, actors have engaged in acts of information warfare ranging from attempts to compromising voting systems, to spreading false propaganda and even direct attacks on public infrastructure via information systems. Initial analysis points to the fact that most of these attempts have been successful in achieving their intended objectives. Given this reality, we expect them to intensify and be more creative in the future. In this paper we draw on a critical analysis of the role of information systems in creating political disruption to propose that information systems can be ‘weaponized’ by compromising their goals and values even while they remain protected. Building on this proposition we develop a risk-based Actor, Lever, Effects and Response Taxonomy (ALERT) to assist security practitioners and policymakers to analyze and respond to attacks enabled by information systems aimed at political disruption. We illustrate the utility of ALERT using representative examples of weaponized attacks from credible news sources. Finally, we leverage the insights gained from ALERT to propose a theoretical framework where we assert that over time as actors gain maturity and experience using levers to disrupt political systems, so too does the public sector gain experience in response thus building their response capacity. This dynamic relationship increasingly pushes both actors and defenders to come up with more innovative, agile and sophisticated methods to weaponize and respond to information systems enabled attacks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072576558

A smart city utilizes IoT-enabled technologies, communications and applications to maximize operational efficiency and enhance both the service providers’ quality of services and people’s wellbeing and quality of life. With the growth of smart city networks, however, comes the increased risk of cybersecurity threats and attacks. IoT devices within a smart city network are connected to sensors linked to large cloud servers and are exposed to malicious attacks and threats. Thus, it is important to devise approaches to prevent such attacks and protect IoT devices from failure. In this paper, we explore an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, DT, RF, ANN and KNN) to defend against and mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Contrary to existing works that have focused on single classifiers, we also explore ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and stacking to enhance the performance of the detection system. Additionally, we consider an integration of feature selection, cross-validation and multi-class classification for the discussed domain, which has not been well considered in the existing literature. Experimental results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify cyberattacks and the stacking ensemble model outperforms comparable models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, implying the promise of stacking in this domain. © 2020 by the authors.

Previous literature in the field was gathered and analyzed using a categorization method to identify factors that are essential to the successful adoption of AVs. A total of 14 factors. These factors were identified from 85 articles published in various journals such as: transportation research part A: policy and practice, rand corporation, yale journal of law and technology in the literature, which could be sorted into four readiness categories: technology (vehicle technology, safety and ethics), infrastructure (communication, technology of roads and traffic signs and cost of infrastructure), legal (liability, privacy and cybersecurity) and user acceptance (consumer acceptance, marketing and advertising, cost of AVs and trust). Stakeholders will need to work on these four areas to ensure successful mass adoption of AVs and decrease the chance of failure.

Security of code and privacy of data must be implemented in both design and programming practice to face such scenarios. In such a context, this paper proposes a software development approach, Privacy Oriented Software Development (POSD), that complements traditional development processes by integrating the activities needed for addressing security and privacy management in software systems. The approach is based on 5 key elements (Privacy by Design, Privacy Design Strategies, Privacy Pattern, Vulnerabilities, Context). The approach can be applied in two directions forward and backward, for developing new software systems or re-engineering an existing one. This paper presents the POSD approach in the backward mode together with an application in the context of an industrial project. Results show that POSD is able to discover software vulnerabilities, identify the remediation patterns needed for addressing them in the source code, and design the target architecture to be used for guiding privacy-oriented system re-engineering. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088594511

Instead of following the traditional infrastructure expansion policy, current transportation research focuses on developing innovative and novel solutions to the aforementioned issues. Current pathways to overcoming these issues include the gradual transition toward a number of emerging transportation technologies, such as, autonomous motor vehicles for human transport, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) and “drone” technologies for surveillance, and package deliveries. However, as a long-term solution, transportation scientists are also investigating the once-seemingly futuristic notion of flying car technology—a convergent form of ground/air vehicle transportation, and assessing associated regulations. In this paper, an extensive review of current literature is conducted to explore the technological capabilities of flying cars—each requiring appropriate regulations and governance—to become fully sustainable. Specifically, issues pertinent to training, safety, environment, navigation, infrastructure, logistics/sustainability, and cybersecurity and human factors are explored. This paper concludes with a preliminary quantitative analysis exploring the public perceptions associated with flying cars—including anticipated benefits, concerns, and willingness to both hire and acquire the technology once available to consumers.

To encourage individuals to engage in and learn about secure behaviors, ISec research has turned to fear appeals, which are short messages that communicate threats and efficacy to elicit protection motivation among recipients. ISec research has reported contradictory findings on what makes fear appeals effective in ISec contexts, and this lack of clarity is problematic, because it may lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, some studies have argued that the mixed findings arise from differences between personal and organizational contexts and that fear appeals do not work well among organizational users. However, this argument has not been empirically tested, and differences in message design provide an equally plausible explanation, which has also not been tested. To reconcile the mixed findings across these studies, we test the effects of context (i.e., personal users vs. organizational users) and degree of message abstractness (i.e., abstract vs. concrete) on fear-appeal outcomes. We draw from construal-level theory to conceptualize the differences between abstract and concrete fear appeals. Across three experiments, we find evidence that concrete fear appeals are more effective than abstract fear appeals for the purpose of stimulating fear-appeal outcomes. Furthermore, by comparing two identical experiments—one conducted with personal users and another conducted with organizational users—we find differences in participants’ responses to fear appeals. However, contrary to our expectations, our findings suggest that organizational users report higher levels of fear and protection motivation than personal users. This finding is not a theoretical contradiction: the theoretical crux of an effective fear appeal is that it must be personally relevant to stimulate fear; correspondingly, we show that concrete fear appeals help stimulate fear and the desired protective response. Moreover, concrete fear appeals increase actual compliance behaviors, not just intentions. Thus, our findings suggest that the mixed findings in the literature may be a product of message abstractness and differences among audiences. This has pivotal implications for how to construct fear appeals in research and practice. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090549475

Recently, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is considered as a pivotal element in network security infrastructures to achieve solid line of protection against cyberattacks. The prime challenges presented to IDS are curse of high dimensionality and class imbalance that tends to increase the detection time and degrade the efficiency of IDS. As a result, feature selection plays an important role in enabling to identify the most significant features for intrusion detection. Although, several feature evaluation measures are being proposed for feature selection in literature, there is no consensus on which measures are best for intrusion detection. Therein, this work aims at recommending the most appropriate feature evaluation measure for building an efficient IDS. In this direction, four filter-based feature evaluation measures that stem from different theories such as Consistency, Correlation, Information and Distance are investigated for their potential implications in enhancing the detection ability of IDS model for different classes of attacks. Along with this, the influence of the selected features on classification accuracy of an IDS model is analyzed using four different categories of classifiers namely, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN). Finally, a two-step statistical significance test is conducted on the experimental results to determine which feature evaluation measure contributes statistically significant difference in IDS performance. All the experimental comparisons are performed on two benchmark intrusion detection datasets, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. In these experiments, consistency measure has best influenced the IDS model in improving the detection ability with regard to detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR), kappa statistics (KS) and identifying the most significant features for intrusion detection. Also, from the analysis results, it is revealed that RF is the ideal classifier to be used in conjunction with any of these four feature evaluation measures to achieve better detection accuracy than others. From the statistical results, we recommend the use of consistency measure for designing an efficient IDS in terms of DR and FAR. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087702739

However, there is a lack of experience with security concerns in context of safety engineering in general and in automotive safety departments in particular. To address this problem, we propose a systematic pattern-based approach that interlinks safety and security patterns and provides guidance with respect to selection and combination of both types of patterns in context of system engineering. A combined safety and security pattern engineering workflow is proposed to provide systematic guidance to support non-expert engineers based on best practices.

In this work, cyberattacks were modeled using an extension of the well-known Petri net formalism. That formalism, designated Petri nets with players, strategies, and costs, models the states of the cyberattack and events during the attack as markings and transition firings in the net respectively. The formalism models the attacker and defender as competing players who may observe the marking of a subset of the net and based on the observed marking act by changing the stochastic firing rates of a subset of the transitions in order to achieve their competing goals. Rate changes by the players incur a cost. Using the formalism, nets were constructed to model specific cyberattack patterns (cross-site scripting and spear phishing) documented in the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification database. The models were validated by a panel of cybersecurity experts in a structured face validation process. Given those validated nets, a reinforcement learning algorithm using an -Greedy policy was implemented and set to the task of learning which actions to take, i.e., which transition rates to change for the different observable markings, so as to accomplish the goals of the attacker or defender. Experiments were conducted with a dynamic (learning) attacker against a static (fixed) defender, a static attacker against a dynamic defender, and a dynamic attacker against a dynamic defender. In all cases, the reinforcement learning algorithm was able to improve its performance, in terms of achieving the player's objective and reducing the cost of doing so, over time. These results demonstrate the potential of formally modeling cyberattacks and of applying reinforcement learning to improving cybersecurity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079088937

However, there is limited research examining the potential for VR to enable improved communication for people with communication disability.Aims: To review: (a) current research using VR in speech-language pathology; and (b) the ethical and safety considerations of VR research, to inform an agenda for future research applying VR in the field of speech-language pathology.Main contribution: This review reveals that there is an emergent body of literature applying VR to improve or develop physical, psychological and communication interventions. Use of non-immersive virtual environments to provide speech-language pathology assessment or intervention for people with communication disability has demonstrated positive outcomes, with emerging evidence of the transfer of functional communication skills from virtual to real-world environments. However, the use of VR technology and immersive virtual environments in communication disability practice and research introduces safety and ethical issues that must be carefully considered.Conclusions: Research employing VR is in its infancy in the field of speech-language pathology. Early evidence from other healthcare disciplines suggests that VR is an engaging means of delivering immersive and interactive training to build functional skills that can be generalized to the real world. While the introduction of new technology requires careful consideration of research ethics and patient safety, future VR communication research could proceed safely with adequate engagement of interdisciplinary teams and technology specialists.Implications for rehabilitationImmersive virtual reality may be used in rehabilitation to simulate natural environments to practice and develop communication skills.The sense of immersion that can be achieved using virtual reality may promote the generalization of skills learnt during clinical rehabilitation to real-world situations.Ethical and safety considerations, including cybersecurity and cybersickness, must be carefully monitored during all virtual reality research.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075005879

Also, enabled by technological advancements and electronics miniaturization, wearable health device (WHD) applications are expected to grow exponentially. This, in turn, may make 4P medicine (predictive, precise, preventive and personalized) a more attainable goal within dialysis patient care. This article discusses different use cases where WHD could be of relevance for dialysis patient care, i.e. measurement of heart rate, arrhythmia detection, blood pressure, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and physical activity. After adequate validation of the different WHD in this specific population, data obtained from WHD could form part of a body area network (BAN), which could serve different purposes such as feedback on actionable parameters like physical inactivity, fluid overload, danger signalling or event prediction. For a BAN to become clinical reality, not only must technical issues, cybersecurity and data privacy be addressed, but also adequate models based on artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis need to be developed for signal optimization, data representation, data reliability labelling and interpretation. Moreover, the potential of WHD and BAN can only be fulfilled if they are part of a transformative healthcare system with a shared responsibility between patients, healthcare providers and the payors, using a step-up approach that may include digital assistants and dedicated 'digital clinics'. The coming decade will be critical in observing how these developments will impact and transform dialysis patient care and will undoubtedly ask for an increased 'digital literacy' for all those implicated in their care. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

We find that only cyber incidents are associated with increases in audit fees and that the association is driven by more severe incidents. We also find that increases in audit fees are smaller for firms with prior cybersecurity risk disclosure after 2011 when the SEC issued cybersecurity disclosure guidance.

In the IoT landscape, the publish/subscribe-based Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is popular. Cyber security threats against the MQTT protocol are anticipated to increase at par with its increasing use by IoT manufacturers. In particular, IoT is vulnerable to protocol-based Application layer Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which have been known to cause widespread service disruption in legacy systems. In this paper, we propose an Application layer DoS attack detection framework for the MQTT protocol and test the scheme on legitimate and protocol compliant DoS attack scenarios. To protect the MQTT message brokers from such attacks, we propose a machine learning-based detection framework developed for the MQTT protocol. Through experiments, we demonstrate the impact of such attacks on various MQTT brokers and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework to detect these malicious attacks. The results obtained indicate that the attackers can overwhelm the server resources even when legitimate access was denied to MQTT brokers and resources have been restricted. In addition, the MQTT features we have identified showed high attack detection accuracy. The field size and length-based features drastically reduced the false-positive rates and are suitable in detecting IoT based attacks. © 2020 The Author(s).

It is thus becoming particularly necessary to identify cyber-attacks or irregularities in the system and develop an efficient intrusion detection framework that is integral to security. Researchers have worked on developing intrusion detection models that depend on machine learning (ML) methods to address these security problems. An intelligent intrusion detection device powered by data can exploit artificial intelligence (AI), and especially ML, techniques. Accordingly, we propose in this article an intrusion detection model based on a Real-Time Sequential Deep Extreme Learning Machine Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System (RTS-DELM-CSIDS) security model. The proposed model initially determines the rating of security aspects contributing to their significance and then develops a comprehensive intrusion detection framework focused on the essential characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of our proposed RTS-DELM-CSIDS framework by performing dataset evaluations and calculating accuracy parameters to validate. The experimental findings demonstrate that the RTS-DELM-CSIDS framework outperforms conventional algorithms.

This results in increased ship vulnerability to cyber-attacks, which may lead to financial loss, environmental pollution, safety accidents. The aim of this study is to propose a novel method for cybersecurity risk assessment of ship systems. In this novel method, the Cyber-Preliminary Hazard Analysis method steps are enriched with new steps supporting the identification of cyber-attack scenarios and the risk assessment implementation. The proposed method is applied for the cyber-risk assessment and design enhancement of the navigation and propulsion systems of an inland waterways autonomous vessel. The results demonstrate that several critical scenarios can arise on the investigated autonomous vessel due to known vulnerabilities.

To help curb this problem, we propose the novel notion of a responsible Internet, which provides higher degrees of trust and sovereignty for critical service providers (e.g., power grids) and all kinds of other users by improving the transparency, accountability, and controllability of the Internet at the network-level. A responsible Internet accomplishes this through two new distributed and decentralized systems. The first is the Network Inspection Plane (NIP), which enables users to request measurement-based descriptions of the chains of network operators (e.g., ISPs and DNS and cloud providers) that handle their data flows or could potentially handle them, including the relationships between them and the properties of these operators. The second is the Network Control Plane (NCP), which allows users to specify how they expect the Internet infrastructure to handle their data (e.g., in terms of the security attributes that they expect chains of network operators to have) based on the insights they gained from the NIP. We discuss research directions and starting points to realize a responsible Internet by combining three currently largely disjoint research areas: large-scale measurements (for the NIP), open source-based programmable networks (for the NCP), and policy making (POL) based on the NIP and driving the NCP. We believe that a responsible Internet is the next stage in the evolution of the Internet and that the concept is useful for clean slate Internet systems as well. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090453794

In this paper, we present a novel anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS), called ARIES (smArt gRid Intrusion dEtection System), which is capable of protecting efficiently SG communications. ARIES combines three detection layers that are devoted to recognising possible cyberattacks and anomalies against (a) network flows, (b) Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets and (c) operational data. Each detection layer relies on a Machine Learning (ML) model trained using data originating from a power plant. In particular, the first layer (network flow-based detection) performs a supervised multiclass classification, recognising Denial of Service (DoS), brute force attacks, port scanning attacks and bots. The second layer (packet-based detection) detects possible anomalies related to the Modbus packets, while the third layer (operational data based detection) monitors and identifies anomalies upon operational data (i.e., time series electricity measurements). By emphasising on the third layer, the ARIES Generative Adversarial Network (ARIES GAN) with novel error minimisation functions was developed, considering mainly the reconstruction difference. Moreover, a novel reformed conditional input was suggested, consisting of random noise and the signal features at any given time instance. Based on the evaluation analysis, the proposed GAN network overcomes the efficacy of conventional ML methods in terms of Accuracy and the F1 score. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite decades of studies and experiences on this issue, there still exists a problem that we always pay great attention to technology while overlooking strategy. In the traditional warfare, the level of decision-making and the formulation of optimal strategies have a great effect on the warfare result. Similarly, the timeliness and quality of decision-making in cyber attack-defense also make great significance. Since the attackers and defenders are oppositional, the selection of optimal defense strategy with the maximum payoff is difficult. To solve this problem, the stochastic evolutionary game model is utilized to simulate the dynamic adversary of cyber attack-defense. We add the parameter \lambda to the Logit Quantal Response Dynamics (LQRD) equation to quantify the cognitive differences of real-world players. By calculating the evolutionary stable equilibrium, the best decision-making approach is proposed, which makes a balance between defense cost and benefit. Cases studies on ransomware indicate that the proposed approach can help the defender predict possible attack action, select the related optimal defense strategy over time, and gain the maximum defense payoff. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085763728

In this paper, we study the cybersecurity issue of shortterm wind power forecasting. We present one class of data attacks, called false data injection attacks, against wind power deterministic and probabilistic forecasting. We show that any malicious data can be injected to historical data without being discovered by one of the commonlyâused anomaly detection techniques. Moreover, we testify that attackers can launch such data attacks even with limited resources. To study the impact of data attacks on the forecasting accuracy, we establish the framework of simulating false data injection attacks using the Monte Carlo method. Then, the robustness of six representative wind power forecasting models is tested. Numerical results on realworld data demonstrate that the support vector machine and kânearest neighbors combined with kernel density estimator are the most robust deterministic and probabilistic forecasting ones among six representative models, respectively. Nevertheless, none of them can issue accurate forecasts under very strong false data attacks. This presents a serious challenge to the community of wind power forecasting.

The outward manifestations of change are the emergence of the connected vehicle as the norm rather than the province of up-market cars competing on the presence of innovative ICT-driven features, the race to develop fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the switch to more environmentally sustainable alternative fuel vehicles. The main enabler of these fundamental developments is technological change. But technology is also a driver of change, this is nowhere more obvious than in the application of ICTs in the transport arena. But technological changes of this magnitude also lead to changes in industry structure, a shift in the basis of competition from features and performance to functionalities, and a growing reliance on knowledge that is new to the traditional industry. This paper addresses one aspect of this milieu of developments, that is the emergence of cybersecurity threats to the modern highly-computerised vehicle. Countering such problems requires a high degree of knowledge sharing in the industry and particularly between car manufacturers and their supply networks. This article collects, synthesises and analyses some primary evidence from cybersecurity experts in the industry. The overall conclusion reached is that, in the view of auto-cybersecurity specialists, the level of knowledge-sharing is inadequate. The article presents a number of potential explanations for this phenomenon; the common feature of these explanations is the existence of significant tensions and lack of trust in the knowledge environment. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085163073

One of the biggest drivers for successful adoption of these models is how well domain experts and users are able to understand and trust their functionality. As these black-box models are being employed to make important predictions, the demand for transparency and explainability is increasing from the stakeholders.Explanations supporting the output of ML models are crucial in cyber security, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary output for their analysis. Recent approaches in the literature have focused on three different areas: (a) creating and improving explainability methods which help users better understand the internal workings of ML models and their outputs; (b) attacks on interpreters in white box setting; (c) defining the exact properties and metrics of the explanations generated by models. However, they have not covered, the security properties and threat models relevant to cybersecurity domain, and attacks on explainable models in black box settings.In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a taxonomy for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, covering various security properties and threat models relevant to cyber security domain. We design a novel black box attack for analyzing the consistency, correctness and confidence security properties of gradient based XAI methods. We validate our proposed system on 3 security-relevant data-sets and models, and demonstrate that the method achieves attacker's goal of misleading both the classifier and explanation report and, only explainability method without affecting the classifier output. Our evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results and can help in designing secure and robust XAI methods. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093853411

This study is built in a joint framework, where two different attack strategies are applied to the integrated systems: (1) disruptions to facilities with most links and (2) disruptions to the most important facilities in terms of flow. The vulnerability is measured after each network attack by quantifying the unmet load (UL) through a power flow analysis and calculating the topological damage of the systems with the geodesic vulnerability (v¯) index. The proposed simulation framework is applied to a case study that consists of the IEEE 118-bus test system and a 25-node high-pressure natural gas network, where both are coupled through seven gas-fired power plants (GFPPs) and three electric compressors (ECs).

In this article, we propose a deep learning architecture, PyNDA, to extract psychometric dimensions from user-generated texts. PyNDA contains a novel representation embedding, a demographic embedding, a structural equation model (SEM) encoder, and a multitask learning mechanism designed to work in unison to address the unique challenges associated with extracting rich, sophisticated, and user-centric psychometric dimensions. Our experiments on three real-world datasets encompassing 11 psychometric dimensions, including trust, anxiety, and literacy, show that PyNDA markedly outperforms traditional feature-based classifiers as well as the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Ablation analysis reveals that each component of PyNDA significantly contributes to its overall performance.

It implies that ~620 million people are living without electricity in SSA. Going with the 2030 vision of the United Nations that electricity should be accessible to all, it is important that new technology and methods are provided. In comparison to other nations worldwide, smart grid (SG) is an emerging technology in SSA. SG is an information technology-enhanced power grid, which provides a two-way communication network between energy producers and customers. Also, it includes renewable energy, smart meters, and smart devices that help to manage energy demands and reduce energy generation costs. However, SG is facing inherent difficulties, such as energy theft, lack of trust, security, and privacy issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized energy system (BDES) to accelerate rural and urban electrification by improving service delivery while minimizing the cost of generation and addressing historical antipathy and cybersecurity risk within SSA. Additionally, energy insufficiency and fixed pricing schemes may raise concerns in SG, such as the imbalance of order. The paper also introduces a blockchain-based energy trading system, which includes price negotiation and incentive mechanisms to address the imbalance of order. Moreover, existing models for energy planning do not consider the effect of fill rate (FR) and service level (SL). A blockchain levelized cost of energy (BLCOE) is proposed as the least-cost solution that measures the impact of energy reliability on generation cost using FR and SL. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed model and the least-cost option varies with relative energy generation cost of centralized, decentralized and BDES infrastructure. Case studies of Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Liberia, Mali, and Senegal illustrate situations that are more suitable for BDES. For other SSA countries, BDES can cost-effectively service a large population and regions. Additionally, BLCOE reduces energy costs by approximately 95% for battery and 75% for the solar modules. The future BLCOE varies across SSA on an average of about 0.049 $/kWh as compared to 0.15 $/kWh of an existing system in the literature. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080961031

Accordingly, the monitoring of computers and networks is too complicated for network administrators. Hence, network security represents one of the biggest serious challenges that can be faced by network security communities. Taking into consideration the fact that e-banking, e-commerce, and business data will be shared on the computer network, these data may face a threat from intrusion. The purpose of this research is to propose a methodology that will lead to a high level and sustainable protection against cyberattacks. In particular, an adaptive anomaly detection framework model was developed using deep and machine learning algorithms to manage automatically-configured application-level firewalls. The standard network datasets were used to evaluate the proposed model which is designed for improving the cybersecurity system. The deep learning based on Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) and machine learning algorithms namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithms were implemented to classify the Denial-of-Service attack (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The information gain method was applied to select the relevant features from the network dataset. These network features were significant to improve the classification algorithm. The system was used to classify DoS and DDoS attacks in four stand datasets namely KDD cup 199, NSL-KDD, ISCX, and ICI-ID2017. The empirical results indicate that the deep learning based on the LSTM-RNN algorithm has obtained the highest accuracy. The proposed system based on the LSTM-RNN algorithm produced the highest testing accuracy rate of 99.51% and 99.91% with respectto KDD Cup'99, NSL-KDD, ISCX, and ICI-Id2017 datasets, respectively. A comparative result analysis between the machine learning algorithms, namely SVM and KNN, and the deep learning algorithms basedon the LSTM-RNN model is presented. Finally, it is concluded that the LSTM-RNN model is efficient and effective to improve the cybersecurity system for detecting anomaly-based cybersecurity. © 2020 Hasan Alkahtani et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098186282

An insightful aspect of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is its explicit recognition that the activities associated with managing cybersecurity risk are organization specific. The NIST Framework also recognizes that organizations should evaluate their cybersecurity risk management on a cost-benefit basis. The NIST Framework, however, does not provide guidance on how to carry out such a cost-benefit analysis. This article provides an approach for integrating cost-benefit analysis into the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Gordon-Loeb (GL) Model for cybersecurity investments is proposed as a basis for deriving a cost-effective level of spending on cybersecurity activities and for selecting the appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level. The analysis shows that the GL Model provides a logical approach to use when considering the cost-benefit aspects of cybersecurity investments during an organization's process of selecting the most appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level.

Thus, detecting such attacks early, i.e. during pre-encryption phase before the encryption takes place is necessary. Existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions use a fixed time-based thresholding approach to determine the pre-encryption phase boundaries. However, the fixed time thresholding approach implies that all samples start the encryption at the same time. Such assumption does not necessarily hold for all samples as the time for the main sabotage to start varies among different crypto-ransomware families due to the obfuscation techniques employed by the malware to change its attack strategies and evade detection, which generates different attack behaviors. Additionally, the lack of sufficient data at the early phases of the attack adversely affects the ability of feature extraction techniques in early detection models to perceive the characteristics of the attacks, which, consequently, decreases the detection accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a Dynamic Pre-encryption Boundary Delineation and Feature Extraction (DPBD-FE) scheme that determines the boundary of the pre-encryption phase, from which the features are extracted and selected more accurately. Unlike the fixed thresholding employed by the extant works, DPBD-FE tracks the pre-encryption phase for each instance individually based on the first occurrence of any cryptography-related APIs. Then, an annotated Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (aTF-IDF) technique was utilized to extract the features from runtime data generated during the pre-encryption phase of crypto-ransomware attacks. The aTF-IDF overcomes the challenge of insufficient attack patterns during the early phases of the attack lifecycle. The experimental evaluation shows that DPBD-FE was able to determine the pre-encryption boundaries and extract the features related to this phase more accurately compared to related works. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089495556

The proposed method, which works in a black-box way and covers some shortages of the existing adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, is simple to implement and only needs the output of the target classifiers to generate adversarial examples. To have a comprehensive evaluation of the attack performance of the proposed method, we use our method to generate adversarial examples against the common machine learning based security systems in cybersecurity including host intrusion detection systems, Android malware detection systems, and network intrusion detection systems. We compare the attack performance of the proposed method against these security systems with that of state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks.

The rapid development of IoT to most corners of life, however, leads to various emerging cybersecurity threats. Therefore, detecting and preventing potential attacks in IoT networks have recently attracted paramount interest from both academia and industry. Among various attack detection approaches, machine learning-based methods, especially deep learning, have demonstrated great potential thanks to their early detecting capability. However, these machine learning techniques only work well when a huge volume of data from IoT devices with label information can be collected. Nevertheless, the labeling process is usually time consuming and expensive, thus, it may not be able to adapt with quick evolving IoT attacks in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep transfer learning (DTL) method that allows to learn from data collected from multiple IoT devices in which not all of them are labeled. Specifically, we develop a DTL model based on two AutoEncoders (AEs). The first AE (AE1) is trained on the source datasets (source domains) in the supervised mode using the label information and the second AE (AE2) is trained on the target datasets (target domains) in an unsupervised manner without label information. The transfer learning process attempts to force the latent representation (the bottleneck layer) of AE2 similarly to the latent representation of AE1. After that, the latent representation of AE2 is used to detect attacks in the incoming samples in the target domain. We carry out intensive experiments on nine recent IoT datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DTL model significantly improves the accuracy in detecting IoT attacks compared to the baseline deep learning technique and two recent DTL approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086986266

In this paper, we present the capability of adopting artificial intelligence techniques in cybersecurity and present some of those intelligent-based approaches already in place in practice. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of AI-based approaches in cybersecurity as well as suggest some directions for research in the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079660595

Thus, intrusion detection is a key network security function in vehicles with open connectivity, such as self-driving and connected cars. Specifically, when a vehicle is connected to an external device through a smartphone inside the vehicle or when a vehicle communicates with external infrastructure, security technology is required to protect the software network inside the vehicle. Existing technology with this function includes vehicle gateways and intrusion detection systems. However, it is difficult to block malicious code based on application behaviors. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based data analysis method to accurately detect abnormal behaviors due to malware in large-scale network traffic in real time. First, we define a detection architecture, which is required by the intrusion detection module to detect and block malware attempting to affect the vehicle via a smartphone. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for detecting malicious behaviors in a network environment and conduct experiments to verify algorithm accuracy and cost through comparisons with other algorithms. © 2020 Seunghyun Park and Jin-Young Choi.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078682632

The world of cybersecurity is witness to numerous system break-ins for the purpose of gaining access. One of the ways to gain access to systems is fulfilled by authentication, the process where an entity verifies who he or she claims to be to access a system. With network traffic increasing day by day, the bots form a huge chunk of the network traffic. Over the last few years, bots have been trained to imitate human beings to gain access to computer based systems. Traditional authentication methods are based on what we know, who we are and what we have, and can be bypassed easily these days. Bots have been known to imitate human beings in order to gain access to systems by identifying captchas and picture based authentication systems. A bot gaining access to sensitive data may have severe repercussions. Thus there is a need to introduce certain parameters that could easily tell apart a bot and a human being. One of the primary factors that differentiates bots and human beings is the kind of psychology embedded in humans. In this paper, we identify a set of cyberpsychological factors that could differentiate human beings from bots. This may prove to be beneficial for the purpose of authentication where a human being may be able to authenticate himself/herself based on his/her psychology, whereas a bot may not be able to do the same because of the lack of its thinking capabilities. Therefore, the issue focuses on three important domains, that is, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and cyberpsychology. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075643398

We take a user-centred approach to design a visual analytics framework supporting the analysis of collections of users and the numerous sessions of activities they conduct within digital applications. The framework is centred around the concept of hierarchical user profiles that are built based on features derived from sessions, as well as on user tasks extracted using a topic modelling approach to summarise and stratify user behaviour. We externalise a series of analysis goals and tasks, and evaluate our methods through use cases conducted with experts. We observe that with the aid of interactive visual hierarchical user profiles, analysts are able to conduct exploratory and investigative analysis effectively, and able to understand the characteristics of user behaviour to make informed decisions whilst evaluating suspicious users and activities. © 2020 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075608847

In response, cybersecurity exercises, and in particular—cyber defence exercises (CDX) are becoming ever more popular. They provide a training platform to simulate real-life situations. CDX are significant events involving months of preparation, and previous studies show a lack of objective evidence of their relevance regarding the learning impact. Skills of exercise participants are usually different and vary from tech-savvy to beginners. Also, trainees are diverse when considering their background, current work profile (position and institution), and experience. Assessment of their competencies is essential to ensure quality in training. The complexity and multi-dimensionality of the usual CDX make it challenging. Additionally, the costly event usually focuses on just a subset of participants, and non-technical members of an organisation are not included. The goal of our research is to provide a proper methodology to optimise the exercises so that every team and each participant, including a non-technical trainee, are adequately evaluated and trained using the allocated resources most effectively. This paper presents a framework to aid in the development and assessment of cybersecurity competences of all teams during hybrid CDX. The framework aims towards raised cybersecurity awareness—a state when every user of digital technologies understands the associated risks. The framework consists of a sequence of steps including stages of formative assessment, team construction, determination of objectives for different types of teams, and the exercise flow. It complements standard methodologies for cybersecurity training programs. The framework was developed based on data collected using questionnaires, interviews, and direct observation in a case study carried out during international cybersecurity exercises. The framework would help organise hybrid exercises for a diverse community of trainees, including non-technical members of an organisation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072194937

While there is overlap between these communities, there are also stark differences. Academic researchers can often rely on research ethics boards (REBs) to provide ethical oversight and governance which are typically unavailable to the practitioner community. However, we argue that even within the academic community the constitution of REBs is such that they may be (and in some cases at least are) unable to offer sound advice. Our recommendations are that ethics should be taught in far greater depth on computer science courses than is currently the case, and that codes of conduct should be developed and deployed provided they can be seen to be effective.

CRACK SDL allows for the declarative specification of the scenario elements and their interplay, e.g., a vulnerability affecting a system. Through a formal encoding of the properties of an SDL specification, CRACK also supports the automatic verification of a scenario against its training objectives. After a successful verification, the scenario is automatically deployed in the Cyber Range and automatically tested to check the correspondence between the behavior of the deployed system and its specification.

Background: Previous research suggests that older adults may be a vulnerable population to phishing attacks. Most research exploring age differences has used limiting designs, including retrospective self-report measures and restricted email sets. Method: The present studies explored how older and younger adults classify a diverse sample of 100 legitimate and phishing emails. In Experiment 1, participants rated the emails as either spam or not spam. Experiment 2 explored how framing would alter the results when participants rated emails as safe or not safe. In Experiment 3, participants performed the same task as Experiment 1, but were put under time pressure. Results: No age differences were observed in overall classification accuracy across the three experiments, rather all participants exhibited poor performance (20%–30% errors). Older adults took significantly longer to make classifications and were more liberal in classifying emails as spam or not safe. Time pressure seemed to remove this bias but did not influence overall accuracy. Conclusion: Older adults appear to be more cautious when classifying emails. However, being extra careful may come at the cost of classification speed and does not seem to improve accuracy. Application: Age demographics should be considered in the implementation of a cyber-training methodology. Younger adults may be less vigilant against cyber threats than initially predicted; older adults might be less prone to deception when given unlimited time to respond. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068267112

Although there are many different techniques allowing to get insights into models' inner workings, they often come with a trade off in the form of decreased accuracy. In the context of cybersecurity, where a single false negative can lead to a breach and compromise of the whole system, such a price is unacceptable. Therefore, there is a need for a solution which allows for the maximum possible model performance, and at the same time delivers human understandable interpretations.

The paper sets out policy options to facilitate a secure and trustworthy development of AI and considers health to be one of its most important areas of application. We illustrate that the European Commission's approach, as applied to medical AI, presents some challenges that can be detrimental if not addressed. In particular, we discuss the issues of European values and European data, the update problem of AI systems, and the challenges of new trade-offs such as privacy, cybersecurity, accuracy, and intellectual property rights. We also outline what we view as the most important next steps in the Commission's iterative process. Although the European Commission has done good work in setting out a European approach for AI, we conclude that this approach will be more difficult to implement in health care. It will require careful balancing of core values, detailed consideration of nuances of health and AI technologies, and a keen eye on the political winds and global competition. © 2020 The Author(s).

Most cybersecurity threats access internal networks through infected endpoints. Recently, various endpoint environments such as smartphones, tablets, and Internet of things (IoT) devices have been configured, and security issues caused by malware targeting them are intensifying. Event logs-based detection technology for endpoint security is detected using rules or patterns. Therefore, known attacks can respond, but unknown attacks can be difficult to respond to immediately. To solve this problem, in this paper, local outlier factor (LOF) and Autoencoder detect suspicious behavior that deviates from normal behavior. It also detects threats and shows the corresponding threats when suspicious events corresponding to the rules created through the attack profile are constantly occurring. Experimental results detected eight new suspicious processes that were not previously detected, and four malicious processes and one suspicious process were judged using Hybrid Analysis and VirusTotal. Based on the experiment results, it is expected that the use of operational policies such as allowlists in the proposed model will significantly improve performance by minimizing false positives. © 2020 by the authors.

One important factor linked to reducing human-instigated breaches of cybersecurity includes cyber hygiene. Cyber hygiene is the adaptive knowledge and behavior to mitigate risky online activities that put an individual's social, financial, and personal information at risk – a danger that is significantly compounded when discussing the risk to entire countries as opposed to a single individual. Interestingly, even though the human is the greatest risk to cybersecurity, very little research has examined the latent individual differences associated with developing cyber hygiene-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Thus, the goal of the present study was to address this gap in cyber hygiene research. The results from 173 university participants demonstrated that several factors, such as information handling, incident reporting, and password management were associated with better cyber hygiene. Individual differences such as trust in technology and intrinsic motivation were predictive of improved cyber hygiene – but were subject to significant sex differences. Differences across academic majors, such as science and technology majors, also emerged. Finally, we discuss the importance of understanding the role of human factors in modern cybersecurity and the potential practical implications associated with refining current course curricula in computer and information sciences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078988508

However, due to growing exposure to cyber-physical attacks, cybersecurity and resilience against the attacks have become significant concerns. Efforts have been made to improve cybersecurity in water CPSs, but only a few attempts to investigate resilience against cyber-physical attacks. This study contributes to characterizing the resilience of a water CPS and investigating potential resilience strategies. An advanced resilience measure that integrates the withstanding, absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capabilities of a system is proposed and applied to the C-town water distribution network (WDN) for 15 failure set scenarios during a pressure-driven hydraulic simulation. The results identify the failure sets and unfavorable operational conditions that make the system more vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks and, in turn, produce low resilience and capabilities. Additionally, after the recovery of a disrupted component, adjustment of overall operational interactions across system components is found to be needed for the complete restoration of disrupted functionality.

Additive manufacturing uses three dimensional digital design, software and hardware equipment to precisely deposit layered materials for on-demand product manufacturing. The distinct advantages in enabling additive manufacturing includes cost efficiency, reduced time-to-market, flexibility and precise customization. However, several challenges such as trusted traceability, certification for quality compliance, and protecting intellectual property need to be addressed. Blockchain-based distributed ledgers provide tremendous advantages for product traceability and ensure trust among participating stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for product traceability produced using additive manufacturing, guaranteeing secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, and data provenance among supply chain stakeholders. Our proposed solution utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to govern and trace transactions initiated by participants involved in the manufacturing process. Decentralized storage of Inter-Planetary File Systems is used to store and share design files, IoT device records, and additional product specifications. We provide the system architecture, implementation, and detailed algorithms that demonstrate the working principles of our proposed solution for secure AM.

The fundamental difference between the current bipolar rivalry and that during the Cold War is that ideology is no longer the main engine driving international competition, but rather the new digital dimension of strategic competition that is emerging between the United States and China. Technological advancement over the past 15 years has led world history's entry into the early digital age. The development of digital technology has created new ways of protecting national security, of accumulating national wealth, and of obtaining international support. Cybersecurity is becoming the core of national security and the share of digital economy in major powers' gross domestic product dramatically increases. For the leading powers, strategic competition in cyberspace in this early digital age outstrips to a crucial extent that within physical geographic boundaries. This article observes that Cold War mentality and digital mentality will have mixed impact on foreign policy-making in the digital age, and that interactions between the nations whose foreign policy is simultaneously influenced by both mentalities will shape the emerging international order into one of uneasy peace, where there is no direct war and few proxy wars. It will rather be a scenario reflecting the dark side of globalization and downside of global governance, evident in the violation of agreements, double dealing, cyber-attacks, and technology decoupling between states. Although further digital advancement will indeed change international politics in ever more aspects, US-China bipolar configuration will nevertheless remain in place for at least for two decades, or perhaps longer. © The Author(s) 2020.

They are equipped with extensive communication capabilities to perform dynamic monitoring, protection and control operations. Synchrophasors provide a pseudo real-time representation of grid's current state. Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) placed in different parts of the grid periodically collect synchrophasor data. Then, they send it to a Phasor Data Concentrator (PDCs) through Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS). The entire system formed as PMU Communication Network (PMU-CN) is based on two available frameworks: IEEE C37.118.2 and IEC 61850-90-5. As New York Blackout of 2003 showed that accurate and timely delivery of phasor measurements is vital for secure grid operation. Attacks on PMU-CN may lead to several consequences in the grid and cause physical damage. IEEE C37.118.2 does not specify any security mechanism to mitigate security attacks. To address this gap, security mechanism specified in IEC 61850-90-5 have been implemented using OpenSSL library. A novel toolbox called R-GoSV has been developed to construct PMU messages with cybersecurity mechanisms. Thanks to this tool, custom messages have been transmitted in the network to investigate their effectiveness.

BACCER's efficacy to model examples of tree-structures and other models is demonstrated herein. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098497913

An intrusion detection system (IDS) shall be introduced to protect the networks from various attacks. Even with the increased amount of works in the IDS research, there is a lack of studies that analyze the available IDS datasets. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the relevance of the features in the KDD99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Three methods were employed: a rough-set theory (RST), a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and a discrete variant of the cuttlefish algorithm (D-CFA). First, the dependency ratio between the features and the classes was calculated, using the RST. Second, each feature in the datasets became an input for the BPNN, to measure their ability for a classification task concerning each class. Third, a feature-selection process was carried out over multiple runs, to indicate the frequency of the selection of each feature. From the result, it indicated that some features in the KDD99 dataset could be used to achieve a classification accuracy above 84%. Moreover, a few features in both datasets were found to give a high contribution to increasing the classification’s performance. These features were present in a combination of features that resulted in high accuracy; the features were also frequently selected during the feature selection process. The findings of this study are anticipated to help the cybersecurity academics in creating a lightweight and accurate IDS model with a smaller number of features for the developing technologies. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper examined which psychological and socio-demographic characteristics predicted cyberscam victimhood, in general, and across individual cyberscams (including, consumer, charity, investment, and romance scams). In line with the hypotheses, more impulsive and neurotic individuals were more likely to be scammed by cyberscams, in general. Contrary to the hypotheses, those who scored high on internal locus of control, men, and educated people were more likely to be tricked by cyberscams, in general. Some important differences between the types of cyberscams were also identified. Investment scam victims were more likely to be older, men, and score higher on internal locus of control compared with the other cyberscam victims. Consumer scam victims, in contrast to other scam victims, were more likely to be women and were less educated. The work here suggests that there is merit in systematically characterizing different types of cyberfrauds and examining, in detail, a typology of cyberscam victims by scam type.

Accused states uniformly deny the accusation or decline to comment, without changing behaviour. For international lawyers, the problem is compounded by the absence of international law in these charges. States are not invoking international law when they complain of other states' behaviour, suggesting the law is weak - or worse, irrelevant - in holding states accountable for their cyber operations. In lieu of 'naming and shaming', we introduce and examine the broader concept of 'accusation' as a social, political and legal practice with diverse uses in cyberspace and beyond. Accusers must make strategic choices about how they frame their accusations, and we unpack various elements accusers may manipulate to their advantage. Accusations also have many purposes. They may seek to 'name and shame' an accused into conforming to certain behavioural expectations, but they may also aim at defensive or deterrent effects on both the accused and, crucially, on third parties. Particularly important, accusations may play a constitutive role, constructing new norms, including customary international law, within the international community.

However, the measurement samples inside the substations, or in phasor data concentrators (PDCs) can become a target for cyber-attacks, such as false data injection and data tampering attacks. Moreover, the synchrophasors are vulnerable to a single point of failure. Blockchain, the main technology behind the bitcoin, can simultaneously ensure reliability, security, and integrity with decentralization properties in a peer-to-peer system. Therefore, to mitigate the issues in the synchrophasor network, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based synchrophasor network protection framework to enhance the self-defensive capability of its monitoring system. Our proposed model can mitigate data manipulation attacks from malicious entities by introducing bloom filter based fast phasor data identity validation, and Merkle tree-based fast data verification. Finally, the blockchain consensus can help to keep the consistency in the system and eliminate malicious entities from manipulating the overall security of the protection framework.

However, since NS is a result of the recent advancement in Software-Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization, it introduces new security issues which include attacks against an NS instance within an operator network and interslice security threats. In this scenario, identifying and mitigating attacks in real-time is of paramount importance to improve security aspects. However, it is far from being straightforward. Therefore, this work proposes the FrameRTP4, a P4-based framework that aims to deliver real-time attack detection and mitigation mechanisms in 5G NS scenarios. For this, it provides a P4-based switch that implements an Service Function Chaining protocol layer, an efficient and scalable Access Control List for the detection and mitigation of known attacks, and a monitoring system aiming to reduce the overhead induced on the control channel. Furthermore, it delivers an orchestrator that aims to control all switches in order to enable lifecycle management of NS instances and P4 table rules. Besides, it also performs some autonomous tasks such as the wildcard rules generation and the detection of new threats by using machine learning algorithms.

They have less experience in dealing with the Internet-enabled device and hence less experience in handling security threats like malware as compared to users of other countries who have gone through the learning curve of handling such security threats using other Internet-enabled devices such as laptop and desktop. Because of this, the inexperienced Indian smartphone user may be vulnerable to Internet-related security breaches, as compared to the citizens of developed economies. Hence, it is essential to understand the attitude, behaviour and security practices of smartphone users in India. Limited research is available about the security behaviour of smartphone users in India as the majority of research in this domain is done outside India. Design/methodology/approach: In this empirical study, the researchers identified 28 cybersecurity behaviours and practices through a survey of relevant literature. An online survey of identified cybersecurity behaviours and practices was administered to 300 smartphone users. Frequency analysis of the respondent data was done to understand the adoption of recommended cybersecurity behaviours and practices. Pearson’s chi-square with 5% level of significance has been used to test the hypotheses. Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction was conducted for statistically significant associations. Findings: Overall, the respondents did not exhibit good cybersecurity behaviour. Respondents have adopted some of the most popular security features of the smartphone such as the use of screen lock. However, respondents have not adopted or are not aware of the technical security controls such as encryption and remote wipe. Statistically significant differences were found between the cybersecurity behaviour and practices and independent variables such as gender, age, mobile operating system (OS) and mother tongue. Respondents reported high level of motivation to protect their device and data, whereas they reported moderate level of threat awareness and the ability to protect to their device and data. Results of the comparative analysis with a similar study in China and the USA are also reported in this study. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this study are as follows: the respondents' perceptions about their cybersecurity behaviours and practices were measured as opposed to their actual behaviours and practices and the generalizability of the study is limited because the sample size is small as compared to the total number of smartphone users in India. Practical implications: The findings of this study may be useful for the design of effective cybersecurity prevention and intervention programs for general smartphone users of India. Originality/value: This study provides an insight about cybersecurity behaviour of smartphone users in India. To the knowledge of the researchers, this is the first study to collect such quantitative data of smartphone users in India for a better understanding of the cybersecurity behaviours and practices. This study identified 28 cybersecurity behaviours and practices, which smartphone users should follow to improve cybersecurity. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078297266

Using a survey, data for the independent variables of the study was collected from 68 branch offices (with 536 employees in total) of a law enforcement agency in South Korea. Separately, for WISE, we obtained the branch offices’ annual security assessment scores from the organization. The results reveal the cross-level nature of WISE, suggesting that group mechanisms significantly mediate the relationship between individual self-efficacy and WISE. The results support the view that group mechanisms are important in ISec management and need to be considered alongside the individual-level analysis in the pursuit of workgroup ISec performance.

The tool allows for detecting IoT device vulnerabilities that are related to two common cybersecurity problems in IoT: the implementation of weak security mechanisms and the lack of a proper security configuration.

The purpose of this paper is to provide SMEs with a tailored maturity model enabling them to capture and improve their information security capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: Design Science Research was followed to design and evaluate the method as a design artifact. Findings: The method has successfully been used to adapt the ISFAM model to a group of SMEs within a regional cluster resulting in a model that is aligned with the OCs of the cluster. Areas for further investigation and improvements were identified. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on applying the proposed method for the SMEs active in the transport, logistics and packaging sector in the Port of Rotterdam. Future research can focus on different sectors and regions. The method can be used for adapting other focus area maturity models. Practical implications: The resulting adapted maturity model can facilitate the creation and further development of a base of common or shared knowledge in the cluster. The adapted maturity model can cut the cost of over implementation of information security capabilities for the SMEs with scarce resources. Originality/value: The resulting adapted maturity model can facilitate the creation and further development of a base of common or shared knowledge in the cluster.

To prevent more data breaches to intellectual capital, organizations must provide regular cybersecurity awareness training for all personnel. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of different evidence-based cybersecurity training methods on employees’ cybersecurity risk perception and self-reported behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The study participants were randomly assigned into four groups (i.e. malware report, malware videos, both malware report and malware videos and no interventions) to assess the effects of cybersecurity training on their perceptions of vulnerability, severity, self-efficacy, security intention as well as their self-reported cybersecurity behaviors. Findings: The results show that evidence-based malware report is a relatively better training method in affecting employees’ intentions of engaging in recommended cybersecurity behaviors comparing with the other training methods used in this study. A closer analysis suggests whether the training method contains self-relevant information could make a difference to the training effects.

However, past research revealed that the level of awareness among Internet users is still low or moderate. One of the vital measures to be taken is to cultivate knowledge and awareness among Internet users from their early age, i.e., young children. Young children specifically, need to be educated to operate in a safe manner in cyberspace and to protect themselves in the process.

Normal and attack patterns shift as new protocols and applications are introduced, further compounded by burstiness and seasonal variation. Accordingly, it is difficult to apply machine learning-based techniques and defences in practice. Reinforcement learning (RL) may overcome this detection problem for DDoS attacks by managing and monitoring consequences; an agent's role is to learn to optimise performance criteria (which are always available) in an online manner. We advance the state-of-the-art in RL-based DDoS mitigation by introducing two agent classes designed to act on a per-flow basis, in a protocol-agnostic manner for any network topology. This is supported by an in-depth investigation of feature suitability and empirical evaluation. Our results show the existence of flow features with high predictive power for different traffic classes, when used as a basis for feedback-loop-like control. We show that the new RL agent models can offer a significant increase in goodput of legitimate TCP traffic for many choices of host density. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082044421

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in identifying network security threats. It protects the network for vulnerable source code, viruses, worms and unauthorized intruders for many intranet/internet applications. Despite many open source APIs and tools for intrusion detection, there are still many network security problems exist. These problems are handled through the proper pre-processing, normalization, feature selection and ranking on benchmark dataset attributes prior to the enforcement of self-learning-based classification algorithms. In this paper, we have performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of the benchmark datasets NSL-KDD and CIDDS-001. For getting optimal results, we have used the hybrid feature selection and ranking methods before applying self-learning (Machine / Deep Learning) classification algorithmic approaches such as SVM, Naïve Bayes, k-NN, Neural Networks, DNN and DAE. We have analyzed the performance of IDS through some prominent performance indicator metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score. The experimental results show that k-NN, SVM, NN and DNN classifiers perform approx. 100% accuracy regarding performance evaluation metrics on the NSL-KDD dataset whereas k-NN and Naïve Bayes classifiers perform approx. 99% accuracy on the CIDDS-001 dataset. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083651031

The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedent reliance on digital solutions, ranging from teleworking to virus-tracking systems, resulting in the proliferation of Covid-19 related cybercrime, critical information infrastructure attacks and dissemination of pandemic disinformation. Although the virus has been repeatedly portrayed as life altering and as having considerably increased the cybersecurity risks faced by States, businesses and citizens, the proposed solutions, however, have accelerated existing trends in the field rather than resulting in significant institutional change. In particular, there has been a reinforcement of the role as a coordinating actor, of the introduction of further coherence between sub-areas and instruments, and of the positioning of public-private partnerships at the heart of the policy. However, where the role of social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation is concerned, a changing trust relationship has resulted in a discursive shift in which these platforms require greater oversight, a belief reinforced by the spread of Covid-19 disinformation. The article proposes, through the lenses of historical and discursive institutionalism, that the EU’s response to Covid-19 in the field of cybersecurity can only be understood in light of these pre-existing trends, which are the result of an economic and security path dependence that emerged in the 1980s. © 2020 The Author(s).

Moreover, the traditional cybersecurity approach of protecting against known threats cannot withstand the rapidly evolving technologies and threats used by cybercriminals. This study claims that cyber resilience, a more holistic approach to cybersecurity, could help SMEs anticipate, detect, withstand, recover from and evolve after cyber incidents. However, to operationalize cyber resilience is not an easy task, and thus, the study presents a framework with a corresponding implementation order for SMEs that could help them implement cyber resilience practices. The framework is the result of using a variation of Design Science Research in which Grounded Theory was used to induce the most important actions required to implement cyber resilience and an iterative evaluation from experts to validate the actions and put them in a logical order. Therefore, this study proposes that the framework could benefit SME managers to understand cyber resilience, as well as help them start implementing it with concrete actions and an order dictated by the experience of experts.

Thus, securing the data, machines (devices), and user’s privacy in cyberspace has become an utmost concern for individuals, business organizations, and national governments. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed in cybersecurity, for example, intrusion or malware detection and biometric-based user authentication. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to attacks both in the training and testing phases, which usually leads to remarkable performance decreases and security breaches. Comparatively, limited studies have been conducted to understand the essence and degree of the vulnerabilities of ML techniques against security threats and their defensive mechanisms. It is imperative to systematize recent works related to cybersecurity using ML to seek the attention of researchers, scientists, and engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the works that have been carried out most recently (from 2013 to 2018) on ML in cybersecurity, describing the basics of cyber-attacks and corresponding defenses, the basics of the most commonly used ML algorithms, and proposed ML and data mining schemes for cybersecurity in terms of features, dimensionality reduction, and classification/detection techniques. In this context, this article also provides an overview of adversarial ML, including the security characteristics of deep learning methods.

In response, cybercriminals' attention has shifted dramatically from showing off skills and conducting individual attacks into high sophisticated attacks with financial gain as the goal. This, inevitably, poses a challenge to the cybersecurity community as they strive to find solutions to preserve the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the individual users' and corporates' private data and services. Cybercriminals mainly deploy malware to achieve their goals, which could be in the form of ransomware, botnets, etc. The use of encryption, packing and polymorphism techniques makes it harder to detect the malware files, especially when these are created in great numbers every day. In this paper, a novel framework, named Malware Spectrogram Image Classification (MSIC), is proposed. It employs spectrogram images in conjunction with the convolution neural network to classify a malware file to its corresponding family and to differentiate it from a benign file. Further, this research shares with the research community two privately collected labeled malicious and benign datasets. The evaluation of MSIC showed its effectiveness to be 91.6% F-measure and 92.8% accuracy in classifying malware files to their corresponding families, in comparison to, respectively, 90.6% and 92.3% results produced by the grayscale image classification approach. Likewise, in classifying files as malicious or benign, MSIC scored 96% F-measure and accuracy results compared to 95.5% with the grayscale solution. Also, MSIC required less computational time in converting and resizing the files than the grayscale framework. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086743880

Since the proposed architecture enjoys the advantages of zero management cost, good undetectability, and strong robustness, it is especially suited to resource-limited DDoS attackers. In this architecture and based on a novel botnet growth model, the optimal design of attack strategy is reduced to a variational problem, where the objective functional stands for the estimated expected impact of the DDoS attack associated with a DDoS attack strategy. Finally, the variational problem is resolved for three different types of DDoS defense strategies.

However, the data produced by modern system/network logs pose many problems, such as the streaming and non-stationary nature of such data, their volume and velocity, and the presence of imbalanced classes. Classifier ensembles look a valid solution for this scenario, owing to their flexibility and scalability. In particular, data-driven schemes for combining the predictions of multiple classifiers have been shown superior to traditional fixed aggregation criteria (e.g., predictions’ averaging and weighted voting). In intrusion detection settings, however, such schemes must be devised in an efficient way, since (part of) the ensemble may need to be re-trained frequently. A novel ensemble-based framework is proposed here for the online intrusion detection, where the ensemble is updated through an incremental stream-oriented learning scheme, correspondingly to the detection of concept drifts. Differently from mainstream ensemble-based approaches in the field, our proposal relies on deriving, though an efficient genetic programming (GP) method, an expressive kind of combiner function defined in terms of (non-trainable) aggregation functions. This approach is supported by a system architecture, which integrates different kinds of functionalities, ranging from the drift detection, to the induction and replacement of base classifiers, up to the distributed computation of GP-based combiners.

In this work, we perform a large-scale analysis of 13 popular domain classification services on more than 4.4M hostnames. Our study empirically explores their methodologies, scalability limitations, label constellations, and their suitability to academic research as well as other practical applications such as content filtering. We find that the coverage varies enormously across providers, ranging from over 90% to below 1%. All services deviate from their documented taxonomy, hampering sound usage for research. Further, labels are highly inconsistent across providers, who show little agreement over domains, making it difficult to compare or combine these services. We also show how the dynamics of crowd-sourced efforts may be obstructed by scalability and coverage aspects as well as subjective disagreements among human labelers. Finally, through case studies, we showcase that most services are not fit for detecting specialized content for research or content-blocking purposes.

Firstly, the impact of active and reactive power (PQ) set-points manipulation on the network is studied. Then, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed for identifying the potentially compromised PV inverters in the network. The proposed IDS is based on defining the normal, safe, and abnormal operation regions of the PV inverters from point of view of the steady state voltage stability of the network. These three-operation regions are identified by utilizing active power, reactive power, and voltage (PQV) limits of each specific grid-following inverter in the network. Each grid-following inverter's PQV contour includes the information of network topology, inverter ratings, and inverter controller. The developed PQ limits are integrated into the centralized secondary control layer for realization of the proposed IDS. Furthermore, the proposed secondary control layer is capable of providing remedial actions during an anomaly event to enhance the grid resiliency. The theoretical analyses are verified by several attack scenarios for a network of grid-following inverters. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096946219

Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a national survey to identify the overall implementation and application of telemedicine in Chinese tertiary hospitals and provide a scientific basis for the successful expansion of telemedicine in the future. Methods: The method of probability proportionate to size sampling was adopted to collect data from 161 tertiary hospitals in 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Charts and statistical tests were applied to compare the development of telemedicine, including management, network, data storage, software and hardware equipment, and application of telemedicine. Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between these factors and telemedicine service effect. Results: Approximately 93.8% (151/161) of the tertiary hospitals carried out telemedicine services in business-to-business mode. The most widely used type of telemedicine network was the virtual private network with a usage rate of 55.3% (89/161). Only a few tertiary hospitals did not establish data security and cybersecurity measures. Of the 161 hospitals that took part in the survey, 100 (62.1%) conducted remote videoconferencing supported by hardware instead of software. The top 5 telemedicine services implemented in the hospitals were teleconsultation, remote education, telediagnosis of medical images, tele-electrocardiography, and telepathology, with coverage rates of 86.3% (139/161), 57.1% (92/161), 49.7% (80/161), 37.9% (61/161), and 33.5% (54/161), respectively. The average annual service volume of teleconsultation reached 714 cases per hospital. Teleconsultation and telediagnosis were the core charging services. Multivariate analysis indicated that the adoption of direct-to-consumer mode (P=.003), support from scientific research funds (P=.01), charging for services (P<.001), number of medical professionals (P=.04), network type (P=.02), sharing data with other hospitals (P=.04), and expertise level (P=.03) were related to the effect of teleconsultation. Direct-to-consumer mode (P=.01), research funding (P=.01), charging for services (P=.01), establishment of professional management departments (P=.04), and 15 or more instances of remote education every month (P=.01) were found to significantly influence the effect of remote education. Conclusions: A variety of telemedicine services have been implemented in tertiary hospitals in China with a promising prospect, but the sustainability and further standardization of telemedicine in China are still far from accomplished. © Fangfang Cui, Qianqian Ma, Xianying He, Yunkai Zhai, Jie Zhao, Baozhan Chen, Dongxu Sun, Jinming Shi, Mingbo Cao, Zhenbo Wang.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094684695

As an important subset of cyber threats that impact many maritime systems, the vulnerabilities of satellite navigation systems, in particular the Global Positioning System (GPS), receive special attention. For this article, a systematic literature review was conducted, complemented by the research and analysis of a specific spoofing event. Analyzing available resources, we might summarize that a shift in mind-set is essential to direct more attention and resources toward cybersecurity as well as the necessity for manufacturers to improve the cybersecurity of their products, as shipping systems currently remain vulnerable to cybercriminals. There is a need for multiple positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems onboard maritime vessels to complement GPS-only navigation. The use of multiple satellite navigation constellations, public as well as private, in combination with the terrestrial components of an enhanced LOng-RAnge Navigation (eLoran) system and ports’ laser-based aid system for berthing and docking should provide the shipping industry with the direly needed increased protection from cyber-attackers for the foreseeable future. © 2020 by the authors.

The wind energy generated at the level of distributed generation also reduces the impact on the transmission system in terms of loss in the line and improves the efficiency of the power system. The increase in the level of penetration of wind power generation into an island power system network, causing severe threat in the system in terms of protection and security. The decrease in system inertia by means of increasing in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) causes an impact on the stability of the system and further may lead to a blackout of the system.

There is a growing trend of applying deep learning techniques to image processing, speech recognition, self-driving cars, and even health-care. Recently, several deep learning models have been employed to detect a cyber threat such as network attack, malware infiltration, or phishing website; nevertheless, they suffer from not being explainable to security experts. Security experts not only do need to detect the incoming threat but also need to know the incorporating features that cause that particular security incident. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a deep embedded neural network expert system (DeNNeS) that extracts refined rules from a trained deep neural network (DNN) architecture to substitute the knowledge base of an expert system. The knowledge base later is used to classify an unseen security incident and inform the final user of the corresponding rule that made that inference. We consider different rule extraction scenarios, and to prove the robustness of DeNNeS, we evaluate it on two cybersecurity datasets including UCI phishing websites dataset and Android malware dataset comprising more than 4000 Android APKs from several sources. The comparison results of DeNNeS with standalone DNN, JRip, and common machine learning algorithms show that DeNNeS with the retraining uncovered samples scenario outperforms other algorithms on both datasets. Furthermore, the extracted rules approximately reproduce the accuracy of the neural network from which they are derived. DeNNeS achieves an outstanding accuracy of 97.5 % and a negligible false positive rate of 1.8 % about 2.4 % higher and 3.5 % lower than the rule learner JRip on the phishing dataset. Moreover, DeNNeS outperforms random forest (RF), which produces the highest results among decision tree (DT), support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and Gaussian naive Bayes. Despite smaller training data in the malware dataset, DeNNeS achieves an accuracy of 95.8 % and F1score of 91.1 % , much higher than JRip and RF. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083901643

In this study, we aim to develop proactive CTI capabilities by exploring online hacker forums to identify emerging threats in terms of popularity and tool functionality. To achieve these goals, we create a novel Diachronic Graph Embedding Framework (D-GEF).

Semantic displacement measures adopted from diachronic linguistics literature identify how terminology evolves. A series of benchmark experiments illustrate D-GEF's ability to generate higher quality than state-of-the-art word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) in tasks pertaining to semantic analogy, clustering, and threat classification. D-GEF's practical utility is illustrated with in-depth case studies on web application and denial of service threats targeting PHP and Windows technologies, respectively.

We explore this apparent anomaly through a model, based on the relevant literature, casting consumers’ IoT Purchase Intention as driven by their pre-existing IoT Risk Knowledge, their level of IoT-related Security Concern, and their device-specific perceptions of Riskiness and Coolness. Based on this model, we collected survey data gauging Purchase Intention for four products varying in Riskiness and Coolness levels. Our analysis extends prior research by confirming the negative influence of IoT Risk Knowledge, implicating it as an emerging drag on IoT consumer demand growth. We further confirm the expected effects of Device Riskiness (negative) and Coolness (positive) as primary factors and we note the cognitive dissonance implied by the inherent IoT device trade-off: greater Coolness tends to come at the price of greater Riskiness.

Despite diplomatic activities at the United Nations over the past two decades, intersubjective agreement on norms governing coercive cyber power is still nascent. Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly. Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. This raises the question: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community’s understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date—WannaCry and NotPetya—caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide each with an estimated cost of several billion U.S. dollars? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN’s history, create two separate processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? To answer these questions, this article analyses the various factors feeding into the dynamic process of norm contestation including an in-depth discussion of the process at the United Nations, the role of international law, and the main points of critiques. © 2019, T.M.C.

Currently, most software is published in binary form, thus researchers can only detect vulnerabilities in these software by analysing binary programs. Although existing research approaches have made a substantial contribution to binary vulnerability detection, there are still many deficiencies, such as high false positive rate, detection with coarse granularity, and dependence on expert experience. Objective: The goal of this study is to perform fine-grained intelligent detection on the vulnerabilities in binary programs. This leads us to propose a fine-grained representation of binary programs and introduce deep learning techniques to intelligently detect the vulnerabilities. Method: We use program slices of library/API function calls to represent binary programs. Additionally, we design and construct a Binary Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) network model to intelligently learn vulnerability patterns and automatically detect vulnerabilities in binary programs. Results: This approach yields the design and implementation of a program slice-based binary code vulnerability intelligent detection system called BVDetector. We show that BVDetector can effectively detect vulnerabilities related to library/API function calls in binary programs, which reduces the false positive rate and false negative rate of vulnerability detection.

Electricity load forecasting under data integrity attacks has attracted great concern for power industries in recent years. However, most conventional load forecasting models lack the capacity to produce accurate results against data corruption. A comprehensive framework for robust load forecasting in the presence of imperfect datasets has not been discussed in the existing literature. This paper introduces a robust load forecasting framework to obtain higher prediction accuracy given different levels of data corruption. Firstly, the corrupted data is corrected by the anomaly detection method based on denoising variational autoencoder. Then, the combined robust forecasting model is established to integrate the independent advantages of different forecasters. The numerical results of case studies on the dataset of Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 demonstrate the outstanding effectiveness of the proposed method over other competing methods. Under different degrees of data corruption, the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed model is 2.37 and the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed model is 113.35, which represents the best performance among all competing models. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070272382

However, applications at the point of care are still scarce. Objective: Review and discuss case studies to understand current capabilities for applying AI/ML in the healthcare setting, and regulatory requirements in the US, Europe and China. Methods: A targeted narrative literature review of AI/ML based digital tools was performed. Scientific publications (identified in PubMed) and grey literature (identified on the websites of regulatory agencies) were reviewed and analyzed. Results: From the regulatory perspective, AI/ML-based solutions can be considered medical devices (i.e., Software as Medical Device, SaMD). A case series of SaMD is presented. First, tools for monitoring and remote management of chronic diseases are presented. Second, imaging applications for diagnostic support are discussed. Finally, clinical decision support tools to facilitate the choice of treatment and precision dosing are reviewed. While tested and validated algorithms for precision dosing exist, their implementation at the point of care is limited, and their regulatory and commercialization pathway is not clear. Regulatory requirements depend on the level of risk associated with the use of the device in medical practice, and can be classified into administrative (manufacturing and quality control), software-related (design, specification, hazard analysis, architecture, traceability, software risk analysis, cybersecurity, etc.), clinical evidence (including patient perspectives in some cases), non-clinical evidence (dosing validation and biocompatibility/toxicology) and other, such as e.g. benefit-to-risk determination, risk assessment and mitigation. There generally is an alignment between the US and Europe. China additionally requires that the clinical evidence is applicable to the Chinese population and recommends that a third-party central laboratory evaluates the clinical trial results. Conclusions: The number of promising AI/ML-based technologies is increasing, but few have been implemented widely at the point of care. The need for external validation, implementation logistics, and data exchange and privacy remain the main obstacles. © Copyright © 2020 Angehrn, Haldna, Zandvliet, Gil Berglund, Zeeuw, Amzal, Cheung, Polasek, Pfister, Kerbusch and Heckman.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087303733

This article discusses the key factors explaining states’ efforts to enhance their cyber capacity. Based on a cross-national quantitative research approach, the findings contradict international relations (IR)-derived approaches to cybersecurity, which assume that countries develop their cyber capacity according to external security threats, domestic politics or norms. In line with existing research on the role that science plays in policymaking processes more broadly, our results suggest instead that a country’s science and technical knowledge is the most robust explanation for that state’s cyber capacity level.

A malware coder writes malware into normal executable files. A computer is more likely to be infected by malware when users have easy access to various executables. Malware is considered as the starting point for cyber-attacks; thus, the timely detection, classification and blocking of malware are important. Malware visualization is a method for detecting or classifying malware. A global image is visualized through binaries extracted from malware. The overall structure and behavior of malware are considered when global images are utilized. However, the visualization of obfuscated malware is tough, owing to the difficulties encountered when extracting local features. This paper proposes a merged image-based malware classification framework that includes local feature visualization, global image-based local feature visualization, and global and local image merging methods. This study introduces a fastText-based local feature visualization method: First, local features such as opcodes and API function names are extracted from the malware; second, important local features in each malware family are selected via the term frequency inverse document frequency algorithm; third, the fastText model embeds the selected local features; finally, the embedded local features are visualized through a normalization process. Malware classification based on the proposed method using the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset was experimentally verified. The accuracy of the proposed method was approximately 99.65%, which is 2.18% higher than that of another contemporary global image-based approach. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087044709

The latter, in particular, poses new problems since passengers are used to manually driven vehicles; hence, they need to move their trust from a person to a computer. To smooth the transition towards autonomous vehicles, a delicate calibration of the driving functions should be performed, making the automation decision closest to the passengers’ expectations. The complexity of this calibration lies in the presence of a person in the loop: different settings of a given algorithm should be evaluated by assessing the human reaction to the vehicle decisions. With this work, we for an objective method to classify the people’s reaction to vehicle decisions. By adopting machine learning techniques, it is possible to analyze the passengers’ emotions while driving with alternative vehicle calibrations. Through the analysis of these emotions, it is possible to obtain an objective metric about the comfort feeling of the passengers.

They were then assigned a series of challenges that required developing progressively more advanced cybersecurity measures to protect their robots. This culminated in a final challenge that required implementing defensive measures such as encryption, secure key exchange, and sequence numbers to prevent cyber attacks during robot operations.We used an evidencecentered design framework to construct rubrics for grading student work. The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts.

Mirai is characterized by targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Since IoT devices are increasing explosively, it is not realistic to manage their vulnerability by human-wave tactics.

The white-hat worm is an extension of an IoT worm called Hajime and introduces lifespan and secondary infectivity (the ability to infect a device infected by Mirai). The proposed white-hat worm was expressed as a formal model with agent-oriented Petri nets called PN2 . The model enables us to simulate a battle between the white-hat worm and Mirai. The result of the simulation evaluation shows that (i) the lifespan successfully reduces the worm’s remaining if short; (ii) if the worm has low secondary infectivity, its effect depends on the lifespan; and (iii) if the worm has high secondary infectivity, it is effective without depending on the lifespan. © 2020 by the authors.

While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled with the wide-scale deployment of communication and sensing devices is important towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the cyber-threat landscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This article proposes a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS. The work takes into consideration the intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by microprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT) devices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the optimal attack transition policy based on N-2 contingency results, i.e., the simultaneous failure of two system elements. The effectiveness of the work is validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments performed on literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the proposed method based on deep Q-network (DQN) performs closely to a graph-search approach in terms of the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In addition, the experiments present the method's scalability by showcasing the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack transition policy in a large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The results exhibit how the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when compared to a random transition policy. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097648061

Chinese fintech companies have been successful in promoting financial inclusion and integration in their home country and are attempting to replicate this success in Southeast Asian markets. The rapid development of the Chinese fintech industry can be attributed to various factors, including a high degree of technological savvy among Chinese consumers, underdeveloped banking systems, a fintech-friendly regulatory environment, and China's improving scientific and technological prowess. Chinese technology companies are also successfully exporting their programs and technology to Southeast Asia, where many markets have a comparable base for new financial technologies. Geographic proximity as well as ethnic and cultural connections between China and Southeast Asia are also major facilitators that can help Chinese fintech companies succeed in the region. policy implications • Strict data privacy laws and regulations requiring control and scrutiny of inbound foreign investments prevent Chinese firms from engaging with Western and other advanced markets. Due to the absence of these constraints in Southeast Asian markets, China's fintech firms are emerging as major competitors. • Many Chinese fintech programs perform poorly with regard to security and privacy practices, which should be an issue of concern as they gain access to new markets. • Chinese technology firms operating in Southeast Asia could be pressured by the Chinese government to carry out censorship. For example, WeChat, used for messaging, social media, and mobile payments, has been accused of censorship activities in Southeast Asia and other foreign markets. • Western and other advanced economies such as Japan must make special efforts to bring institutional changes to Southeast Asian markets for fintech products, especially in the areas of data privacy, cybersecurity, and surveillance.

These deployments are based on behind-the-meter renewable energy resources and are labeled as 'prosumer setups', allowing customers to not only consume electricity, but also produce it. A residential nanogrid is comprised of a physical layer that is a household-scale electric power system, and a cyber layer that is used by manufacturers and/or grid operators to remotely monitor and control the nanogrid. With the increased penetration of renewable energy resources, nanogrids are at the forefront of a paradigm shift in the operational landscape and their correct operation is vital to the electric power grid. In this paper, we perform a cybersecurity assessment of a state-of-the art residential nanogrid deployment. For this purpose, we deployed a real-world experimental nanogrid setup that is based on photovoltaic (PV) generation. We analyzed the security and the resiliency of this system at both the cyber and physical layers. While we noticed improvements in the cybersecurity measures employed in the current nanogrid compared to previous generations, there are still major concerns. Our experiments show that these concerns range from exploiting well-known protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH) and Domain Name Service (DNS), to the leakage of confidential information, and major shortcomings in the software updating mechanism. While the compromise of multiple nanogrids can have a negative effect on the entire power grid, we focus our analysis on individual households and have determined through Simulink-based simulations the economic loss of a compromised deployment. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089555205

Cybersecurity in this sector is particularly important given the criticality of healthcare systems, the impacts of a breach or cyberattack (including in the worst instance, potential physical harm to patients) and the value of healthcare data to criminals. Technology design is important for cybersecurity, but it is also necessary to understand the insecure behaviours prevalent within healthcare. It is vital to identify the drivers behind these behaviours, i.e., why staff may engage in insecure behaviour including their goals and motivations and/or perceived barriers preventing secure behaviour. To achieve this, in-depth interviews with 50 staff were conducted at three healthcare sites, across three countries (Ireland, Italy and Greece). A range of seven insecure behaviours were reported: Poor computer and user account security; Unsafe e-mail use; Use of USBs and personal devices; Remote access and home working; Lack of encryption, backups and updates; Use of connected medical devices; and poor physical security. Thematic analysis revealed four key facilitators of insecure behaviour: Lack of awareness and experience, Shadow working processes, Behaviour prioritisation and Environmental appropriateness. The findings suggest three key barriers to security: i) Security perceived as a barrier to productivity and/or patient care; ii) Poor awareness of consequences of behaviour; and iii) a lack of policies and reinforcement of secure behaviour.

In this paper, we introduce a high-level transdisciplinary system clustering of ethical distinction between antithetical clusters of Type I and Type II systems which extends a cybersecurity-oriented AI safety taxonomy with considerations from psychology. Moreover, we review relevant Type I AI risks, reflect upon possible epistemological origins of hypothetical Type II AI from a cognitive sciences perspective and discuss the related human moral perception. Strikingly, our nuanced transdisciplinary analysis yields the figurative formulation of the so-called AI safety paradox identifying AI control and value alignment as conjugate requirements in AI safety. Against this backdrop, we craft versatile multidisciplinary recommendations with ethical dimensions tailored to Type II AI safety.

Accordingly, NPPs were regarded as safe from external cyber-attacks. However, it was later determined that isolated networks are not safe from cyber-attacks. Malicious data injection attacks on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) deployed in the safety system of NPPs are critical to nuclear facilities, as they were in the Stuxnet attack. It is necessary to monitor the integrity of PLC data and protect the PLCs from cyber threats such as modification of deployed logic or setpoints. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel system for monitoring data integrity of PLCs using blockchain technologies. Considering the NPP environment, we developed a private blockchain system to monitor the data integrity of PLCs. The new concept that is Proof of Monitoring (PoM) for data integrity of PLCs was proposed to overcome the limitation for applying the private blockchain to the cybersecurity of NPPs. Additionally, we developed an integrity monitoring system for the Reactor Protection System (RPS) - a safety system in NPPs - using the developed blockchain. It can detect cyber-attacks (such as false code injection attacks on PLCs) and monitor which PLC integrity has been compromised in real-time. A validation experiment using a false data injection attack on PLCs was performed on the developed system, and the results confirmed that the developed system successfully monitored the modification of data in the PLCs. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088291269

In this paper, the model that generates the report in natural language by means of applying novel storytelling techniques from security logs is proposed. The solution caters for different levels of reader expertise and preference by providing adjustable templates, filled from both local and global knowledge base. The validation is performed on case study from Security Operations Centre (SOC) at educational institution. The report generated proves superior to existing approach in terms of comprehension (increased cognition) and completeness (enriched context). The evaluation demonstrates power of storytelling in potential threats interpretation in cybersecurity context. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079802872

This research looks at prediction and detection in the railway industry. It uses an extended cyber kill chain (CKC) model and an industrial control system (ICS) cyber kill chain for detection and proposes predictive technologies that will help railway organizations predict and recover from cyber-attacks. The extended CKC model consists of both internal and external cyber kill chain; breaking the chain at an early stage will help the defender stop the adversary's malicious actions. This research incorporates an OSA (open system architecture) for railways with the railway cybersecurity OSA-CBM (open system architecture for condition-based maintenance) architecture. The railway cybersecurity OSACBM architecture consists of eight layers; cybersecurity information moves from the initial level of data acquisition to data processing, data analysis, incident detection, incident assessment, incident prognostics, decision support, and visualization. The main objective of the research is to predict, prevent, detect, and respond to cyber-attacks early in the CKC by using defensive controls called the Railway Defender Kill Chain (RDKC). The contributions of the research are as follows. First, it adapts and modifies the railway cybersecurity OSA-CBM architecture for railways. Second, it adapts the cyber kill chain model for the railway. Third, it introduces the Railway Defender Kill Chain. Fourth, it presents examples of cyber-attack scenarios in the railway system. © 2019 the Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079133453

However, due to the openness and unpredictable nature of the wireless network, it is often prone to different adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities to launch cross-layer attacks during data transmission. To address this issue, we proposed a novel trust-based routing framework with Bayesian Inference to calculate direct trust and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory is used to compute the indirect trust by combining the evidence collected from reliable neighbours. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) calculates the node's creditability trust by taking cross-layer metrics like transmission rate, buffering capacity and received signal strength. Further, the fuzzy theory is combined with BDS-AHP to incorporate fairness in utilizing cross-layer metrics for calculating the link trust to enable reliable routing. Extensive experiments are carried to evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy-based trusted routing algorithm (FBDS-AHP) with the presence of malicious nodes launching packet-dropping, bad-mouthing, on-off and Sybil attacks.

Predicting the exploitability of vulnerabilities is crucial for decision-makers to prioritize their efforts and patch the most critical vulnerabilities. Software vulnerability descriptions are accessible features in early stage and contain rich semantic information. Therefore, descriptions are wildly used for exploitability prediction in both industry and academia. However, comparing with other corpora, the size of vulnerability description corpus is too small to train a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. To gain a better performance, this paper proposes a framework named ExBERT to accurately predict if a vulnerability will be exploited or not. ExBERT essentially is an improved Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for exploitability prediction. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT using collected domain-specific corpus. Then, we design a Pooling Layer and a Classification Layer on top of the fine-tuned BERT model to extract sentence-level semantic features and predict the exploitability of vulnerabilities. Results on 46,176 real-word vulnerabilities have demonstrated that the proposed ExBERT framework achieves 91.12% on accuracy and 91.82% on precision, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach with 89.0% on accuracy and 81.8% on precision. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092712488

Supervised classifiers are prone to adversarial evasion, and existing countermeasures suffer from many limitations. Most solutions degrade performance in the absence of adversarial perturbations; they are unable to face novel attack variants; they are applicable only to specific machine learning algorithms. We propose the first framework that can protect botnet detectors from adversarial attacks through deep reinforcement learning mechanisms. It automatically generates realistic attack samples that can evade detection, and it uses these samples to produce an augmented training set for producing hardened detectors. In such a way, we obtain more resilient detectors that can work even against unforeseen evasion attacks with the great merit of not penalizing their performance in the absence of specific attacks. We validate our proposal through an extensive experimental campaign that considers multiple machine learning algorithms and public datasets.

In this cross-sectional policy review, we assessed stay-at-home orders issued in March or April 2020.

Others referenced the US Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advisory memorandum on essential critical infrastructure workers which named workers supporting firearm manufacturing and retail among essential workers. Therefore, stay-at-home orders issued in most states included provisions for firearms retailers to remain open, at least in some capacity. Only four states and the District of Columbia did not include federal firearms licensees among essential businesses or include provisions for them to be open.

One of the key challenges in advancing the state of the art in intrusion detection is the lack of representative datasets. These datasets typically contain millions of time-ordered events (e.g. network packet traces, flow summaries, log entries); subsequently analysed to identify abnormal behavior and specific attacks (Duffield et al., April). Generating realistic datasets has historically required expensive networked assets, specialised traffic generators, and considerable design preparation. Even with advances in virtualisation it remains challenging to create and maintain a representative environment. Major improvements are needed in the design, quality and availability of datasets, to assist researchers in developing advanced detection techniques. With the emergence of new technology paradigms, such as intelligent transport and autonomous vehicles, it is also likely that new classes of threat will emerge (Kenyon, 2018). Given the rate of change in threat behavior (Ugarte-Pedrero et al., 2019) datasets become quickly obsolete, and some of the most widely cited datasets date back over two decades. Older datasets have limited value: often heavily filtered and anonymised, with unrealistic event distributions, and opaque design methodology. The relative scarcity of (Intrusion Detection System) IDS datasets is compounded by the lack of a central registry, and inconsistent information on provenance. Researchers may also find it hard to locate datasets or understand their relative merits. In addition, many datasets rely on simulation, originating from academic or government institutions. The publication process itself often creates conflicts, with the need to de-identify sensitive information in order to meet regulations such as General Data Protection Act (GDPR) (Regulation, 2016). Another final issue for researchers is the lack of standardised metrics with which to compare dataset quality. In this paper we attempt to classify the most widely used public intrusion datasets, providing references to archives and associated literature. We illustrate their relative utility and scope, highlighting the threat composition, formats, special features, and associated limitations. We identify best practice in dataset design, and describe potential pitfalls of designing anomaly detection techniques based on data that may be either inappropriate, or compromised due to unrealistic threat coverage. Such contributions as made in this paper is expected to facilitate continuous research and development for effectively combating the constantly evolving cyber threat landscape.

To help fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers involved in aDBS trials (n = 23) to gain insight into the most pressing ethical questions in aDBS research and any concerns about specific features of aDBS devices, including devices’ ability to measure brain activity, automatically adjust stimulation, and store neural data. Using thematic content analysis, we identified 8 central themes in researcher responses. The need to measure and store neural data for aDBS raised concerns among researchers about data privacy and security issues (noted by 91% of researchers), including the avoidance of unintended or unwanted third-party access to data. Researchers reflected on the risks and safety (83%) of aDBS due to the experimental nature of automatically modulating then observing stimulation effects outside a controlled clinical setting and in relation to need for surgical battery changes. Researchers also stressed the importance of ensuring informed consent and adequate patient understanding (74%). Concerns related to automaticity and device programming (65%) were discussed, including current uncertainties about biomarker validity. Additionally, researchers discussed the potential impacts of automatic stimulation on patients’ autonomy and control over stimulation (57%). Lastly, researchers discussed concerns related to patient selection (defining criteria for candidacy) (39%), challenges of ensuring post-trial access to care and device maintenance (39%), and potential effects on personality and identity (30%). To help address researcher concerns, we discuss the need to minimize cybersecurity vulnerabilities, advance biomarker validity, promote the balance of device control between patients and clinicians, and enhance ongoing informed consent. The findings from this study will help inform policies that will maximize the benefits and minimize potential harms of aDBS and other next-generation DBS devices. © Copyright © 2020 Muñoz, Kostick, Sanchez, Kalwani, Torgerson, Hsu, Sierra-Mercado, Robinson, Outram, Koenig, Pereira, McGuire, Zuk and Lázaro-Muñoz.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096680879

The framework looks into cyberspace through the dynamics lens because environments in cyberspace often evolve with time (e.g., software vulnerabilities, attack capabilities, defense capabilities, and cybersecurity states). The dynamics lens offers a unique viewpoint, which guides the modeling of the various situations which evolve with respect to cybersecurity. This type of evolution is driven by attackers, defenders, and users of related systems and is manifested by their attack/defense/use activities. Since its inception in 2014, there has been significant progress in characterizing and taming various kinds of cybersecurity dynamics.

The considered attack scenario is manipulation of the advanced measuring infrastructures (AMIs) readings and/or smart inverters data. These manipulated data from the grid edge devices mislead the grid operator for making proper operational planning decisions. In a stealthy attack model, where the attacker compromises significant number of these smart devices, serious demand-supply unbalance can occur that may result in major blackouts. The proposed IDS is based on a condition monitoring vector (CMV) equipped with a learned ultra-short-term demand forecasting (USTDF) mechanism. This cybersecurity approach is able to verify smart devices readings. In the proposed method, the instantaneous difference of collected AMIs and other smart devices data with the ultra-short term forecasted demand is defined as the CMV. This vector probes a pre-defined error band for identifying the compromised smart devices. The learned USTDF mechanism is based on the distribution grid historical load profile and the temperature data for the goal area. An accurate multi-dimensional regression model is developed and learned for forecasting the load behavior in this area. Finally, the suspicious areas are flagged or become separated from the main grid by the network operator based on the proposed CMV outcomes and the output of decision-making module. The proposed IDS aims to enhance the cybersecurity of the smart devices at the grid-edge that plays major role in ensuring the resiliency of the grid.

The presented framework models the connections of assets and devices so as to depict their interdependencies on a company's business processes and effectively reduces their overall risk against cybersecurity threats. It achieves this by (1) identifying critical components and dependency structural risks, (2) prioritizing assets based on their influence on business processes and (3) proposing network restructures and asset clusters. To do that, the proposed algorithm utilizes (i) dependency risk graphs for modeling and analyzing networks dependencies, (ii) graph minimum spanning trees, and (iii) network centrality metrics. We test the implementation on a real-world company and demonstrate its effectiveness. Results show that the framework can automatically identify critical components and dependency structural risks and propose different network topologies by creating the optimum number of asset subnets, while retaining business operations. Tests show that the closeness centrality metric combined with the midpoint on extreme values calculation type works best for network asset grouping and subnetting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085584926

However, difficulty exists for both the industry and organizations in assessing this potential solution. Hence, it is important to understand how organizations in the financial sector can address these concerns by exploring blockchain implementation for financial transactions in the context of cybersecurity. To do this, the problem question is threefold: first, what objectives are important based on the strategic values of an organization for evaluating cybersecurity to improve the security of financial transactions? Second, how can they be used to ensure the cybersecurity of financial transactions in a financial organization? Third, how can these objectives be used to evaluate blockchain as a potential solution for enhancing the cybersecurity of organizations in the financial sector relative to existing cybersecurity methods? The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: To accomplish this goal we utilize Keeney’s (1992) multi-objective decision analytics technique, termed value-focused thinking (VFT), to demonstrate how organizations can assess a blockchain solution’s value to maximize value-add within financial organization. Findings: The presented model clearly demonstrates the viability of using Keeney’s (1992) VFT technique as a multi-criteria decision analysis tool for assessing blockchain technology. Further, a clear explanation of how this model can be extended and adapted for individual organizational use is provided. Originality/value: This paper engages both the academic literature as well as an expert panel to develop an assessment model for blockchain technology related to financial transactions by providing a useful method for structuring the decision-making process of organizations around blockchain technology. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074016223

The recovered C source code, once recompiled, will produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications, including legacy software migration, security retrofitting, software comprehension, and to act as the first step in launching adversarial software exploitations. As the paramount component and the trust base in numerous cybersecurity tasks, C decompilers have enabled the analysis of malware, ransomware, and promoted cybersecurity professionals' understanding of vulnerabilities in real-world systems. In contrast to this flourishing market, our observation is that in academia, outputs of C decompilers (i.e., recovered C source code) are still not extensively used. Instead, the intermediate representations are often more desired for usage when developing applications such as binary security retrofitting. We acknowledge that such conservative approaches in academia are a result of widespread and pessimistic views on the decompilation correctness. However, in conventional software engineering and security research, how much of a problem is, for instance, reusing a piece of simple legacy code by taking the output of modern C decompilers? In this work, we test decompilation correctness to present an up-to-date understanding regarding modern C decompilers. We detected a total of 1,423 inputs that can trigger decompilation errors from four popular decompilers, and with extensive manual effort, we identified 13 bugs in two open-source decompilers. Our findings show that the overly pessimistic view of decompilation correctness leads researchers to underestimate the potential of modern decompilers; the state-of-the-art decompilers certainly care about the functional correctness, and they are making promising progress. However, some tasks that have been studied for years in academia, such as type inference and optimization, still impede C decompilers from generating quality outputs more than is reflected in the literature. These issues rarely receive enough attention and can lead to great confusion that misleads users. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088923487

Risky behaviors were measured using the instrument by Hadlington (2017), previously used by researchers to measure behavioral associations with non-technology threat avoidance-related items. Hierarchical regression noted significant predictive associations between several technology threat avoidance factors and self-reported risky cybersecurity behavior: perceived susceptibility (p = .027), perceived cost (p = .003), and self-efficacy (p = .043). Combined, these variables explained 9.4% of the adjusted variance in levels of risky cybersecurity behavior (p = .001). Effect size calculations revealed predictive impacts in the low-medium range.

AIS is a time-slotted protocol that also provides unicast messages-usually employed to manage self-separation and to exchange safety information. However, AIS does not provide any security feature. The messages are exchanged in clear-text, and they are not authenticated, being vulnerable to several attacks, including forging and replay. Despite the existing contributions in the literature propose some strategies to overcome the exposed weaknesses, some are insecure, others do not comply with the standard, while the remaining few ones would introduce an unacceptable overhead-that is, they would require a relevant number of AIS-time slots, because of the limited payload available for each time-slot. In this paper, we propose SecureAIS, a key agreement scheme that allows any pair of vessels in reach of an AIS radio to agree on a shared session key of the desired length, by requiring just a fraction of the AIS time-slots of competing solutions. Further, the scheme is fully standard compliant and does not require any modification to the available hardware. The proposed scheme integrates the Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certification scheme and the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key agreement technique, requiring moderate computational overhead while enjoying an optimal usage of the available bandwidth. When configured with the highest security level of 256 bits, SecureAIS allows two AIS transceivers to agree on a shared session key in 20 time-slots, against the 96 time-slots required by the competing solution based on traditional X.509 certificates. The proposed solution has been implemented and tested in a real scenario, while its security has been formally evaluated through the ProVerif tool.

Moreover, an ensemble-based detection scheme is further proposed to enhance the detection performance. Two open datasets (i.e., NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15) are used to evaluate the proposed schemes. In comparison, Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are implemented as baseline IDS (i.e., CNN-IDS and SVM-IDS).

This introduction argues that the management and contestation of elections have now entered a qualitative new historical period because of the combined development of new technology and broader sociological developments. The era of cyber-elections is marked by: (a) the new ontological existence of the digital, (b) new flows of data and communication, (c) the rapid acceleration of pace in communications, (d) the commodification of electoral data, and (e) an expansion of actors involved in elections. These provide opportunities for state actors to incorporate technology into the electoral process to make democratic goals more realizable. But it also poses major threats to the running of elections as the activities of actors and potential mismanagement of the electoral process could undermine democratic ideals such as political equality and popular control of government.

Therefore, additional safety engineering efforts, design approaches, and well-established safety processes have been stipulated. Today many connected and automated vehicles are available and connectivity features and information sharing are increasingly used. This increases the attractiveness of an attack on vehicles and thus introduces new risks for vehicle cybersecurity. Thus, just as safety became a critical part of the development in the late 20th century, the automotive domain must now consider cybersecurity as an integral part of the development of modern vehicles. Aware of this fact, the automotive industry has, therefore, recently taken multiple efforts in designing and producing safe and secure connected and automated vehicles. As the domain geared up for the cybersecurity challenges, they leveraged experiences from many other domains, but must face several unique challenges. For that aim, the domain invested multiple efforts in the development of industry standards to tackle automotive cybersecurity issues and protect their assets. The joint working group of the standardization organizations ISO and SAE has recently established and published a committee draft of the""ISO/SAE CD 21434 Road Vehicles-Cybersecurity Engineering"" standard. This paper will summarize the previous results and extensions of the SoQrates assessment model, the working group's vision and work from prior publications, how Automotive SPICE can also support the auditing of projects with close security relations, also in the context of the new ISO/SAE CD 21434. This work will show enhanced and adapted approach details for the new ISO/SAE CD 21434 norm requirements. Further, we propose a structured method for integrating security and safety engineering in the existing Automotive SPICE context. Additionally, provide methodical descriptions for the security development based on an in-depth treatment on signal and data-level to determine the essential security architecture requirements on the system level. © 2020 SAE International.

Ecomodernists and other techno-optimists argue for the feasibility of absolute decoupling, whereas degrowth advocates show that it is likely to be neither feasible in principle nor in the timeframe needed to ward off ecological tipping points. While primarily supporting the degrowth perspective, I will suggest that the ecomodernists have a wildcard in their pocket that hasn’t been systematically addressed by degrowth advocates. This is the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’, which refers to convergent innovations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and other developments. However, I will argue that while these innovations may enable some degree of absolute decoupling, they will also intensify emerging risks in the domains of biosecurity, cybersecurity, and state securitization. Overall, these technologies will not only place unprecedented destructive power in the hands of non-state actors but will also empower and incentivize states to create a global security regime with unprecedented surveillance and force mobilization capacities. This reinforces the conclusion that mainstream environmental policies based on decoupling should be reconsidered and supplanted by alternative policy trajectories based on material-energetic degrowth, redistribution, and technological deceleration. © 2020 Durham University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083579065

All attack scenarios are based on real radar signals generated by Texas Instruments AWR series 77 GHz radars, and all measurements are done using the same radar family. For sensor networks, including interconnected autonomous vehicles sharing radar measurements, cyberattacks at the network/communication layer is a known critical problem, and has been addressed by several different researchers. What is addressed in this paper is cyberattacks at the physical layer, that is, adversarial agents generating 77 GHz electromagnetic waves which may cause a false target detection, false distance/velocity estimation, or not detecting an existing target. The main algorithm proposed in this paper is not a predictive filtering based cyberattack detection scheme where an “unusual” difference between measured and predicted values triggers an alarm.

Although these frameworks are exceptional at performing qualitative cybersecurity analysis and identifying vulnerabilities, they do not provide a means to perform prioritized mitigation of those vulnerabilities in order to achieve a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we developed a framework and software application called the cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). This paper presents the detailed architecture of CyFEr's enhanced prioritized gap analysis (EPGA) methodology and its application to CSF.

The interventions were developed after an Appreciative Inquiry and Grounded Theory survey of security professionals to find out what approaches work best.

It relied on building models of the normal/legitimate activities registered at the protected systems, from them analyzing the incoming observations looking for significant discordances that may reveal misbehaviors. But in the last years, the adversarial machine learning paradigm introduced never-seen-before evasion procedures able to jeopardize the traditional anomaly-based methods, thus entailing one of the major emerging challenges in the cybersecurity landscape. With the aim on contributing to their adaptation against adversarial threats, this paper presents EsPADA (Enhanced Payload Analyzer for malware Detection robust against Adversarial threats), a novel approach built on the grounds of the PAYL sensor family. At the SPARTA Training stage, both normal and adversarial models are constructed according to features extracted by N-gram, which are stored within Counting Bloom Filters (CBF). In this way it is possible to take advantage of both binary-based and spectral-based traffic modeling procedures for malware detection. At Detection stage, the payloads to be analyzed are collected from the protected environment and compared with the usage models previously built at Training. This leads to calculate different scores that allow to discriminate their nature (normal or suspicious) and to assess the labeling coherency, the latest studied for estimating the likelihood of the payload disguising mimicry attacks.

An efficient IDS apply machine learning method as computational technics to increase rates of detection to gain the high accuracy and low false alarms rate within the huge amounts of data. To increase the rate of detection, researcher usually implements the optimizer. Thus, in this research, a comprehensive experimental study is presented based on various binary to optimize the rate of detection and decrease the error. Moreover, Numerous researches have been conducted about intrusion detection systems with the old dataset such as Kddcup'99 dataset, and due to this reason, most of them did not get the potential accuracy to detect intrusion with the current intrusion as the old dataset is not covering the current attacks.

Despite the tremendous benefits, various cybersecurity threats of IoT can also be inherited by the sector. In this paper, we propose a lightweight specification-based distributed detection to identify the misbehavior of heterogeneous embedded IoT nodes efficiently and effectively in a closed-loop smart greenhouse farming system. To expand the monitoring space of a node, we exploited the Kalman-filter algorithm and simple statistical operations to obtain estimates of data. Accordingly, this enables a monitoring node to assess a target node that has distinct physical characteristics and access to natural phenomena. Along with this, we derive the behavior-rules that are specific to the target system and carefully translate these rules into a state machine diagram. Besides, we formally verify the functional correctness of the monitoring processes as well as ensure that the behavior specifications are completely covered by using the model checker tool UPPAAL. Through extensive experimental simulation using Proteus, we verify its applicability to resource-constrained embedded devices, e.g., Arduino-Uno, as well as show high accuracy in detecting misbehaving nodes while having low false alarms. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The adverse scenarios arising due to cyberattacks are carefully reviewed in this study, which includes (a) interfering with the main charger controller (FPGA) logic and its data, (b) establishing fake communication between the charging controller and other electronic control units (ECUs) connected over same controller area network (CAN) bus, and (c) interfering with the battery management system functionalities. A 6.6kW interleaved totem-pole PFC front-end followed by a high frequency DC-DC converter is used as our OBC representative system in this analysis. Possibilities and ways of potential cyberattacks on this model are investigated in detail. Effort is made towards providing software as well as hardware design-level protection mechanisms to mitigate the malicious effects of such cyberattacks on the OBC hardware. This system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the fault occurrences under various data integrity attacks as well as to validate the effectiveness of our proposed countermeasure approaches. Quantitative analyses of the obtained results clearly demonstrate that if adequate precautionary measures are properly taken while designing the charging architecture (e.g., implementing intelligence to the main controller), any electrical hazard or deterioration of health of the components can be avoided to the maximum extent under the circumstances of a malicious cyberattack.

Phishing detection approaches that obtain highly representational features from the text of these e-mails are a suitable strategy to counter these threats since these features can be used to train machine learning algorithms, thus generating models able to classify mail samples as phishing or legitimate messages. This paper proposes a multi-stage approach to detect phishing e-mail attacks using natural language processing and machine learning. The proposed multi-stage approach consists of feature engineering within natural language processing, lemmatization, feature selection, feature extraction, improved learning techniques for resampling and cross-validation, and the configuration of hyperparameters. We present two methods of the proposed approach, the first one exploiting the Chi-Square statistics and the Mutual Information to improve the dimensionality reduction, while the second method associates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Both methods handle the problems of the 'curse of dimensionality', the sparsity, and the amount of information that must be obtained from the context in the Vector Space Model (VSM) representation. These methods yield reduced feature sets that, combined with the XGBoost and Random Forest machine learning algorithms, lead to an F1-measure of 100% success rate, for validation tests with the SpamAssassin Public Corpus and the Nazario Phishing Corpus datasets. Even considering just the text in e-mail bodies, the proposed multi-stage phishing detection approach outperforms state-of-the-art schemes for an accredited data set, requiring a much smaller number of features and presenting lower computational cost. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097934796

Using a recursive linearisation procedure, a complex nonlinear stochastic combinatorial optimisation model with a classical exponential function of breach probability is transformed into its linear equivalent. The obtained linear optimisation model is capable of selecting optimal portfolio of security safeguards to minimise cybersecurity investment and expected cost of losses from security breaches in a supply chain. The new efficiency measures of cybersecurity investment are introduced: cybersecurity value and cybersecurity ratio. In addition, the proposed linear model has been enhanced for the Hurwicz-type, best–worst criterion to minimise a convex combination of the minimal and the maximal supply chain node vulnerability, under limited budget. The resulting compromise cybersecurity investment aims at balancing vulnerability over the entire supply chain, independent of cyberattack probabilities and potential losses by security breaches, thereby hardening the weaker critical nodes.

Extracting cyber-knowledge from these sources would provide security analysts with credible information, which they can use to detect or find patterns indicative of a cyber-attack. In this paper, we describe a system to extract information from AARs, aggregate the extracted information by fusing similar entities together, and represent that extracted information in a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG). We extract entities by building a customized named entity recognizer called 'Malware Entity Extractor' (MEE). We then build a neural network to predict how pairs of 'malware entities' are related to each other. When we have predicted entity pairs and the relationship between them, we assert the 'entity-relationship set' in a CKG. Our next step in the process is to fuse similar entities, to improve our CKG. This fusion helps represent intelligence extracted from multiple documents and reports. The fused CKG has knowledge from multiple AARs, with relationships between entities extracted from separate reports. As a result of this fusion, a security analyst can execute queries and retrieve better answers on the fused CKG, than a knowledge graph with no fusion. We also showcase various reasoning capabilities that can be leveraged by a security analyst using our fused CKG. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096878221

Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated.

Regardless of whether we have a computer at home, whether we use the possibilities of obtaining state and municipal services in digital form or simply operate electronic gadgets, society's dependence on technology is increasing. A secure digital environment enhances trust and contributes to the creation of a stable and prosperous nation. Government and the business community are also taking advantage of the technological revolution through greater adoption and use of digital technologies. Traditional forms of crime have also evolved, as criminal associations increasingly use the information and telecommunications network — the Internet — to commit cybercrimes and increase their profits. Digital crime is developing at an incredibly fast pace, and new types of criminal acts are constantly emerging. So we need to keep up with digital technologies, understand the opportunities they create for cybercriminals, and how they can be used as a tool to combat cybercrime. The active use of digital technologies in all spheres of social life in the last three decades formed a background for the emergence of a special type of criminals — the so-called hackers. Criminal groups of hackers pose a public danger because, if they unite, they are capable of planning a large-scale computer attack which could target, among other things, critically important information infrastructure objects. Besides, hacker groups have become a real danger for both governments, large corporations, the military, and for private persons. The trend for blurring the boundaries between hacker groups and organized crime, that the experts predicted a few years ago, has now become a reality. In fact, it is possible to say that a new independent type of organized crime has emerged — the hacking community. These circumstances make it necessary to develop a special norm that provides for the liability for organizing hacking community or participating in it. Such a norm will allow for a complex approach to the criminal law counteraction against such criminal groups by ensuring an adequate criminal law assessment of the actions of the organizers and coordinators of hackers’ organizations. © 2020, Baikal National University of Economics and Law.

Thus, it is imperative to detect such threats. However, traditional approaches for malicious URLs detection that based on the blacklists are easy to be bypassed and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. In this paper, we propose a novel malicious URL detection method based on deep learning model to protect against web attacks. Specifically, we firstly use auto-encoder to represent URLs.

The primary factor is the secondary infectivity of the white-hat worms. If it is high, the BDS only has to launch a few white-hat worms.

Despite several academic and industry research initiatives, full protection of online resources from these network intrusions is not feasible. Therefore, several techniques have been developed that use network audit data for accurate detection of network intrusions effectively and efficiently and are used in network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs). But, most of NIDSs reported low detection accuracy with high false alarm rate and provide a single solution that lacks in classification trade-offs. In this paper, the authors present a hybrid approach of multi-objective genetic algorithm and neural networks for creating a set of ensemble solutions for detecting network intrusions effectively. The proposed approach works in two phases that initially creates a set of non-dominating solutions or Pareto optimal solutions of base techniques and then creates ensemble solutions. In the outcome of individual solutions or models in the ensemble are aggregated using most popular method of majority voting. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated using benchmark datasets of NSL_KDD and ISCX-2012 datasets for intrusion detection. The evaluation results using benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach enables detecting network intrusions effectively as compared to conventional ensemble approaches, namely bagging and boosting. The resultant ensemble solutions are non-dominating and provide classification trade-offs for cybersecurity administrators. The results also show that the proposed hybrid approach detects both minority and majority intrusion types accurately. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrated a detection accuracy of 97% and 88% with FPR of 2.4% and 2% for ISCX-2012 and NSL_KDD datasets, respectively. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074795656

Proper handling of software vulnerabilities is essential in the industrial context, particularly when the software is deployed in critical infrastructures. Therefore, several industrial standards mandate secure coding guidelines and industrial software developers’ training, as software quality is a significant contributor to secure software. CyberSecurity Challenges (CSC) form a method that combines serious game techniques with cybersecurity and secure coding guidelines to raise secure coding awareness of software developers in the industry. These cybersecurity awareness events have been used with success in industrial environments. However, until now, these coached events took place on-site.

Also, it plays a key role in planning essential issues such as electrical energy management and cybersecurity in hospitals. In addition to being able to make this measurement objectively with the help of various indicators, it can become very complicated with the participation of subjective expert thoughts in the process. Method: As a result of budget cuts in health expenditures worldwide, the necessity of using hospital resources most efficiently emerges. The most effective way to do this is to determine the evaluation criteria effectively. Machine learning (ML) is the current method to determine these criteria, determined by consulting with experts in the past. ML methods, which can remain utterly objective concerning all indicators, offer fair and reliable results quickly and automatically. Based on this idea, this study provides an automated healthcare system evaluation framework by automatically assigning weights to specific indicators. First, the ability of hands to be used as input and output is measured. Results: As a result of this measurement, indicators are divided into only input group (group A) and both input and output group (group B). In the second step, the total effect of each input on the output is calculated by using the indicators in group B as output sequentially using the random forest of the regression tree model. Conclusion: Finally, the total effect of each indicator on the healthcare system is determined. Thus, the whole system is evaluated objectively instead of a subjective evaluation based on a single output. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092436354

During the last few years, the agrotechnology community, public sector, and researchers have been alerted to the problem and a significant amount of research has focused on the issue. However, the majority of the existing work focuses on external threats or specific parts of the farm technology ecosystem. This work examines the cybersecurity capabilities of individual farms and focuses on the farm local area network; the network and connected devices of six dairy farms in Finland are examined in detail. In addition, the farmers were interviewed in order to ascertain their opinions and understanding of agricultural cybersecurity. The results of the reviews were mixed. The physical cabling, for example, was all in good condition and followed appropriate regulations. On the other hand, network topology, malware protection, and system backups were not handled appropriately. Surveillance cameras typically did not work as expected. Often, the farmers did not know the network topology, the connected devices, or the details of individual devices in the network. In summary, the cybersecurity on the farms reviewed in this work was not handled optimally and significant improvements would be needed in order to secure the reviewed systems. However, since the approach of this work is qualitative in nature, care must be taken when generalizing the results. In conclusion, there is a significant need for improvements in agricultural cybersecurity on the level of individual farms. Many of the threats faced by farms are caused by their own activity or the physical environment and thus, emphasis must be put on improving their own situations. © 2020 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092300700

With the aim of improving the security of the network, it is desirable to find out which are the most critical nodes in order to protect them from external attackers. This work tackles this problem, named the α-separator problem, from a heuristic perspective, proposing an algorithm based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). In particular, a novel approach for the constructive procedure is proposed, where centrality metrics derived from social network analysis are used as a greedy criterion. Furthermore, the quality of the provided solutions is improved by means of a combination method based on Path Relinking (PR). This work explores different variants of PR, also adapting the most recent one, Exterior PR, for the problem under consideration.

Vulnerability studies aim at differentiating impacts and losses by using fine-grained information from demographic, social, and personal characteristics of humans. With ongoing digital development, these characteristics will transform and result in new traits, which need to be identified and integrated. Digital transformations will produce new social groups, partly human, semi-human, or non-human—some of which already exist, and some which can be foreseen by extrapolating from recent developments in the field of brain wearables, robotics, and software engineering. Though involved in the process of digital transformation, many researchers and practitioners in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction or Climate Change Adaptation are not yet aware of the repercussions for disaster and vulnerability assessments. Emerging vulnerabilities are due to a growing dependency on digital services and tools in the case of a severe emergency or crisis. This article depicts the different implications for future theoretical frameworks when identifying novel semi-human groups and their vulnerabilities to disaster risks. Findings include assumed changes within common indicators of social vulnerability, new indicators, a typology of humans, and human interrelations with digital extensions and two different perspectives on these groups and their dependencies with critical infrastructure. © 2020 by the authors.

In recent years, ransomware attacks have resulted in critical data and financial losses to individuals and industries. These disruptions force the need for developing effective anti-ransomware methods in the research community. However, most of the existing techniques are designed to detect a specific ransomware variant instead of providing a generic solution mainly because of the obfuscation techniques used by ransomware or the use of static analysis methods. In this context, this paper proposes a novel ransomware-detection technique that identifies ransomware attacks by evaluating the current state of a computer system with knowledge of a ransomware attack. The finite-state machine model is used to synthesise the knowledge of the ransomware attack with respect to the victim machine. The proposed method monitors the changes happening in the computer system in terms of utilisation, persistence, and lateral movement of its resources to detect ransomware attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately detect attacks from different ransomware variants with significantly few false predictions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090566348

To make our digital systems and products more secure, all in IT need to know some cybersecurity - thus, there is a case for depth as well as breadth; this is not a new concern, but it is a growing one. Delivering cybersecurity effectively across general computer science programmes presents a number of challenges related to pedagogy, resources, faculty and infrastructure, as well as responding to industry requirements.Computer science and cognate engineering disciplines are evolving to meet these demands - both at school-level, as well as at university - however, doing so is not without challenges. This paper explores the progress made to date in the UK, building on previous work in cybersecurity education and accreditation by highlighting key challenges and opportunities, as well as identifying a number of enhancement activities for use by the international cybersecurity education community. It frames these challenges through concerns with the quality and availability of underpinning educational resources, the competencies and skills of faculty (especially focusing on pedagogy, progression and assessment), and articulating the necessary technical resources and infrastructure related to delivering rigorous cybersecurity content in general computer science and cognate degrees.Though this critical evaluation of an emerging national case study of cybersecurity education in the UK, we also present a number of recommendations across policy and practice - from pedagogic principles and developing effective cybersecurity teaching practice, challenges in the recruitment, retention and professional development of faculty, to supporting diverse routes into post-compulsory cybersecurity education (and thus, diverse careers) - to provide the foundation for potential replicability and portability to other jurisdictions contemplating related education and skills reform initiatives and interventions. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091416416

We use a rigorous stepwise regression analysis that includes polynomial and factorial multilevel effects of the independent variables.There are three significant findings. First, our model finds a significant relation between total data breach cost and revenue, the total amount of PII and SPII, and class action lawsuits.

Cybersecurity is of increasing importance in our interconnected world, yet the field has a growing workforce deficit and an underrepresentation of women and people of color. In an effort to address these issues, many digital games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping themselves, their data, and their networks safe. Intervention. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts. Methods. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity (either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and presentation of cybersecurity were gathered. Results. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer, mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of women and minoritized individuals in the field. Discussion. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening participation goals of the cybersecurity field. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086647364

The services provided include applications for mobile payment, ticketing, identification, access control, etc. While this makes modern smartwatches very powerful devices, it also makes them very attractive targets for attackers. Indeed, PINs and Pattern Lock have been widely used in smartwatches for user authentication. However, such authentication methods are not robust against various forms of cybersecurity attacks, such as side channel, phishing, smudge, shoulder surfing, and video-recording attacks. Moreover, the recent adoption of hardware-based solutions, like the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), can mitigate only partially such problems. Thus, the user's security and privacy are at risk without a strong authentication scheme in place. In this work, we propose 2GesturePIN, a new authentication framework that allows users to authenticate securely to their smartwatches and related sensitive services through solely two gestures. 2GesturePIN leverages the rotating bezel or crown, which are the most intuitive ways to interact with a smartwatch, as a dedicated hardware. 2GesturePIN improves the resilience of the regular PIN authentication method against state-of-the-art cybersecurity attacks while maintaining a high level of usability. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075469414

Various methods have been proposed to model the cybersecurity threats, but so far limited studies have been focused on the defensive strategies subject to the limited security budget. In this paper, the power supply reliability is evaluated considering the strategic allocation of defense resources. Specifically, the optimal mixed strategies are formulated by the Stackelberg Security Game (SSG) to allocate the defense resources on multiple targets subject to cyberattacks. The cyberattacks against the intrusion-tolerant Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system are mathematically modeled by Semi-Markov Process (SMP) kernel. The intrusion tolerance capability of the SCADA system provides buffered residence time before the substation failure to enhance the network robustness against cyberattacks. Case studies of the cyberattack scenarios are carried out to demonstrate the intrusion tolerance capability. Depending on the defense resource allocation scheme, the intrusion-tolerant SCADA system possesses varying degrees of self-healing capability to restore to the good state and prevent the substations from failure. If more defense resources are invested on the substations, the intrusion tolerant capability can be further enhanced for protecting the substations. Finally, the actuarial insurance principle is designed to estimate transmission companies' individual premiums considering correlated cybersecurity risks. The proposed insurance premium principle is designed to provide incentive for investments on enhancing the intrusion tolerance capability, which is verified by the results of case studies. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090122938

Although whaling largely consists of sending a simplistic email message to a whale (i.e. a high-value target in an organization), it can result in large payoffs for cybercriminals, in terms of money or data stolen from organizations. While a legitimate cybersecurity threat, little information security research has directed attention toward whaling. In this study, we begin to provide an initial understanding of what makes whaling such a pernicious problem for organizations, executives, or celebrities (e.g. whales), and those charged with protecting them. We do this by defining whaling, delineating it from general phishing and spear phishing, presenting real-world cases of whaling, and provide guidance on future information security research on whaling. We find that whaling is far more complex than general phishing and spear phishing, spans multiple domains (e.g. work and personal), and potentially results in spillover effects that ripple across the organization.

We first discuss three main categories of attacks against machine learning techniques—poisoning attacks, evasion attacks, and privacy attacks. Then the corresponding defense approaches are introduced along with the weakness and limitations of the existing defense approaches. We notice adversarial samples in cybersecurity and computer vision are fundamentally different. While adversarial samples in cybersecurity often have different properties/distributions compared with training data, adversarial images in computer vision are created with minor input perturbations. This further complicates the development of robust learning techniques, because a robust learning technique must withstand different types of attacks.

Unfortunately, many of the properties of ICS environments that contribute to the extent of this threat surface (e.g. age of devices, inability or unwillingness to patch, criticality of the system) similarly prevent the proper testing and evaluation of these security solutions. Production environments are often too fragile to introduce unvetted technology and most organizations lack test environments that are sufficiently consistent with production to yield actionable results. Cost and space requirements prevent the creation of mirrored physical environments leading many to look towards simulation or virtualization. Examples in literature provide various approaches to building ICS test beds, though most of these suffer from a lack of realism due to contrived scenarios, synthetic data and other compromises.

It is a complex system that comprises two independent parts: power grids and communication networks. There have been several cyber attacks on smart grid systems in recent years that have caused significant consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity training specific to the smart grid system is essential in order to handle these security issues adequately. Unfortunately, concepts related to automation, ICT, smart grids, and other physical sectors are typically not covered by conventional training and education methods. These cybersecurity experiences can be achieved by conducting training using a smart grid co-simulation, which is the integration of at least two simulation models. However, there has been little effort to research attack simulation tools for smart grids. In this research, we first review the existing research in the field, and then propose a smart grid attack co-simulation framework called GridAttackSim based on the combination of GridLAB-D, ns-3, and FNCS. The proposed architecture allows us to simulate smart grid infrastructure features with various cybersecurity attacks and then visualize their consequences automatically. Furthermore, the simulator not only features a set of built-in attack profiles but also enables scientists and electric utilities interested in improving smart grid security to design new ones. Case studies were conducted to validate the key functionalities of the proposed framework. The simulation results are supported by relevant works in the field, and the system can potentially be deployed for cybersecurity training and research. © 2020 by the authors.

The rationale was that over the last decade, studies have consistently shown that the human being remains the weakest link in the entire enterprise security chain. As a result, the majority of cyberattacks have resulted from human behaviour or error. Despite this, evidence suggests that many enterprises are still taking overly technocentric approaches to cybersecurity risk and this has increased the chances of missing the bigger picture. Thus, a mechanism to optimise both technical and non-technical security measures by identifying and closing socio-technical security gaps in existing enterprise security frameworks was required. The mechanism was derived from the literature and validated by industry practitioners where it was found that practitioners could categorise security controls into social (human included), technical and environmental dimensions. Through this, it was found that there were mainly non-technical (social and environmental dimensions) security gaps at practitioners’ organisations. To further demonstrate how this security challenge can be identified and addressed, a desktop application of the management process was carried out on the COBIT 5 for Information Security framework. The results reveal the non-technical security gaps on COBIT 5 and the management process demonstrates how these could be closed and optimised. The importance of this study is to highlight that taking overly technocentric approaches to enterprise security risk does not yield significantly positive results in protecting assets. A new approach is required and the socio-technical management process is this paper's contribution to address that security challenge. © 2020",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084682526

There is a lack of research on how the common elements of phishing emails, such as the presence of misspellings and the use of urgency and threatening language, influences how the email is processed and judged by individuals. Eye tracking technology may provide insight into this. In this exploratory study a sample of 22 participants viewed a series of emails with or without indicators associated with phishing emails, whilst their eye movements were recorded using a SMI RED 500 eye-tracker. Participants were also asked to give a numerical rating of how trustworthy they deemed each email to be. Overall, it was found that participants looked more frequently at the indicators associated with phishing than would be expected by chance but spent less overall time viewing these elements than would be expected by chance. The emails that included indicators associated with phishing were rated as less trustworthy on average, with the presence of misspellings or threatening language being associated with the lowest trustworthiness ratings. In addition, it was noted that phishing indicators relating to threatening language or urgency were viewed before misspellings. However, there was no significant interaction between the trustworthiness ratings of the emails and the amount of scanning time for phishing indicators within the emails. These results suggest that there is a complex relationship between the presence of indicators associated with phishing within an email and how trustworthy that email is judged to be. This study also demonstrates that eye tracking technology is a feasible method with which to identify and record how phishing emails are processed visually by individuals, which may contribute toward the design of future mitigation approaches. © Copyright © 2020 McAlaney and Hills.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089351677

Examining a sample of 504 U.S. higher-education institutions over a four-year period, we find that a university with centralized IT governance is associated with fewer breaches. Interestingly, the effect of centralized IT governance is contingent on the heterogeneity of a university’s computing environment: Universities with more heterogeneous IT infrastructure benefit more from centralized IT decision making. In addition, we find the relationship between centralized governance and cybersecurity breaches is most pronounced in public universities and those with more intensive research activities.

This study aims to explore how the 7Ps (product, price, promotion, place, physical evidence, process and people) marketing mix, as part of an internal social marketing approach, can be used to gain an understanding of employees’ interactions within an organization’s cybersecurity environment. This understanding could inform the design of servicescapes and behavioral infrastructure to promote and maintain cybersecurity compliance. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted an inductive qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with employees in several Vietnamese organizations. Discussions were centered on employee experiences and their perceptions of cybersecurity initiatives, as well as the impact of initiatives on compliance behavior. Responses were then categorized under the 7Ps marketing mix framework. Findings: The study shows that assessing a cybersecurity program using the 7P mix enables the systematic capture of users’ security compliance and acceptance of IT systems. Additionally, understanding the interactions between system elements permits the design of behavioral infrastructure to enhance security efforts. Results also show that user engagement is essential in developing secure systems. User engagement requires developing shared objectives, localized communications, co-designing of efficient processes and understanding the “pain points” of security compliance. The knowledge developed from this research provides a framework for those managing cybersecurity systems and enables the design human-centered systems conducive to compliance. Originality/value: The study is one of the first to use a cross-disciplinary social marketing approach to examine how employees experience and comply with security initiatives. Previous studies have mostly focused on determinants of compliance behavior without providing a clear platform for management action. Internal social marketing using 7Ps provides a simple but innovative approach to reexamine existing compliance approaches.

To prevent such malware, cybersecurity experts and researchers require datasets of malware samples that most available antivirus software programs cannot detect. However, researchers have infrequently discussed how to identify evolving Android malware characteristics from different sources. In this paper, we analyze a wide variety of Android malware datasets to determine more discriminative features such as permissions and intents. We then apply machine-learning techniques on collected samples of different datasets based on the acquired features’ similarity. We perform random sampling on each cluster of collected datasets to check the antivirus software’s capability to detect the sample. We also discuss some common pitfalls in selecting datasets.

As cyber insurance is still a new concept in practice and research, there are many unanswered questions regarding the data and economic models that drive it, the coverage options and pricing of premiums, and its more procedural policy-related aspects. This paper aims to address some of these questions by focusing on the key types of data which are used by cyber-insurance practitioners, particularly for decision-making in the insurance underwriting and claim processes. We further explore practitioners' perceptions of the challenges they face in gathering and using data, and identify gaps where further data is required. We draw our conclusions from a qualitative study by conducting a focus group with a range of cyber-insurance professionals (including underwriters, actuaries, claims specialists, breach responders, and cyber operations specialists) and provide valuable contributions to existing knowledge. These insights include examples of key data types which contribute to the calculation of premiums and decisions on claims, the identification of challenges and gaps at various stages of data gathering, and initial perspectives on the development of a pre-competitive dataset for the cyber insurance industry.

However, security concerns owing to the lack of control over the personal mobile devices of staff, which may contain sensitive data such as personal health information of patients, make it one of the biggest health care information technology (IT) challenges for hospital administrations. Objective: Given that the hospital BYOD security has not been adequately addressed in peer-reviewed literature, the aim of this paper was to identify key security challenges associated with hospital BYOD usage as well as relevant solutions that can cater to the identified issues by reviewing gray literature. Therefore, this research will provide additional practical insights from current BYOD practices. Methods: A comprehensive gray literature review was conducted, which followed the stepwise guidelines and quality assessment criteria set out by Garousi et al. The searched literature included tier 1 sources such as health care cybersecurity market reports, white papers, guidelines, policies, and frameworks as well as tier 2 sources such as credible and reputed health IT magazines, databases, and news articles. Moreover, a deductive thematic analysis was conducted to organize the findings based on Schlarman's People Policy Technology model, promoting a holistic understanding of hospitals' BYOD security issues and solutions. Results: A total of 51 sources were found to match the designed eligibility criteria. From these studies, several sociotechnical issues were identified. The major challenges identified were the use of devices with insufficient security controls by hospital staff, lack of control or visibility for the management to maintain security requirements, lack of awareness among hospital staff, lack of direction or guidance for BYOD usage, poor user experience, maintenance of legal requirements, shortage of cybersecurity skills, and loss of devices. Although technologies such as mobile device management, unified endpoint management, containerization, and virtual private network allow better BYOD security management in hospitals, policies and people management measures such as strong security culture and staff awareness and training improve staff commitment in protecting hospital data. Conclusions: The findings suggest that to optimize BYOD security management in hospitals, all 3 dimensions of the security process (people, policy, and technology) need to be given equal emphasis. As the nature of cybersecurity attacks is becoming more complex, all dimensions should work in close alignment with each other. This means that with the modernization of BYOD technology, BYOD strategy, governance, education, and relevant policies and procedures also need to adapt accordingly. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

Therefore, there is an urgent necessity of training students in the topic of cybersecurity, in which practical skills have to be acquired. In distance education, the inclusion of on-line resources for hands-on activities in its curricula is a key step in meeting that need. This work presents several contributions. First, the fundamentals of a virtual remote laboratory hosted in the cloud are detailed. This laboratory is a step forward since the laboratory combines both virtualization and cloud paradigms to dynamically create emulated environments. Second, this laboratory has also been integrated into the practical curricula of a cybersecurity subject, as an additional on-line resource. Third, the students’ traceability, in terms of their interactions with the laboratory, is also analyzed. Psychological TAM/UTAUT factors (perceived usefulness, estimated effort, social influence, attitude, ease of access) that may affect the intention of using the laboratory are analyzed. Fourth, the degree of satisfaction is analyzed with a great impact, since the mean values of these factors are most of them higher than 4 points out of 5. In addition to this, the students’ acceptance of the presented technology is exhaustively studied. Two structural equation models have been hypothesized and validated. Finally, the acceptance of the technology can be concluded as very good in order to be used in @? other Engineering contexts. In this sense, the calculated statistical values for the improved proposed model are within the expected ranges of reliability (X2 = 0.6, X2/DF = 0.3, GFI = 0.985, CIF = 0.985, RMSEA = 0) by considering the literature. © 2020 by the authors.

However, high data rate, low latency, low computational complexity, and privacy are some of the major bottlenecks to the successful deployment of such advanced hearing aids. To address these challenges, we propose an integration of 5G Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN), Internet of Things (IoT), and strong privacy algorithms to fully benefit from the possibilities these technologies have to offer. Existing audio-only hearing aids are known to perform poorly in noisy situations where overwhelming noise is present. Current devices make the signal more audible but remain deficient in restoring intelligibility. Thus, there is a need for hearing aids that can selectively amplify the attended talker or filter out acoustic clutter. The proposed 5G IoT-enabled AV hearing-aid framework transmits the encrypted compressed AV information and receives encrypted enhanced reconstructed speech in real time to address cybersecurity attacks such as location privacy and eavesdropping. For security implementation, a real-time lightweight AV encryption is proposed, based on a piece-wise linear chaotic map (PWLSM), Chebyshev map, and a secure hash and S-Box algorithm. For speech enhancement, the received secure AV (including lip-reading) information in the cloud is used to filter noisy audio using both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling. To offload the computational complexity and real-time optimization issues, the framework runs deep learning and big data optimization processes in the background, on the cloud. The effectiveness and security of the proposed 5G-IoT-enabled AV hearing-aid framework are extensively evaluated using widely known security metrics. Our newly reported, deep learning-driven lip-reading approach for speech enhancement is evaluated under four different dynamic real-world scenarios (cafe, street, public transport, pedestrian area) using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora. Comparative critical analysis in terms of both speech enhancement and AV encryption demonstrates the potential of the envisioned technology to deliver high-quality speech reconstruction and secure mobile AV hearing aid communication. We believe our proposed 5G IoT enabled AV hearing aid framework is an effective and feasible solution and represents a step change in the development of next-generation multimodal digital hearing aids. The ongoing and future work includes more extensive evaluation and comparison with benchmark lightweight encryption algorithms and hardware prototype implementation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075199081

While our findings suggest similarities in how both groups interpret the design parameters (e.g., red, skull, and fatal convey danger), we also uncovered potential concerns with items currently used as security indicators (e.g., both groups had mixed interpretations of the open lock and police officer symbols). Individual risk perception, particularly for children, appears dependent on personal preferences and experience. Our findings suggest implications and future research directions for the design of cybersecurity warnings for children. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091312697

The study presented in this article aimed to identify and prioritise network governance issues. Towards that purpose, qualitative and quantitative methods were applied in the analysis of norms and regulations, statutory documents of existing networks, academic sources and interviews with representatives of funding organisations and potential major customers. The comprehensiveness and complementarity of these primary sources allowed to identify 33 categories of governance issues and group them in four tiers, indicative of the respective priority level.

Many control applications require hard real-time channels, where the delay and jitter are in the levels of milliseconds or less. To the best of our knowledge, no encryption algorithm is fast enough for hard real-time channels of existing industrial fieldbuses and, therefore, made mission-critical applications vulnerable to cyberattacks, e.g., delay and data injection attacks. In this article, we propose a novel recursive watermark (RWM) algorithm for hard real-time control system data integrity validation. Using a watermark key, a transmitter applies watermark noise to hard real-time signals and sends through the unencrypted hard real-time channel. The same key is transferred to the receiver by the encrypted nonreal-time channel. With the same key, the receiver can detect if the data have been modified by the attackers and take action to prevent catastrophic damages. We provide analysis and methods to design proper watermark keys to ensure reliable attack detection. We use a ship propulsion control system for the simulation-based case study, where our algorithm smoothly shuts down the system after attacks. We also evaluated the algorithm speed on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller (PLC). This hardware experiment demonstrated that the RWM algorithm takes about 2.8~\mu \text{s} to add or validate the watermark noise on one sample data point. As a comparison, common cryptic hashing algorithms can hardly process a small data set under 100 ms. The proposed RWM is about 32 to 1375 times faster than the standard approaches. Note to Practitioners - It is widely believed that the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies will seamlessly connect countless smart devices, profoundly change the industry. Traditionally, field devices within the feedback control loops are isolated from the Internet by secure gateways. In the future, field devices will connect to the Internet in a more direct manner. To the best of our knowledge, no encryption algorithm is fast enough for hard real-time channels of existing industrial fieldbuses and, therefore, made mission-critical applications vulnerable to cyberattacks. We propose a novel recursive watermark (RWM) algorithm for hard real-time control system data integrity validation. This article serves industry practitioners in three ways. First, it is a timely caution to industrial IoT (IIoT) pilot users on the security challenges in real-time channels. Once a compromised edge device is connected to a field device, attackers have unlimited means to jeopardize valuable assets. In this article, we gave an example where attackers may damage shipboard assets by introducing millisecond-level delays. Second, since hard real-time encryption is not available, we propose a detour solution. With the proposed algorithm, even attackers may read the content in the real-time channel, and they cannot change it without being detected. We implemented the real-time RWM algorithms in structured control language (SCL) and tested on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller (PLC). Third, we provide theoretical analysis as design guidelines for practitioners to set up or customize the RWM algorithm per their specific applications. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083223892

We argue that click rates should be expected to vary based on the difficulty of the phishing email for a target audience. Past research has shown that when the premise of a phishing email aligns with a user’s work context, it is much more challenging for users to detect a phish. Given this, we propose a Phish Scale, so CISOs and phishing training implementers can easily rate the difficulty of their phishing exercises and help explain associated click rates.

Both forms use the data communications between Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I/I2V) and other on-road entities, and are accelerating the adoption of self-driving cars. The development of cyber-physical systems containing advanced sensors, sub-systems, and smart driving assistance applications over the past decade is equipping unmanned aerial and road vehicles with autonomous decision-making capabilities. The level of autonomy depends upon the make-up and degree of sensor sophistication and the vehicle's operational applications. As a result, self-driving cars are being compromised perceived as a serious threat. Therefore, analyzing the threats and attacks on self-driving cars and ITSs, and their corresponding countermeasures to reduce those threats and attacks are needed. For this reason, some survey papers compiling potential attacks on VANETs, ITSs and self-driving cars, and their detection mechanisms are available in the current literature. However, up to our knowledge, they have not covered the real attacks already happened in self-driving cars. To bridge this research gap, in this paper, we analyze the attacks that already targeted self-driving cars and extensively present potential cyber-Attacks and their impacts on those cars along with their vulnerabilities. For recently reported attacks, we describe the possible mitigation strategies taken by the manufacturers and governments. This survey includes recent works on how a self-driving car can ensure resilient operation even under ongoing cyber-Attack. We also provide further research directions to improve the security issues associated with self-driving cars. © 2013 IEEE.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097393874

At the same time, the rise in the number of internet of things (IoT) objectives poses considerable cybersecurity issues owing to the latest rise in the existence of attacks. Presently, the development of deep learning and hardware technologies offers a way to detect the present traffic condition, data offloading, and cyber-attacks in edge networks. The utilization of DL models finds helpful in several domains in which the MEC provides the decisive beneficiary of the approach for traffic prediction and attack detection since a large quantity of data generated by IoT devices enables deep models to learn better than shallow approaches. In this view, this paper presents a new DL based traffic prediction with a data offloading mechanism with cyber-attack detection (DLTPDO-CD) technique. The proposed model involves three major processes traffic prediction, data offloading, and attack detection. Initially, bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) based traffic prediction to enable the proficient data offloading process. Then, the adaptive sampling cross entropy (ASCE) technique is executed to maximize the network throughput by making decisions related to offloading users to the WiFi system. Finally, a deep belief network (DBN) optimized by a barnacles mating optimizer (BMO) algorithm called BMO-DBN is applied as a detection tool for cyberattacks in MEC. Extensive simulation is carried out to ensure the proficient performance of the DLTPDO-CD model.

It analyzes and predicts attacks that have occurred and have not occurred, and plays an important role in building an efficient defense system. Traditional threat intelligence relies on a manual collection and its efficiency is relatively low. Therefore, the efficient sharing of threat intelligence has important research value. For the information extraction technology of threat intelligence, we focus on the construction of threat intelligence labeling data sets and the extraction technology of threat intelligence relationship. The specific content and research results include two aspects: (1) Research on the construction of threat intelligence information extraction data set. The threat intelligence extraction data set is constructed by a distantly supervised labeling method. In this paper, more than 900 threat intelligence reports are used as a corpus. We finally obtain a relation extraction data set containing 10,000 sentence instances of 30 relationships. (2) Research on the extraction of threat intelligence relationships.

The most complex type of cyberthreat is the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack that is usually backed by one or more states and lunched using a range of clandestine techniques aiming at high-value targets. Finding the source of the attackers and the associated campaign behind the threats can lead to taking an optimum defense decision in a more timely fashion. Threat attribution is an act of attributing an attack to the source of the attack. Threat attribution can not be fully achieved by a single piece of evidence (i.e. single view) from malicious actors as the evidence could get obfuscated by the actor to evade the detection mechanism. In this article, we propose a multi-view fuzzy consensus clustering model for attributing cyber threat payloads (malware) to its actor. We conduct over 4000 experiments to find out the best combinations of all 12 extracted views for the attribution task. Our experiments use five well-know APT families payloads. To avoid bias in the results, we apply a fuzzy pattern tree and multi-modal fuzzy classifier for our inference engines of all views. To define an optimum distinction among the malicious actor's behavior we implemented the consensus clustering technique. The comparison analysis of a single-view versus multi-view result justifies a significant improvement in the accuracy rate of attribution for all actors. The obtained results from the multi-view aspect of our proposed model give 95.2% accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089604815

Answers were provided by 2,229 teachers from all over the country belonging to primary and secondary schools, participating in a national project whose goal is to spread computer science and to sensitize students to a proper use of digital technologies. The results confirm the high sensitivity of teachers towards digital awareness issues. Indeed, students should be prepared to recognize risks when they use digital technologies: not only cyberbullying, they should pay more attention to the protection of their personal data, and to the reliability of news on social media. Moreover, teachers declare the need for themselves to receive specific training on digital awareness, and to be supported in their activities. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088502465

In particular, the manufacturing industry seeks to advance information and communication technology (ICT) to build a smart factory that integrates the management of production processes, safety, procurement, and logistics services. Such smart factories can effectively solve the problem of frequent occurrences of accidents and high fault rates. An increasing number of cases happening in smart factories due to botnet DDoS attacks have been reported in recent times. Hence, the Internet of Thing security is of paramount importance in this emerging field of network security improvement. In response to the cyberattacks, smart factory security needs to gain its defending ability against botnet. Various security solutions have been proposed as solutions. However, those emerging approaches to IoT security are yet to effectively deal with IoT malware, also known as Zero-day Attacks. Botnet detection using honeypot has been recently studied in a few researches and shows its potential to detect Botnet in some applications effectively. Detecting botnet by honeypot is a detection method in which a resource is intentionally created within a network as a trap to attract botnet attackers with the purpose of closely monitoring and obtaining their behaviors. By doing this, the tracked contents are recorded in a log file. It is then used for analysis by machine learning. As a result, responding actions are generated to act against the botnet attack. In this work, a review of literature looks insight into two main areas, i.e. 1) Botnet and its severity in cybersecurity, 2) Botnet attacks on a smart factory and the potential of the honeypot approach as an effective solution. Notably, a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of honeypot detection in various applications is accomplished and the application of honey in the smart factories is reviewed. © Science and Information Organization.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087814839

The traditional deterministic game model cannot accurately describe the process of actual network attack and defense due to changing in the set of attack-defense strategies and external factors (such as the operating environment of the system). In this paper, we construct a stochastic evolutionary game model by the stochastic differential equation with Markov property. The evolutionary equilibrium solution of the model is found and the stability of the model is proved according to the knowledge of the stochastic differential equation. And we apply the explicit Euler numerical method to analyze the evolution of the strategy selection of the players for different problem situations. The simulation results show that the stochastic evolutionary game model proposed in this paper can get a steady state and obtain the optimal defense strategy under the action of the stochastic disturbance factor. In addition, compared with other kinds of literature, we can conclude that the return on security investment of this model is better, and the strategy selection of the attackers and defenders in our model is more suitable for actual network attack and defense. © 2020 Xiaotong Xu et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087275118

AEs are trained on the assumption that abnormal inputs will produce higher reconstruction errors than normal ones. In practice, however, this assumption is unreliable in the unsupervised case, where the training data may contain anomalous examples. Given sufficient capacity and training time, an AE can generalize to such an extent that it reliably reconstructs anomalies. Consequently, the ability to distinguish anomalies via reconstruction errors is diminished. We respond to this limitation by introducing three new methods to more reliably train AEs for unsupervised anomaly detection: cumulative error scoring (CES), percentile loss (PL), and early stopping via knee detection.

At the same time, a concern arises about the levels of Internet addiction in the population. In turn, levels of Internet addiction are a current problem in modern societies that has been linked to low self-control. This paper aims to analyse the degree to which images are published and the reasons why the adult segment of the population practices sharenting, to determine the socio-demographic factors that have an impact on sharenting, Internet addiction and self-control, and to establish the correlations between these three variables.

These findings were integrated with our previous research on MMA reimbursement and regulation to create a module that could be used with existing health technology assessment (HTA) methodological frameworks to guide the evaluation of MMAs.Results Stakeholders indicated that they trust how traditional medical devices are currently appraised for reimbursement. They were concerned that there was a lack of clarity regarding which entity in the health system was responsible for determining app quality. They were also concerned about the digital health literacy of medical practitioners and patients. Concepts emerging from our previous research were reinforced by the interview findings, including that the connectivity and cybersecurity of apps need to be considered, along with an assessment of software reliability. It is also critical that the credibility of the information presented in apps is assessed as it could potentially mislead patients and clinicians.Conclusion An MMA evaluation module was created that would enable an existing HTA process to be adapted for the assessment of MMA technology.

Malicious attackers can create massive Sybils and further utilize those fake identities to launch various Sybil attacks. Therefore, Sybil detection in OSNs has become an urgent security research problem for both academia and industries. The existing content-based methods to detect Sybils base on the combination of manual-design features and machine learning algorithms, which requires lots of professional experiences and human effort. These methods divide the Sybil detection problem into two piece-wise sub-problems, which prevents us from getting the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel content-based method to detect Sybils. The proposed method is an end-to-end classification model that extracts features directly from the input data, and then output the classification results in a unified framework. The proposed method includes three main parts: first, the self-normalizing convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to extract lower features from the multi-dimensional input data; second, the bidirectional self-normalizing LSTM network (bi-SN-LSTM) is developed to extract higher features from the compressed feature map sequence; third, the dense layer and softmax classifier are stacked to output the classification results. Unlike the traditional bidirectional long short-term memory network (bi-LSTM), the proposed bi-SN-LSTM network utilizes SELU as the activation function of its recurrent step, which provides unbounded changes to the state value.

In this paper, we propose a novel system that addresses these two problems, titled CAMLPAD, for Cybersecurity Autonomous Machine Learning Platform for Anomaly Detection. The CAMLPAD system’s streamlined, holistic approach begins with retrieving a multitude of different species of cybersecurity data in real-time using elasticsearch, then running several machine learning algorithms, namely Isolation Forest, Histogram-Based Outlier Score (HBOS), Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), and K-Means Clustering, to process the data. Next, the calculated anomalies are visualized using Kibana and are assigned an outlier score, which serves as an indicator for whether an alert should be sent to the system administrator that there are potential anomalies in the network. After comprehensive testing of our platform in a simulated environment, the CAMLPAD system achieved an adjusted rand score of 95%, exhibiting the reliable accuracy and precision of the system.

It benefits from a shared set of configurable resources without limitations of local data storage infrastructures. However, it brings several cybersecurity issues. In this work, we address the methods of mitigating risks of confidentiality, integrity, availability, information leakage associated with the information loss/change, technical failures, and denial of access. We rely on a configurable secret sharing scheme and error correction codes based on the Redundant Residue Number System (RRNS). To dynamically configure RRNS parameters to cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and cloud properties, we take into account several conflicting objectives: probability of information loss/change, extraction time, and data redundancy. We propose an approach based on a genetic algorithm that is effective for multi-objective optimization. We implement NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOCell, using the JMetal 5.6 framework. We provide their experimental analysis using eleven real data cloud storage providers. We show that MOCell algorithm demonstrates best results obtaining a better Pareto optimal front approximation and quality indicators such as inverted generational distance, additive epsilon indicator, and hypervolume.

A model is described for the subsystem of fuzzy inference (FI). Based on the FI rules for input values that can be obtained from sensors, multi-agent systems, SIEM sensors that detect the presence of threats, cyberattacks, anomalies, it is suggested to determine the output values for estimating the protection degree of critical computer systems (CCS) using DSS. The model assumes that the input values for the FI subsystem were obtained as a result of the fuzzification procedure in the corresponding module. Each element of the output values characterizes the presence or absence of a sign of unforeseen situations associated with anomalies, attacks or other attempts to interfere with the work of the CCS without authorization. An algorithm is proposed for forming a knowledge base of unforeseen (emergency) and typical situations in CCS. The algorithm differs from the known ones in that it made it possible to form a set of cases of typical responses to threats, anomalies and attacks in CCS, as well as rules for the output for authentication of unforeseen situations which are primarily associated with a targeted destructive impact on CCS. The use of the “fuzzy logic output” module allows one to display the state of the most vulnerable components of CCS as a multiparameter “image”. The obtained multiparameter “image” can be applied in DSS for a qualitative assessment of the security of CCS. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064538730

The global outlook will present the basis for examining best practices that the UAE could emulate. The paper will then examine the legislative landscape of cyber laws in the UAE, including cross-country comparisons. The comparisons are critical, as the country’s cybercrime laws are in their infancy phase. Findings: The UAE has taken decisive and proactive measures to deter the threat of cybercrimes and cyberattacks. The UAE strategy comprehensive strategy has been effective in protecting the economy and populations from the adverse effects of cybercrimes. The success lies in the enactment of comprehensive and streamlines laws and regulations with harsher penalties. The stringent legal measures, including longer jail terms, stiffer fines and deportation of foreigners, have ensured robust deterrence to cybercriminals. Originality/value: The analysis has shown that the UAE has a higher score of preparedness against cybercrimes and cyberattacks.

Do investors sacrifice return for pursuing ESG-aligned megatrend goals? The study analyses the risk-adjusted financial performance of ESG-themed megatrend investment strategies in global equity markets. The analysis covers nine themes for the period 2015–2019: environmental megatrends covering energy efficiency, food security, and water scarcity; social megatrends covering ageing, millennials, and urbanisation; governance megatrends covered by cybersecurity, disruptive technologies, and robotics. We construct megatrend factor portfolios based on signalling theory and formulate a novel measure for stock megatrend exposure (MTE), based on the relative fund flows into the corresponding thematic ETFs. We apply pure factor portfolios methodology based on constrained WLS cross-sectional regressions to calculate Fama-French factor returns. Time-series regression rests on the generalised method of moments estimator (GMM) that uses robust distance instruments. Our findings show that each environmental megatrend, as well as the disruptive technologies megatrend, yielded positive and significant alphas relative to the passive strategy, although this outperformance becomes statistically insignificant in the Fama-French 5-factor model context. The important result is that most of the megatrend factor portfolios yielded significant non-negative alphas; which supports our assumption that megatrend investing strategy promotes SDGs while not sacrificing returns, even when accounting for transaction costs up to 50bps/annum. Higher transaction costs, as is the case for some of these ETFs with expense ratios reaching 80-100bps, may be an indication of two things: ESG-themed megatrend investors were willing to sacrifice ca. 30-50bps of annual return to remain aligned with sustainability targets, or that expense ratio may well decline in the future. © 2020 Naffa, Fain.

That decision is the core of an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a component responsible for raising alerts whenever a potential threat is detected. However, with high volume data in contemporary systems, these IDSs generate numerous alerts, too large for human operators to exhaustively investigate. Moreover, simply reporting a single possible threat is often not sufficient, since the security analyst has to investigate the alert without any further clues of the underlying cause. In order to combat these issues, we empirically compare popular deep neural learning architectures for the problem of intrusion detection in sequential data streams. Contrary to a majority of research studies, we do not take a classification-based approach that requires labeled examples of hostile attacks. Instead, we adopt an unsupervised anomaly detection approach that aims to model a benign sequential data distribution against which new test instances are compared to. We also examine one additional deep network in the form of an attention model capable of providing explanations in addition to its predictions; such information is of crucial importance to network operators since it provides additional guidance to resolve potential threats. For our experiments, we evaluate the models against a variety of data sets of different complexities, ranging from simple unidimensional (synthetic and Yahoo!) to more complex multi-source (CICIDS2017 and small real-world enterprise network) data streams. In order to facilitate end-user needs, we focus on ranking-based metrics for comparing different deep neural architectures. This evaluation is especially important for security analysts to prioritize their anomaly investigations. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that a variant of a recurrent neural network generally outperforms a popular non-sequential deep autoencoder commonly used for unsupervised anomaly detection. The attentional model did not provide sufficiently good performance and explanations that we discuss in our analysis. Nonetheless, given that the global financial outlays for cybersecurity are calculated in trillions of dollars, our evaluation and identification of the top-performing RNN architectures for anomaly detection in sequential data streams can lead to improved intelligent IDS design, while our contributions of attentional explanation will hopefully lay the foundations for future improvements to the explanatory capability of these intelligent learning-based IDSs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086503001

Therefore, the detection and prediction of cyber-attacks are very important for every organization that is dealing with sensitive data for business purposes. In this paper, we present a framework on cyber security using a data mining technique to predict cyber-attacks that can be helpful to take proper interventions to reduce the cyber-attacks. The two main components of the framework are the detection and prediction of cyber-attacks. The framework first extracts the patterns related to cyber-attacks from historical data using a J48 decision tree algorithm and then builds a prediction model to predict the future cyber-attacks. We then apply the framework on publicly available cyber security datasets provided by the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity. In the datasets, several kinds of cyber-attacks are presented including DDoS, Port Scan, Bot, Brute force, SQL Injection, and Heartbleed. The proposed framework correctly detects the cyber-attacks and provides the patterns related to cyber-attacks. The overall accuracy of the proposed prediction model to detect cyber-attacks is around 99%. The extracted patterns of the prediction model on historical data can be applied to predict any future cyber-attacks. The experimental results of the prediction model indicate the superiority of the model to detect any future cyber-attacks. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097547624

While training individuals on best practices in cybersecurity continues to be implemented, prior research has found that training people in the use of secure passwords has not proven to be effective. Developing profiles of individual who are likely to become victims of password hacking, phishing scams, and other types of breaches would be useful, as they could be used to identify individuals with the highest likelihood of engaging in insecure cybersecurity behaviors. The present research tested the hypothesis that in addition to self-reported cybersecurity knowledge, personal characteristics, such as personality traits and general risk-taking behavior not related to technology use, can predict individual differences in cybersecurity behaviors, as measured by self-report. Our hypothesis was confirmed in a large study involving 325 undergraduates. Participants provided information about their self-reported risky cybersecurity behaviors (e.g., using non-secure Wi-Fi, not logging out of accounts on shared computers, etc.), self-reported knowledge about strong/weak passwords, Big Five personality traits (i.e., extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and mood instability), sensation-seeking personality traits, and general risk-taking unrelated to using technology. The results of a hierarchical regression indicated that 34% of risky cybersecurity behavior was significantly predicted by the combination of self-reported knowledge about strong/weak passwords, personality traits, and risk-taking in daily life. The results suggest that victim profiles should take into account individual differences in personality and general risk-taking in domains unrelated to cybersecurity in addition to cybersecurity knowledge. © Copyright © 2020 Kennison and Chan-Tin.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096158315

In practice, well established set-theoretic similarity measures, such as the Jaccard and Sorensen-Dice measures, are commonly used, whereas axiomatically, a wide breadth of possible measures have been theoretically explored. This article identifies, articulates, and addresses an inherent and so far not discussed limitation of popular measures - their tendency to be subject to aliasing - where they return the same similarity value for very different sets of intervals. The latter risks counter-intuitive results and poor-automated reasoning in real-world applications dependent on systematically comparing interval-valued system variables or states. Given this, we introduce new axioms establishing desirable properties for robust similarity measures, followed by putting forward a novel set-theoretic similarity measure based on the concept of bidirectional subsethood, which satisfies both traditional and new axioms. The proposed measure is designed to be sensitive to the variation in the size of intervals, thus avoiding aliasing. This article provides a detailed theoretical exploration of the new proposed measure, and systematically demonstrates its behavior using an extensive set of synthetic and real-world data. Specifically, the measure is shown to return robust outputs that follow intuition - essential for real-world applications. For example, we show that it is bounded above and below by the Jaccard and Sorensen-Dice similarity measures (when the minimum t-norm is used). Finally, we show that a dissimilarity or distance measure, which satisfies the properties of a metric, can easily be derived from the proposed similarity measure. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086247204

The objective of this research is to reduce cyber risks and vulnerabilities and to improve the cybersecurity capabilities of railways by evaluating their cybersecurity maturity levels and making recommendations for improvements. After assessing various cybersecurity maturity models, the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) was selected to assess the cybersecurity capabilities of railway organizations. The contributions of this research are as follows. First, a new maturity level MIL4 (Maturity Indicator Level 4) is introduced in the C2M2 model. Second, the C2M2 model is adapted by adding advanced security analytics and threat intelligence to develop the Railway-Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (R-C2M2). The cybersecurity maturity of three railway organizations is evaluated using this model. Third, recommendations and available standards & guidelines are provided to the three railway organizations to improve maturity levels within different domains. In addition, they are given an action plan to implement the recommendations in a streamlined way. The application of this model will allow railway organizations to improve their capability to reduce the impacts of cyber-attacks and eradicate vulnerabilities.

Therefore, this paper focuses on anomaly-based detection of malicious behavior on the network by using flow-based features. Four unsupervised methods are evaluated of which two employ a self-supervised learning approach.

These QR-CPS testbed environments provide a realistic platform for conducting the Grid Exercise (GridEx), CPS security training, and attack-defense exercise at a broader scale for the cybersecurity of Energy Delivery Systems. The NERC has established a tabletop based GridEx platform for the North American power utilities to demonstrate how they would respond to and recover from cyber threats and incidents. The NERC-GridEx is a bi-annual activity with tabletop attack injects and incidence response management. There is a significant need to build a testbed-based hands-on GridEx for the utilities by leveraging the CPS testbeds, which imitates the pragmatic CPS grid environment. We propose a CPS testbed-based Quasi-Realistic Grid Exercise (QR-GridEx), which is a model after the NERC's tabletop GridEx. We have designed the CPS testbed-based QR-GridEx into two parts. Part-I focuses on the modeling of synthetic grid models for the utilities, including SCADA and WAMS communications, and attack-and-defense software systems; and the Part-II focuses on the incident response management and risk-based CPS grid investment strategies. This paper presents the Part-I of the CPS testbed-based QRGridEx, which includes modeling of the synthetic grid models in the real-time digital simulator, stealthy, and coordinated cyberattack vectors, and integration of intrusion/anomaly detection systems. We have used our existing HIL CPS security testbed to demonstrate the testbed-based QR-GridEx for a Texas-2000 bus US synthetic grid model and the IEEE-39 bus grid models. The experiments demonstrated significant results by 100% real-time performance with zero overruns for grid impact characteristics against stealthy and coordinated cyberattack vectors. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096924945

Analogue systems have to be replaced by digital means to optimize spectrum efficiency and automation is becoming much more important to be able to handle the amount of participants in the air traffic system. As safety and security are strongly intertwined in aviation, cybersecurity is one key enabler for digitalization in civil aviation. As such we investigate mutual authentication and key agreement methods for the digital aeronautical ground-based communications system L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (LDACS). Thereby, we compare the suitability of three different Diffie-Hellmann (DH) key exchange flavors used in a modified version of the Station-To-Station (STS) protocol, for digital aeronautical communication in terms of latency and security data overhead. We conclude, the STS protocol based on a central Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) trust solution with Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) for post-quantum security to be best suited for long term security. However, due to the smaller key sizes, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is the more resource efficient candidate and may play a role in low resource authentication scenarios for LDACS. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097974683

Attention is paid to such a significant disadvantage of ADS-B equipment, which uses the 1090 ES transmission line, as low cybersecurity. It is shown that to eliminate this disadvantage the verification of the aircraft surveillance data is necessary. The ADS-B data are supposed to be verified based by comparing them with the data of a radio system consisting of several bistatic cells. Each cell is a passive bistatic radar. The source of the signal in each cell is the digital television broadcasting transmitter of the DVB-T2 standard. The mathematical and geometric formulation of the problem is given. Analytical expressions are obtained for evaluating such important characteristics of the radar as spatial resolution of targets with respect to azimuth and elevation, resolution with respect to range. In addition, the accuracy indicators for determining the spatial position of the target are found. A fast technique for approximate estimation of the size of the working area of the radar consisting of two bistatic cells is proposed.

It is widely used in organizations for configuration management and task automation but is also increasingly used for launching cyber attacks against organizations, mainly because it is pre-installed on Windows machines and exposes strong functionality that may be leveraged by attackers. This makes the problem of detecting malicious PowerShell code both urgent and challenging. Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), built into Windows 10, allows defending systems to scan all the code passed to scripting engines such as PowerShell prior to its execution. In this work, we conduct the first study of malicious PowerShell code detection using the information made available by AMSI. We present several novel deep-learning based detectors of malicious PowerShell code that employ pretrained contextual embeddings of words from the PowerShell ""language"". A contextual word embedding is able to project semantically-similar words to proximate vectors in the embedding space. A known problem in the cybersecurity domain is that labeled data is relatively scarce, in comparison with unlabeled data, making it difficult to devise effective supervised detection of malicious activity of many types. This is also the case with PowerShell code. Our work shows that this problem can be mitigated by learning a pretrained contextual embedding based on unlabeled data. We trained and evaluated our models using real-world data, collected using AMSI. The contextual embedding was learnt using a large corpus of unlabeled PowerShell scripts and modules collected from public repositories. Our performance analysis establishes that the use of unlabeled data for the embedding significantly improved the performance of our detectors. Our best-performing model uses an architecture that enables the processing of textual signals from both the character and token levels and obtains a true-positive rate of nearly 90% while maintaining a low false-positive rate of less than 0.1%. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096385568

However, the accompanying cybersecurity risks, such as environmental attacks and software attacks, must not be ignored. Thus, the security problem in recommender systems becomes a serious challenge for cloud-based IoT services. Moreover, most of existing collaborative recommendation algorithms mainly focus on user-item interaction relationships but seldom consider user-user or item-item co-occurrence relationships, which may affect prediction accuracy. To overcome the above shortcomings, this paper proposes a security-driven hybrid collaborative recommendation method to deal with the large-scale IoT services accessible by clouds in a more scalable and secure manner. Our proposal integrates the factorization-based latent factor model with the neighbor-based collaborative model to mine not only user-service interaction relationships but also user-user and service-service co-occurrence relationships. Moreover, the local sensitive hash (LSH) technique is adopted to speed up the neighbor searching and preserve users’ sensitive information for security concerns based on hash mapping.

The problem is that many IIoT/Industry 4.0 devices have been connected to the Internet without considering the implementation of proper security measures, thus existing many examples of misconfigured or weakly protected devices. Securing such systems requires very specific skills, which, unfortunately, are not taught extensively in engineering schools. This article details how Industry 4.0 and IIoT cybersecurity can be learned through practical use cases, making use of a methodology that allows for carrying out audits to students that have no previous experience in IIoT or industrial cybersecurity. The described teaching approach is blended and has been imparted at the University of A Coruna (Spain) during the last years, even during the first semester of 2020, when the university was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Such an approach is supported by online tools like Shodan, which ease the detection of vulnerable IIoT devices. The feedback results provided by the students show that they consider useful the proposed methodology, which allowed them to find that 13% of the IIoT/Industry 4.0 systems they analyzed could be accessed really easily. In addition, the obtained teaching results indicate that the established course learning outcomes are accomplished. Therefore, this article provides useful guidelines for teaching industrial cybersecurity and thus train the next generation of security researchers and developers. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089837867

To this end, advanced techniques are required to mitigate the impact of the potential attacks. In this paper, we investigate the use of honeypots, which are considered to mimic the common services of the smart grid and are able to detect unauthorized accesses, collect evidence, and help hide the real devices. More specifically, the interaction of an attacker and a defender is considered, who both optimize the number of attacks and the defending system configuration, i.e., the number of real devices and honeypots, respectively, with the aim to maximize their individual payoffs. To solve this problem, game theoretic tools are used, considering an one-shot game and a repeated game with uncertainty about the payoff of the attacker, where the Nash Equilibrium (NE) and the Bayesian NE are derived, respectively.

Analysts must guarantee access to information on the most up-to-date cybersecurity events and threats. This monitoring process is often the job of a security information and event management system, which relies on the timeliness and relevance of its feeds. There has been growing interest in exploiting open source intelligence for this purpose, mainly due to its timeliness and volume. Social media sites such as Twitter, are capable of aggregating numerous cybersecurity-related sources and act as a stream of information that can be used to feed a cyberthreat intelligence platform. In this paper, we present a multi-task learning approach combining two Natural Language Processing tasks for cyberthreat intelligence. Our pipeline is capable of reading a stream of tweets from a set of Twitter accounts and, through a shared deep neural network architecture, simultaneously identify relevant cybersecurity-related content and extract indicators of compromise therein. We show that in comparison to the traditional independent tasks baseline, one of the tasks achieves a slight F1 score improvement, while the other task is able to maintain its performance. Thus, the proposed approach greatly simplifies the pipeline and the requirements for data and online model adaptation over time, without sacrificing functional performance. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091565116

To investigate how AI and cybersecurity should be taught together, we look at previous studies on cybersecurity MOOCs by conducting a systematic literature review. The initial search resulted in 72 items and after screening for only peer-reviewed publications on cybersecurity online courses, 15 studies remained. Three of the studies concerned multiple cybersecurity MOOCs whereas 12 focused on individual courses. The number of published work evaluating specific cybersecurity MOOCs was found to be small compared to all available cybersecurity MOOCs. Analysis of the studies revealed that cybersecurity education is, in almost all cases, organised based on the topic instead of used tools, making it difficult for learners to find focused information on AI applications in cybersecurity.

The attacks perpetrated by internal sources are also referred to as insider threats.

In this paper, we propose an approach for insider threat classification which is motivated by the effectiveness of pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for image classification. In the proposed approach, we extract features from usage patterns of insiders and represent these features as images. Hence, images are used to represent the resource access patterns of the employees within an organization. After construction of images, we use pre-trained DCNNs for anomaly detection, with the aim to identify malicious insiders. Random under sampling is used for reducing the class imbalance issue. The proposed approach is evaluated using the MobileNetV2, VGG19, and ResNet50 pre-trained models, and a benchmark dataset.

We argue that firms experiencing such technological failures interpret them broadly as organizational problems, and undertake unrelated divestitures and top management turnover to achieve better standardization and to remove dysfunctional routines. We test our hypotheses on unrelated subsidiary divestitures and chief technology officer (CTO) turnovers undertaken by 8,760 publicly traded U.S. firms that were at risk of experiencing data breaches involving the loss of personally identifiable information during the period 2005-2016. We find that data breaches significantly increase the hazard of unrelated divestitures and CTO turnover, and that these failure responses are sensitive to firms' aspiration-performance feedback. However, whereas unrelated divestitures reduce the reoccurrence of data breaches, CTO turnover has no significant effect. Our findings suggest a corrective role of unrelated divestitures for failure learning, and the symbolic nature of CTO turnover as a failure response. Our study unpacks failure learning that hitherto has been inferred from a firm's own failure experience and industry-wide failures, and highlights the interplay between the digital and nondigital components of a firm in the understudied context of data breaches.

ICT components include not only Internet of Things (IoT) data sources spread across the city, but also traditional non-IoT data sources. Managing all ICT components in a smart city can be challenging and results in many complexities. Consequently, there is a need for ICT management architectures. Traditional solutions are often based on a centralized ICT architecture using Cloud technologies. Recently, the number of ICT components, services, and their corresponding complexities are growing, leading to large-scale ICT architectures. Centralized Cloud solutions cannot cope with the ever-expanding demands of this kind of architectures. The limitations of the centralized approaches necessitate the design of a new ICT architecture, using distributed technologies, for every layer and element of the city. Many solutions for management from Edge-To-Cloud (E2C) through distributed technologies are forthcoming, including Decentralized-To-Centralized ICT (DC2C-ICT) and Distributed-To-Centralized ICT (D2C-ICT) architectures. The DC2C-ICT architecture and its components work on their own tasks and are solely communicating with a centralized platform. On the other hand, components of the D2C-ICT architecture can work together to provide the services for the citizens across different layers from E2C. Therefore, the D2CICT architecture is less dependent on the central Cloud-based entity, but harder to design and manage. In this paper, an 'Edge-To-Cloud-As-A-Service (E2CaaS) ' model is proposed together with a model on how to build efficient software services in smart cities through different layers of E2C.

The platform allows for evaluating the performance of new control algorithms and understanding dynamics of modern distribution grids. Example case studies are presented to validate the proposed platform. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089424384

Canada, however, is an exception. Despite the prevalence of voting technologies in Canada's local elections, notably online voting, no regulation framework has been initiated. In particular, there are no guidelines or standards surrounding the use of online voting. While research documents online voting has positive effects for participation, implications for the integrity, accountability, and transparency of elections are stark. Canada's multilevel governance structure has meant municipalities mostly deliver elections on their own terms, resulting in a patchwork of online voting models and cybersecurity requirements. Many municipalities also lack the resources to vet vendor solutions adequately, and an increasing number of cities are eliminating paper voting. These conditions highlight an urgent need to regulate the design and procurement of election technology in Canada. To proactively respond to these developments, this article draws upon interviews with select officials and experts and regulation models in other jurisdictions to argue for a new model of electronic voting regulation that would be a good fit for Canada. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088695177

Especially, the use of standardized data objects and message structures stipulated by IEC 61850 makes them much more vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation. In order to tackle these vulnerabilities, different methods are investigated by researchers all over the world. An important aspect of such efforts is the real-time performance consideration since power systems are bound by the rules of physics and all control/communication tasks need to be completed in a certain time frame. Security schemes for substation communication have been proposed in the recent literature. However, they must be improved to ensure a full security solution. Recently published IEC 62351 standard aims to fill this gap. Node authentication is vital for substation communication networks based on IEC 61850 to mitigate a variety of attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This short communication presents a node authentication mechanism based on transport layer security (TLS) with certificates to address this knowledge gap. It also investigates the real-time performance by implementing the proposed scheme with Python. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096593044

The development and application of medical robotics, medical robotic devices, automated technical systems in the field of health care are already quite successful and have great potential. Such large-scale technological changes inevitably actualize the social roles of law, that should properly settle, protect and guide the development of nascent social relations, which until recently occurred everywhere in a kind of regulatory vacuum. Material and methods. The methodological basis of the study included general scientific methods (dialectical, logical, systemic, historical, sociological, statistical) and private scientific methods of legal science (formal-legal, historical-legal and comparative-legal). The empirical basis of the study was Russian and foreign regulatory legal acts and law enforcement practice, as well as legal doctrine. Results. Based on the comparative legal study a legal definition of the medical robots and various options for their classification, among them a special one, including surgical robots, robots used in restorative medicine, rehabilitation of immobilized patients, nursing and care robots, have been developed. Cyborgs are biological organisms containing mechanical or electronic components are allocated to a special group. Legal mechanisms for ensuring security and cybersecurity in this area are highlighted. The necessity of more flexible legal regulation of personal data concerning the health of citizens and medical confidentiality under new technological conditions is justified. Discussion. Legal regulation of the medical robots should be of a staged nature. General norms of sectoral significance can be formulated at later stages. At the moment, it is more rational to direct efforts to determine the legal regime of certain types of created artificial intelligence systems in the healthcare sector. Conclusion. The legal concept of robotics in healthcare should take a significant place in a wide range of scientific studies of the development of new technologies for the benefit, not to the detriment, of a person. © ЦОМАРТОВА Ф.В., 2020",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091322100

It brings adverse impacts on the liveable condition and economic growth of a country if this problem remains unsolved. Smart city is a potential solution to address the challenges of urbanisation by leveraging the technological breakthrough such as internet of things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data, and cloud computing to facilitate scarce resources planning and management. With numerous connected devices and vast communication networks, it poses a challenges of security threat which cannot be addressed by the conventional cybersecurity solutions. Blockchain offers a solution in securing the huge numbers of connected devices in smart city network. The application of blockchain technology is leading in the banking and financial industry. However, the uses and implementations in smart city have emerged in recent years. The combination of blockchain technology and smart city has offered a great potential for sustainable development. Thus, it is imperative to discuss the potential of these two elements in making the city safer and sustainable. This paper explores how the blockchain technology application can help in managing smart city and achieve sustainability. The findings revealed that there are five key areas of blockchain application in smart city which are smart governance, smart mobility, smart asset, smart utility and smart logistic. A framework for smart sustainable city with blockchain technology is presented as an outcome of this study. It gives a clear overview for the policy makers and regulators of how blockchain supports within smart city framework.

This paper investigates the factors that affect the frequency of cybercrime originating within a country. These factors were grouped into three categories, namely, economic capital, technological capital, and cybersecurity preparedness. On analyzing the data from 124 countries, it emerges that the economic capital and technological capital of a country are the primary factors that influence the frequency of cybercrime originating within it. Technological capital also partially mediates the relationship between economic capital and the frequency of cybercrime originating within the nation. Furthermore, the cybersecurity preparedness of a nation negatively moderates the relationship between technological capital and frequency of cybercrime originating within it. The findings have significant implications for policymakers at the national level and managers at the organizational level concerning cybersecurity preparedness. They should focus on both hard (legal, technical, organizational) and soft (training and co-operational) aspects of cybersecurity preparation to minimize the incidence of cybercrime within a nation. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Associated benefits such as flexibility, payment on an on-demand basis and the lack of no need for IT staff are among the reasons for its adoption. However, these services represent not only benefits to users but also threats, with cybersecurity issues being the biggest roadblock to cloud computing success. Although ensuring data security on the cloud has been the responsibility of providers, these threats seem to be unavoidable. In such circumstances, both providers and users have to coordinate efforts to minimize negative consequences that might occur from these events. The purpose of this paper is to assess how providers and users can rely on social media to communicate risky events. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the Situational Theory of Publics and trust, the authors developed three research questions to analyze stakeholders’ communication patterns after a security breach. By gathering Twitter data, the authors analyzed the data security breach faced by the Premera Blue Cross’ Web application. Findings: The results indicate that Premera acted as the main source of information for Twitter users, while trustworthy actors such as IT security firms, specialists and local news media acted as intermediaries, creating small communities around them. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. Originality/value: Social media could be used for diffusing information of potential threats; no research has assessed its usage in a cloud-based security breach context. The study aims to fill this gap and propose a framework to engage cloud users in co-securing their data along with cloud providers when they face similar situations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077554446

Quantum cryptography, conversely, promises an unprecedented level of security, yet this benefit comes with some danger: revisionist actors with impenetrable communications might be able to conduct surprise attacks and covert conspiracies. In reality, neither of these threat scenarios are likely. Intelligence advantage in political competition depends on the interaction of technological infrastructure with organizational institutions. Robust cryptosystems can be undermined by poor organizational coordination, and careful security policy can compensate for technical vulnerabilities. Scientific innovation in quantum technology only affects one of these dimensions while potentially complicating the other. Even if the formidable engineering challenges of quantum computing can be overcome, signals intelligence collectors will still have to analyze a vast number of decrypts and deliver timely and relevant judgments to interested decision makers. The quantum networks of tomorrow, similarly, will provide little protection for complex organizations that have weak operations security practices.

This has been a call for attention to rethinking innovative methods to improve supply chain resilience. Emerging manufacturing technologies like additive/hybrid manufacturing are enabling small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to transform into cybermanufacturing kiosks that deliver manufacturing-as-a-service by digitizing much of the manufacturing workflow (design, communication, and manufacturing). This transformation is causing a paradigm shift in which major producers and original equipment manufacturers can outsource manufacturing of components to distributed SMEs located near the point of need. The increasing reliance on a digital thread would reduce the burden of resiliency required from the physical supply chains. Although digital threads are reducing the burden on the physical supply chains, they introduce a new class of cyber-resilience requirements, chiefly in ensuring the integrity of the designs and other intellectual properties shared across the digital thread. A novel design-sharing scheme for the digital thread based on video streaming is introduced herein to address the issue of IP theft and tampering. The potential of design-sharing schemes for the improvement of the cyberresilience of digital supply chains is discussed.

A domain ontology was developed using a two-step approach: (1) the symmetry stage and (2) the machine adjustment. The first stage is based on the symmetry between the way humans represent a domain and the way machine learning solutions do. Therefore, the cybersecurity field was initially modeled based on the expertise of cybersecurity professionals. A dictionary of relevant entities was created; the entities were classified into 29 categories and later implemented as classes in a natural language processing model based on machine learning. After running successive performance tests, the ontology was remodeled from 29 to 18 classes. Using the ontology, a natural language processing model based on a supervised learning model was defined. We trained the model using sets of approximately 300,000 words. Remarkably, our model obtained an F1 score of 0.81 for named entity recognition and 0.58 for relation extraction, showing superior results compared to other similar models identified in the literature. Furthermore, in order to be easily used and tested, a web application that integrates our model as the core component was developed. © 2020 by the author.

Like any disruptive technology, its growing popularity inevitably attracts cyber security actors, for whom the health sector is attractive because it combines mission- critical infrastructure and high-value data with cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In this Perspective, we explore cyber security aspects of microbial NGS. We discuss the motivations and objectives for such attack, its feasibility and implications, and highlight policy considerations aimed at threat mitigation. Particular focus is placed on the attack vectors, where the entire process of NGS, from sample to result, could be vulnerable, and a risk assessment based on probability and impact for representative attack vectors is presented. Cyber attacks on microbial NGS could result in loss of confidentiality (leakage of personal or institutional data), integrity (misdetection of pathogens) and availability (denial of sequencing services). NGS platforms are also at risk of being used as propagation vectors, compromising an entire system or network. Owing to the rapid evolution of microbial NGS and its applications, and in light of the dynamics of the cyber security domain, frequent risk assessments should be carried out in order to identify new threats and underpin constantly updated public health policies. © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

However, in this authentication method, various attack techniques have emerged to steal passwords input from the keyboard, hence, the keyboard data does not ensure security. To detect and prevent such an attack, a keyboard data protection technique using random keyboard data generation has been presented. This technique protects keyboard data by generating dummy keyboard data while the attacker obtains the keyboard data. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of keyboard data exposure under the keyboard data protection technique. To prove the proposed attack technique, we gathered all the dummy keyboard data generated by the defense tool, and the real keyboard data input by the user, and evaluated the cybersecurity threat of keyboard data based on the machine learning-based offensive technique. We verified that an adversary obtains the keyboard data with 96.2% accuracy even if the attack technique that makes it impossible to attack keyboard data exposure is used. Namely, the proposed method in this study obviously differentiates the keyboard data input by the user from dummy keyboard data. Therefore, the contributions of this paper are that we derived and verified a new security threat and a new vulnerability of password authentication.

While the experiments illuminated growing biosecurity concerns regarding gain-of-function research, the controversy also signaled an evolving biosecurity threat landscape in which biological information, understood to be a latent and potential form of biological life, and the digital infrastructures that circulate this information, have also come to be seen as dangerous. This new threat landscape is informed by the technological framing of biological life as code. What kinds of biosecurity practices are called for when biological life is understood as code and what are the implications for life itself of developing such security practices? The United States has developed a techno-security infrastructure, which this article calls ‘bioveillance,’ in response to the dangers of mobile and mutable biological information. Collapsing biosecurity and cybersecurity into the emerging field of cyberbiosecurity and mirroring the networked life forms that it intends to prevent from proliferating, bioveillance is a vital component in a burgeoning global techno-security culture. The fact that biological life is not a code or information in any strict sense means that bioveillance will face significant challenges in its implementation not least because by using digital technologies to manage the communicability of informationalised biology, bioveillance also produces and proliferates that which it aims to forestall. This means that the more U.S. institutions do to generate biological information for biosecurity purposes, the more bioinsecurities they risk producing.

However, the results show that there are differences not only between the nodal clusters but also inside them regarding their positioning within the network. We argue that instead of a type of nodal cluster, division based on the roles and individual needs could be more relevant. Recognition of roles could encourage netizens to co-produce cybersecurity from their respective premises. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053864470

Assuming most people have the intention of complying with safe practices, it is still no surprise that people violate policies and put sensitive data at risk regularly. Previous research has investigated all of the “Big Five” personality factors in relation to cybersecurity behavior, although there is no consensus regarding which factors are most important. In this study, data were collected from 676 undergraduate students who were administered the Employees’ Online Security Behavior and Beliefs questionnaire and the Big Five Inventory–44. Significant correlations were observed between self-reported cybersecurity behaviors and some, but not all, personality constructs. Linear regression was used to examine whether the 5 personality factors were significantly associated with cybersecurity behaviors, and a hierarchical regression examined the personality factors that explained additional variance over-and-above cybersecurity behaviors, specifically perceived barriers, response efficacy, and security self-efficacy. Conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness were significantly associated with self-reported cybersecurity behaviors. Results suggest that personality plays an important role in understanding cybersecurity behaviors, which is consistent with a growing body of literature highlighting conscientiousness as a strong predictor of cybersecurity behaviors. The present study’s findings suggest that personality structure is associated with cybersecurity behaviors and that conscientiousness and openness may be particularly salient to this relationship.

A distribution management system (DMS) enables real-time monitoring and dynamic controls of the power distribution networks. As such, their controls should be designed to be resilient against distribution grid disturbances and cyber events. Due to the high penetration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the DMS, the reliability of power distribution grids is highly dependent on the cyber system. However, most power distribution applications, communication protocols, and devices are vulnerable to the cyber attacks since they are designed and implemented before cybersecurity became a critical issue. Recent reports and cyber attack incidents clearly indicate that cyber-attacks are increasingly likely on the power system infrastructures, e.g., control centers, nuclear power plants, and substations. These attacks may cause significant damages to the power grid. Cybersecurity research for the power distribution grid is a high priority subject in the emerging smart grid environment. This article proposes cybersecurity enhanced distribution automation system (DAS) with a multi-agent system (MAS). The proposed multiagent based cyber attack detection and mitigation algorithms can identify the anomalies, abnormal activities, and unusual system operations of the DAS. The proposed algorithms have been applied to the existing communication protocols, protection schemes, and restoration applications. The result is validated with a testbed and proposes a new integrated tool for the detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a power distribution grid with multiple feeders. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Cybercriminals are developing new ways to avoid attack detection, so existing approaches are not able to withstand the growing threat of attacks. Meanwhile, the consequences of cyberattacks are becoming more dangerous and destructive. One of the approaches to solve the problem is the construction of resilient systems that are able to quickly recover and continue to function under attack conditions. The subject of research is the construction process of the resilient computer systems in the face of cyber threats. The goal is to develop a taxonomy and ontology of resilient computer systems under cyberthreats. Results. The article presents the definitions of the resilience from the point of view of cybersecurity, presents the gap between the concepts of resilience and dependability. The paper presents the main elements of the taxonomic scheme of computer system resilience, which include threats (changes in the environment and requirements, network attacks, attacks on software, software and hardware vulnerabilities, errors, failures), information and technical conditions that computer system passes during its operating cycle, the principles on which resilience is based (proactivity, adaptability, resistance, diversity, elasticity, controlled degradation, defense in depth, ability to evolvability), as well as primary and secondary properties. Based on the above elements, a generalized taxonomic scheme of resilience related to information security has been developed. The work presents the operational cycle of a resilient CS as a set of information and technical states that the system goes through (preparation, system protection, threat detection, threat absorption, response to a threat, system recovery after a cyberattack, adaptation.) An ontology scheme of the resilience from the point of view of information security of computer systems in the presence of cyberthreats is developed.

Mass scanning of the Internet has opened a broad range of possibilities for security tools that help cybersecurity centers detect weaknesses and vulnerabilities in cyberspace. However, one critical issue faced by national cybersecurity centers is the collection of information about IP addresses and subnet ranges. To develop a data collection mechanism for such information and maintain this information with continuous updates, a scanning system is needed. Therefore, this research creates a novel mass scanning framework that collects the information needed for any security investigation of cyberspace as well as preserving the obtained information for any future research analysis by the Saudi National Cybersecurity Center (NCSC), now part of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA). In the proposed framework, multiple instances of the scan are distributed across hosts acting as virtual scan engines, and network ranges are split among the hosts to schedule daily or weekly scanning for a wide range of IP addresses among a possible 65,535 ports per IP. In comparison with other benchmarking tools such as Nmap scanner, our proposed framework leads to faster scanning of cyberspace and greatly reduces scanning time to 30% of Nmap’s scanning time. © 2020, Tech Science Press.

Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that can play an important role in providing data transparency, trust, immutability, integrity, and traceability to all food supply chain members. The purpose of this review is to depict a landscape of the scientific literature enriched by an author's keywords analysis to develop and test blockchain’s capabilities for cyber-risks prevention in international food supply chains. This paper combines a systematic literature review (SLR) process with the analysis of bibliographic networks. Papers from interdisciplinary areas published between 2016 and 2020 were selected to review the evolution of cyber-risks, cybersecurity solutions, and blockchain solutions used as a reference to identify, classify and specify requirements for a cyber secure distributed ledger. The findings show how blockchain technology needs other technologies, such as advanced ICT and Internet of Things (IoTs), for better food product traceability, safety, and transparency. It shows the multiple choices of blockchain architectures and their maturity level to interface with ICTs and IoTs. Based on the analysis of literature, research gaps, and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding the applications of blockchain technology for managing cyber risks in the food supply chain.

The digital economy creates new impetuses for economic growth, but at the same time it deepens global inequality and impacts the growth of countries of the global South. The role of global governance institutions such as the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – the main representative of developing countries in global governance – in the promotion of digital growth has not yet been fully explored. There is also some ambiguity concerning the development level of the digital economy in particular countries. In the context of Russia’s third BRICS presidency in 2020, issues of digital development in BRICS have become particularly relevant. The author analyzes current indicators of digital development in the BRICS countries, drawing on several existing methodologies, ratings, and decisions made by BRICS on issues of digital growth and levels of compliance, and makes recommendations for the further development of BRICS’ digital agenda. According to data provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the European Union (EU) and the International Development Institute (IDI), the BRICS countries differ in terms of the maturity of their digital economies. They are characterized by a relatively low quality and affordability of digital infrastructure; additionally, the penetration of information and communications technology (ICT) into business and daily activities in BRICS countries lags behind the world leaders, and data on the quality and efficiency of regulatory and innovative frameworks in the BRICS countries is insufficient. However, decisions made by BRICS on matters of digital growth are followed with a high-average level of compliance. Thus, recommendations for the further development of BRICS’ digital agenda are strategic in nature. The author defines three promising areas of cooperation on digital matters during Russia’s 2020 BRICS presidency: facilitation of dialog and exchange of best practices supporting digital growth; development of a common BRICS standard offor the production of digital goods and services and; promotion of a common BRICS position on cybersecurity issues. © 2020, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS RESEARCH JOURNAL.

Consequently, web applications have increasingly become the target of cyberattacks. Notably, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on web applications are increasing and have become the critical focus of information security experts' reports. Machine learning (ML) technique has significantly advanced and shown impressive results in the area of cybersecurity. However, XSS training datasets are often limited and significantly unbalanced, which does not meet well-developed ML algorithms' requirements and potentially limits the detection system efficiency. Furthermore, XSS attacks have multiple payload vectors that execute in different ways, resulting in many real threats passing through the detection system undetected. In this study, we propose a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a gradient penalty to enhance the XSS detection system in a low-resource data environment. The proposed method integrates a conditional generative adversarial network and Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a gradient penalty to obtain necessary data from directivity, which improves the strength of the security system over unbalance data. The proposed method generates synthetic samples of minority class that have identical distribution as real XSS attack scenarios. The augmented data were used to train a new boosting model and subsequently evaluated the model using a real test dataset. Experiments on two unbalanced XSS attack datasets demonstrate that the proposed model generates valid and reliable samples.

By invoking a historical perspective, policy developments that have shaped the cybersecurity landscape of the EU are highlighted. More concretely, this contribution investigates how the EU has been delimiting and constructing its cybersecurity policies in relation to different and sometimes opposing objectives, and questions what such choices reveal about (and how they determine) the evolution of the EU’s cybersecurity policy and its legal contours. For this purpose, the major steps in the evolution of the EU’s agenda on cybersecurity are analysed, ranging from the adoption of the 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy to other numerous norms, initiatives and sectorial frameworks that tackle issues arising from the active use of information systems and networks. The chapter reviews the mobilisation of multiple areas (such as the regulation of electronic communications, critical infrastructures and cybercrime) in the name of cybersecurity imperatives, and explores how the operationalisation of such imperatives surfaced in the EU cybersecurity strategy published in September 2017. The chapter suggests that one of the key challenges of cybersecurity regulation is to impose the right obligations on the right actors, through the right instrument. Reflecting on issues surrounding the current liability framework dating from the 80s, it considers how principles such as data protection by design and default as well as the ‘duty of care’ have emerged. Finally, the chapter considers how the perception of cybersecurity’s relationship with (national) security plays a determinant role in the current EU legislative and policy debates, where fundamental rights considerations, despite being acknowledged in numerous policy documents, are only considered in a limited manner. © 2020, The Author(s).",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098051492

It is necessary that the control of these IT eco-systems is established. The regulation is very important in case of protected / controlled areas both in terms of technology and human behavior. Regulation forms are trying to keep up with this challenge. It is clear that there are existing uniform methodologies (e.g. COBIT, ITIL) and globally established procedures as well (e.g. ISO27000 and NIST800). In the course of the research of controlled areas, it is necessary to investigate the currently available standards from the aspect of information security.

Methods: Employing a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm that combines traditional rule-based morphological manipulations with modern statistical machine learning, we deployed a next generation software, ALICE (Automated Liquid Biopsy Cell Enumerator) to identify and enumerate minute amounts of tumor cell phenotypes bestrewed in massive populations of leukocytes. As a code designed for futurity, ALICE is armed with internet of things (IOT) connectivity to promote pedagogy and continuing education and also, an advanced cybersecurity system to safeguard against digital attacks from malicious data tampering. Results: By combining robust principal component analysis, random forest classifier and cubic support vector machine, ALICE was able to detect synthetic, anomalous and tampered input images with an average recall and precision of 0.840 and 0.752, respectively. In terms of phenotyping enumeration, ALICE was able to enumerate various circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotypes with a reliability ranging from 0.725 (substantial agreement) to 0.961 (almost perfect) as compared to human analysts. Further, two subpopulations of circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) were serendipitously discovered and labeled as CHC-1 (DAPI+/CD45+/E-cadherin+/vimentin-) and CHC-2 (DAPI+ /CD45+/E-cadherin+/vimentin+) in the peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer patients. CHC-1 was found to correlate with nodal staging and was able to classify lymph node metastasis with a sensitivity of 0.615 (95% CI: 0.374-0.898) and specificity of 1.000 (95% CI: 1.000-1.000). Conclusion: This study presented a machine-learning-augmented rule-based hybrid AI algorithm with enhanced cybersecurity and connectivity for the automatic and flexibly-adapting enumeration of cellular liquid biopsies.

Thus, to reduce medical device security threats, important devices must be identified and prioritized. In this study, we propose a multicriteria decision-making model that prioritizes medical devices by extending the Fennigkoh and Smith model to include security threats. First, we formulate criteria for evaluating medical device functions based on the classification of the medical devices according to their unique functions, connections, and data types. Then, through threat modeling, we develop a method of identifying and evaluating security threats to these devices. We discuss establishing a safer MEMP by analyzing the attack occurrence probability (AOP) and attack success probability (ASP) of medical devices and the inherent security threats that these devices face, none of which are considered in the existing model.

Among these challenges are malicious activities that target IoT devices and cause serious damage, such as data leakage, phishing and spamming campaigns, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and security breaches. In this paper, a stacked deep learning method is proposed to detect malicious traffic data, particularly malicious attacks targeting IoT devices. The proposed stacked deep learning method is bundled with five pretrained residual networks (ResNets) to deeply learn the characteristics of the suspicious activities and distinguish them from normal traffic. Each pretrained ResNet model consists of 10 residual blocks. We used two large datasets to evaluate the performance of our detection method. We investigated two heterogeneous IoT environments to make our approach deployable in any IoT setting. Our proposed method has the ability to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic data and detect most IoT attacks. The experimental results show that our proposed stacked deep learning method can provide a higher detection rate in real time compared with existing classification techniques. © 2020 Bandar Alotaibi and Munif Alotaibi.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092175763

We explore an alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC, implements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to adopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and recommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end-user SMBs and encourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT in CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer insight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective automated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB’s hands-on skills, tools adaptedness, and the users’ willingness to documenting confidential information. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing them to understand what they do. An SMB’s motivation to improve security depended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the SMB’s business model and IT infrastructure.

Within vulnerability management, there are multiple points where knowing whether an exploit targeting a given vulnerability is publicly available would inform vulnerability mitigation priority. Despite the value of this question, there is no available historical baseline of when and how many vulnerabilities get associated public exploits. We analyze all vulnerabilities with CVE-IDs since two common repositories of public exploit data became available and find that 4.1%±0.1% of CVE-IDs have public exploit code associated with them within 365 days. We analyze eight features of a CVE-ID for how they influence exploit publication. Some categories of vulnerability (CWE) are much more likely to have exploit code published than others. Vendor is a sporadic predictor of exploit publication likelihood. More vendors involved in a CVE-ID does not appear to affect exploit publication. CVSS score, commonness of the CWE, and how recently the CVE-ID was published all slightly increase the exploit publication likelihood; the confidence intervals for the size of these three effects overlap.

To support this, both researchers and practitioners need to be familiar with current methods of ensuring cybersecurity (CyberSec). In particular, the use of artificial intelligence for combating cybercrimes. However, there is lack of summaries on artificial intelligent methods for combating cybercrimes. To address this knowledge gap, this study sampled 131 articles from two main scholarly databases (ACM digital library and IEEE Xplore). Using a systematic mapping, the articles were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. It was observed that artificial intelligent methods have made remarkable contributions to combating cybercrimes with significant improvement in intrusion detection systems. It was also observed that there is a reduction in computational complexity, model training times and false alarms. However, there is a significant skewness within the domain. Most studies have focused on intrusion detection and prevention systems, and the most dominant technique used was support vector machines. The findings also revealed that majority of the studies were published in two journal outlets. It is therefore suggested that to enhance research in artificial intelligence for CyberSec, researchers need to adopt newer techniques and also publish in other related outlets. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090296595

CPES indeed revolutionize the power grid efficiency and operational performance, but it also gives rise to new security challenges, causing catastrophic consequences in power system. Therefore, this article proposes a new false data injection attack (FDIA) detection mechanism to automatically recognize the intrusions and thereby improve the cybersecurity of CPES. In this mechanism, a two-stage FDIA model is developed to generate training dataset for the machine learning-based detector, and an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier is meticulously designed by combining with active learning and Bayesian optimization techniques to improve training efficiency and model performance respectively. The proposed FDIA defense strategy can properly extract the nonstationary and nonlinear attacking features and thus locate the biased states with a high accuracy. The obtained numerical results on the standard IEEE 14-, 57- and 118-bus systems highlight the destructive effects of the developed two-stage FDIA and comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDIA detection mechanism. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090287644

Smart systems are implemented and deployed to provide intelligent features that help improve efficiency and quality of life. This creates a huge repository of data representing many aspects of smart city operations. Many data-driven applications can take advantage of this data to further improve the 'smartness' of a smart city. At the same time, smart city systems, being very large-scale distributed systems and highly integrated with the physical infrastructure and residents of the city, pose immense security challenges as well. So why don't we take advantage of this data to improve security measures? In this paper we propose the use of data-driven security approaches to secure smart city systems. To illustrate the significance of this approach we first identify the different challenges for securing smart city systems given the unique characteristics of these systems. Then we discuss the benefits of using data-driven security. Furthermore, we categorize the different types of security applications (features) needed to help capitalize on the data needs and benefits. We also discuss the how these categories of applications can alleviate some of the challenges. In addition, we highlight possible future research directions to incorporate effective data-driven security in smart city systems. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090265200

Meanwhile, a vehicle should guarantee a safe and comfortable trip for users. Therefore, how to design a cybersecurity-critical system in vehicles with safety and user experience (UX) considerations is increasingly essential. However, most co-design methods focus on safety engineering with attack concerns and do not discuss conflicts and integration, and few contain the UX aspect. Besides, most existing approaches are abstract at a high level without practical guidelines. This paper presents a literature review of existing safety and security design approaches and proposes a systematic approach for cybersecurity design of in-vehicle network systems based on the guideline in SAE J3061. The trade-off analysis is performed by using association keys and the proposed affecting map. The design process of an example Diagnostic on Internet Protocol (DoIP) system is reported to show how the approach works. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed one considers safety, cybersecurity, and UX simultaneously, solves conflicts qualitatively or quantitatively, and obtains trade-off design requirements. This approach is applicable to the cybersecurity-driven design of in-vehicle network systems in the early stage with safety and UX considerations. © 2020 Jinghua Yu and Feng Luo.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089985982

Due to the difficulty of discovering such breaches, an adaptive, accurate, and proactive database security strategy is required. Intrusion detection systems are utilized to detect, as fast as possible, user's account privilege misuse when a prevention mechanism has failed to address such breaches. In order to address the foremost deficiencies of intrusion detection systems, artificial immune systems are used to tackle these defects. The dynamic and more complex nature of cybersecurity, as well as the high false positive rate and high false negative percentage in current intrusion detection systems, are examples of such deficiency. In this paper, we propose an adaptable efficient database intrusion detection algorithm based on a combination of the Danger Theory model and the Negative Selection algorithm from artificial immune system mechanisms. Experimental results for the implementation of the proposed algorithm provide a self-learning mechanism for achieving high detection coverage with a low false positive rate by using the signature of previously detected intrusions as detectors for the future detection process. The proposed algorithm can enhance detecting insider threats and eliminate data breaches by protecting confidentiality, ensuring integrity, and maintaining availability. To give an integrated picture, a comprehensive and informative survey for the different research directions that are related to the proposed algorithm is performed. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089938270

Given the importance of the oil and gas sector on the global economy and the diversity of critical systems often being controlled over remote locations, it is highly important to understand and mitigate such attacks. In this paper, we survey cyber-attacks on all three domains of the oil and gas sector (upstream, midstream, downstream) starting from the early 90s up until 2020. For each domain, we document and analyze verified attacks based on real-world reports and published demo attacks on systems. We map and catalogue the attack types used in each case, in order to understand common and subliminal attack paths against oil and gas critical operations. Our aim is threefold, i.e., first, to assess documented attacks using standardized impact assessment techniques and highlight potential consequences of cyber-attacks on this sector, second, to build a vulnerability taxonomy based on technical knowledge gathered by all such incidents and connect each vulnerability with oil and gas systems and respective attack paths, and third, to map the documented knowledge and taxonomies with MITRE's international knowledge base of Adversary Tactics and Techniques, so as to provide a general guide for analyzing and protecting against cyber-attacks at oil and gas infrastructures. © 2013 IEEE.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089224403

Anomaly detection has, in fact, been extensively studied in categorical sequences. However, we often have access to time series data that represent paths through networks. Examples include transaction sequences in financial networks, click streams of users in networks of cross-referenced documents, or travel itineraries in transportation networks. To reliably detect anomalies, we must account for the fact that such data contain a large number of independent observations of paths constrained by a graph topology. Moreover, the heterogeneity of real systems rules out frequency-based anomaly detection techniques, which do not account for highly skewed edge and degree statistics. To address this problem, we introduce HYPA, a novel framework for the unsupervised detection of anomalies in large corpora of variable-length temporal paths in a graph. HYPA provides an efficient analytical method to detect paths with anomalous frequencies that result from nodes being traversed in unexpected chronological order.

Energy sector is going under massive transformation as a result of smart grid design and development. It is characterized by full duplex communication of information along with bidirectional flow of electricity. Smart grid is an amalgamation of power and communication infrastructures. It is a complex hierarchical architecture with heterogeneous communication networks. Smart grid is an automated network with self-healing capability. A central controller manages an entire operation. A robust and secured infrastructure is inevitable for enormous amount of data communication. Cybersecurity is an indispensable constituent of smart grid technology. Limited spectrum availability, communication delays, interoperability between various protocols and network scalability are major challenges for the deployment of secured infrastructure. Smart grid is being transformed from idea to actual execution and deployment. There are several issues and challenges to be deciphered during design, development and deployment process. Cybersecurity is one of the key challenges for secured and reliable operation of smart grid technology. Cyber security can be defined as protection from exactions transported by computer network and/or terminals and the safety of assets from intentional or unintentional alterations or damage from malicious use of software-based control services. Smart grid communication infrastructure integrates WSN, communication transceivers, AMI, SCADA, electronics devices with firmware and various network devices used for hierarchical communication network layers. All these components are crucial and inevitable for smart grid communication infrastructure. These components are susceptible to cyberattacks. NIST has provided strategy for standardization of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a ubiquitous notion as smart grid is an always ON network comprising of IoT. This paper is anticipated to serve as a survey and study of various cybersecurity concerns pertaining to smart grid and possible elucidations. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085326714

These threats have been known for years, but it is very difficult to handle them effectively, because they are strictly related to human nature. Social engineering is not just a phishing email; indeed, it is possible to distinguish several forms of attack which combine different elements, from human to social to physical and technological. According to a psychological point of view, social engineering is a powerful means of gaining information exploiting individuals’ weaknesses. Moreover, due to the mechanisms of persuasion, widely studied in literature, it is easy to imagine how complicated the management of this threat is. Appropriate training of employees, especially of key roles of the company, can be an effective antidote to social engineering. Given the current scenario and the future perspective in cybersecurity, it is clear that the approach used to manage cybersecurity requires a radical change. Currently, the preferred cybersecurity strategy is still based on technological solutions, without brilliant results, since cyberthreats keep growing. Many are convinced that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be an opportunity for managing cybersecurity; whether true or not, it is however evident that AI has also the power to generate new threats and to strengthen the existing ones. Therefore, we should be very prudent when technologies are presented as a miracle solution for cybersecurity problems. The starting point is that technology has to be deployed under full human control. Then, critical thinking is needed to develop alternatives to improve the current approach to cybersecurity. In short, we need to develop a multidisciplinary vision of cybersecurity, involving other disciplines and assuming different perspectives. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085159501

The unsupervised identification and characterization of malware samples has been primarily treated as an early integration, multi-modal clustering problem where all possible features derived from the samples are concatenated into one feature vector, which can then be fed into a standard unsupervised learning algorithm. In this work, we focus on characterizing malware samples into possible threat actors from both late integration and intermediate integration multi-modal data perspectives. In doing so, we propose a new algorithm, Cross-Modal Influence Clustering, for characterizing malware samples into threat actor groups. We test our proposed method along with several other multi-modal clustering techniques on heterogeneous malware samples from three different threat actors.

Support vector machines (SVMs) are considered as efficient supervised learning approaches for classification due to their robustness against several types of model misspecifications and outliers. Kernel-based SVMs are known to be more flexible tools for a wide range of supervised learning tasks and can efficiently handle non-linear relationship between input variables and outputs (or labels). They are more robust with respect to the aforementioned model misspecifications, and also more accurate in the sense that the root-mean-square error computed by fitting the kernel-based SVMs is considerably smaller than the one computed by fitting the standard/linear SVMs. However, the choice of kernel type and particularity kernelâ€™s parameters could have significant impact on the classification accuracy and other supervised learning tasks required in network security, Internet of things, cybersecurity, etc. One of the findings of this study is that larger kernel parameter(s) would encourage SVMs with more localities and vice versa. This chapter provides some results on the effect of the kernel parameter on the kernel-based SVM classification. We thus first examine the effect of these parameters on the classification results using the kernel-based SVM, and then specify the optimal value of these parameters using cross-validation (CV) technique.

However, the presence of cybersecurity threat and privacy issues have become rampant nowadays, considering the magnitude of digital-related transactions, particularly on internet banking systems. The harmful impact perceived from the said threats negatively affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information to financial institutions (bank) and its customers. Again, the perception formed out of this displeasure (cybersecurity threat) interferes with bank customer's decision process regarding the e-banking adoption (or engagement) and retention. In view of this, the present article seeks to; (1) review empirical constructs (cybersecurity threats) in the previous work regarding customer's perception of cybersecurity threats that impedes e-banking adoption and retention and (2) propose a conceptual framework depicting the direct and indirect relationship among the constructs studied. Since the present study is entirely based on a conceptual study, we deployed both document and content analysis as a composite technique for executing the general aim of the study. Findings show that knowledge of perceived identity theft, perceived impersonation, and perceived account hijacked are regarded as cybersecurity threats from the customer's viewpoint that impedes their e-banking adoption and retention. The review discovered that victims (bank customers) of such perceived threats are apparently skeptical in their quest to engage in e-banking adoption and retention. Similarly, the cybersecurity threat-related information, however, poses a danger to users and a sense of unwillingness to engage or retain in e-banking transaction space. Practically, the survival of every business largely depends on its customer base (retention), hence this study propels the financial institutions as a reminder to strategically strengthen their security and privacy concern inasmuch as cybercrime in the banking sector is concerned. In theory, the paper adds up to the concept of cybersecurity repercussion especially in the scope of internet banking.

We demonstrate how technical event logging can be linked to learning outcomes and skills measurement by defining intermediate abstraction layers. These take raw forensic data from the game-system and network, and gradually group them into events and abstract measurements until they can be mapped to learning theories. The suggested approach enables deeper insights into learning. This approach has been applied for developing labs using our cloud-based open-source tool. The labs have been used by more than 2 000 learners in over 15 000 sessions. A thorough hands-on skills assessment was conducted before and after a set of exercises for 27 participants.

The crux of this increasing dependence on the internet is the rise of different kinds of cyberattacks on unsuspecting users. One such attack is phishing, which aims at stealing user information via deceptive websites. The primary defense against phishing consists of maintaining a black list of the phishing URLs. However, a black list approach is reactive and cannot defend against new phishing websites. For this reason, a number of research have been done on using machine learning techniques to detect previously unseen phishing URLs. While they show promising results, any such implementation is yet to be seen. This is because 1) little work has been done on developing a complete end-to-end framework for phishing URL detection 2) it is prohibitively slow to detect phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms. In this work we address these two issues by formulating a robust framework for fast and automated detection of phishing URLs.

Currently, there is much research on the security schemes and methods of disseminating messages. Furthermore, there is a deficiency of information regarding resource optimization. This paper takes an interdisciplinary approach by merging both cybersecurity and data science to optimize and secure the network. The proposed method applies Prim's algorithm to an existing vehicular security scheme, Privacy-Preserving Dual Authentication Scheme (PPDAS), to further network efficiency in terms of time consumption. When a dual authentication security scheme is in place, the time taken for message dissemination follows a quadratic growth; applying Prim's algorithm to the security scheme reduces the time to disseminate messages to a linear growth. The number of messages sent was decreased by a magnitude of up to 44.57. Contemporary security schemes are compared with PPDAS to justify the overhead consumption. The usage of network resources, such as time, is reduced, which substantially enhances the performance of the vehicular network and allows for the scalability of the IoV. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083075537

However, the related recommendations are typically the same for all organizations and their employees, regardless of the nature and the level of risk for different groups of users. Building upon an existing cybersecurity investment model, this paper presents a tool for optimal selection of cyber hygiene safeguards, which we refer as the Optimal Safeguards Tool (OST). The model combines game theory and combinatorial optimization (0-1 Knapsack) taking into account the probability of each user group to being attacked, the value of assets accessible by each group, and the efficacy of each control for a particular group. The model considers indirect cost as the time employees could require for learning and trainning against an implemented control. Utilizing a game-theoretic framework to support the Knapsack optimization problem permits us to optimally select safeguards’ application levels minimizing the aggregated expected damage within a security investment budget. We evaluate OST in a healthcare domain use case. In particular, on the Critical Internet Security (CIS) Control group 17 for implementing security awareness and training programs for employees belonging to the ICT, clinical and administration personnel of a hospital. We compare the strategies implemented by OST against alternative common-sense defending approaches for three different types of attackers: Nash, Weighted and Opportunistic. Our results show that Nash defending strategies are consistently better than the competing strategies for all attacker types with a minor exception where the Nash defending strategy, for a specific game, performs at least as good as other common-sense approaches. Finally, we illustrate the alternative investment strategies on different Nash equilibria (called plans) and discuss the optimal choice using the framework of 0-1 Knapsack optimization. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079589361

While there is recent interest in the dynamic properties of performance through resilience analysis, limited research addresses the dynamic nature of cyber-system vulnerability. This paper presents an iterative data-driven learning approach to evaluate and manage vulnerabilities for such complex systems. These time-varying system health characteristics may not be directly observable, but can be inferred using observable indicators. The approach recognizes that multiple types of vulnerabilities need to be included in a holistic system health assessment. The methods are applied to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) database containing thousands of documented cybersecurity vulnerabilities over nearly two decades.

Nevertheless, the cyberspace of these aerospace CPSes offers many opportunities for malicious actors who threaten the security and privacy of vehicles/aircraft and their applications. Unprotected or poorly protected systems can easily be exploited for malicious purposes. Indeed, aerospace CPSes are always under threat from an increasing number of cyber-attacks through sensory or wireless channels, hardware, software or actuators. Recently, due to the significant advances and impressive results of machine learning techniques in the fields of image recognition, natural language processing and speech recognition for various long-standing artificial intelligence tasks, there has been a great interest in applying them to intrusion detection in the field of cybersecurity. In this chapter, we present different machine learning techniques for IoT intrusion detection in aerospace cyber-physical systems. The application of machine learning for cybersecurity in IoT requires the availability of substantial data on IoT attacks, but the lack of data on IoT attacks is a significant problem. In our study, the Cooja IoT simulator was used to generate high fidelity attack data in IoT 6LoWPAN networks. The efficient network architecture for all machine models is chosen based on comparing the performance of various network topologies and network scenarios. The experimental results show that Machine learning models for intrusion detection give better results by more than 99% in terms of accuracy, efficiency and detection rate. Also, it requires a low energy consumption overhead and memory, which proves that the proposed models can be used in constrained environments such as IoT sensors. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068756877

This limits their suitability in detecting new attacks. Reinforcement learning is different from traditional machine learning algorithms used in the cybersecurity domain. Compared to traditional ML algorithms, reinforcement learning does not need a mapping of the input-output space or a specific user-defined metric to compare data points. This is important for the cybersecurity domain, especially for malware detection and mitigation, as not all problems have a single, known, correct answer. Often, security researchers have to resort to guided trial and error to understand the presence of a malware and mitigate it.In this paper, we incorporate prior knowledge, represented as Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKGs), to guide the exploration of an RL algorithm to detect malware. CKGs capture semantic relationships between cyber-entities, including that mined from open source. Instead of trying out random guesses and observing the change in the environment, we aim to take the help of verified knowledge about cyber-attack to guide our reinforcement learning algorithm to effectively identify ways to detect the presence of malicious filenames so that they can be deleted to mitigate a cyber-attack.

We evaluate the impact of adversarial attacks using NASA's turbofan engine dataset.

WBP provides both machine registration and authentication on a digital network through a low cost, non-invasive approach. The fingerprint is generated by a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique that accommodates small variations in physical signature data and can corroborate data provenance from machines by verifying machine identity through authentication. Additionally, this fingerprint hash simplifies asset management within a large enterprise or distributed network comprising of thousands of machines in a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm.

A large number of zero-day attacks are taking place on a continuous basis due to the inclusion of several protocols. Most of these attacks are minor variations of cyberattacks that have been carried out previously. This shows that problems are faced by even the most sophisticated methods, such as conventional machine learning systems, when identifying these minor variations in attacks over time. By considering a few challenges in the existing intrusion detection methods, an effective semisupervised technique is presented in this paper to decrease the false alarm rate and enhance the detection rate for intrusion detection systems (IDSs). The proposed approach proposes an IDS utilizing k-nearest neighbor hyperparameter tuning with fivefold cross-validation on semisupervised learning. For each unlabeled data point, its k-nearest neighbors in the training set are first identified. After that, based on statistical information gained from hyperparameter tuning of these neighboring data, namely the number of neighboring data points belonging to each possible class, distance metric, and distance weight, the new data are classified as normal or attack class. A widely used dataset NSL-KDD is employed to determine the robustness of the model. In comparison with IDS-based KNN algorithms, the simulation findings demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090065890

The debate involves governments and private parties, and can be approached through the different prisms of privacy, national security, and economics. This article provides historical background and context on the issue of government access to encryption, before focusing on the Dutch government's position on encryption. In January 2016 the Netherlands was the first country to adopt an official and unambiguous standpoint that ruled out backdoors in encryption. Building on interviews conducted with policymakers in various ministries, the authors elucidate the decision making process and identify key factors that led to the government's position. The impetus provided by Parliament, the role of the NGO Bits of Freedom, and an approach that transcended sectoral interests all contributed. While the unique political context and culture of the Netherlands complicates the application of lessons identified to other countries, the case study does illustrate how a multistakeholder process can lead to a clear standpoint of ruling out backdoors in encryption. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079455833

Introducing robot systems into surgical tasks provides additional enhancements, including improved precision, remote operation, and an intelligent software layer capable of filtering aberrant motion and scaling surgical maneuvers. However, the software interface in telesurgery also lends itself to potential adversarial cyber attacks. Such attacks can negatively effect both surgeon motion commands and sensory information relayed to the operator. To combat cyber attacks on the latter, one method to enhance surgeon feedback through multiple sensory pathways is to incorporate reliable, complementary forms of information across different sensory modes. Built-in partial redundancies or inferences between perceptual channels, or perception complementarities, can be used both to detect and recover from compromised operator feedback. In surgery, haptic sensations are extremely useful for surgeons to prevent undue and unwanted tissue damage from excessive tool-tissue force. Direct force sensing is not yet deployable due to sterilization requirements of the operating room. Instead, combinations of other sensing methods may be relied upon, such as noncontact model-based force estimation. This paper presents the design of a surgical simulator software that can be used for vision-based non-contact force sensing to inform the perception complementarity of vision and force feedback for telesurgery. A brief user study is conducted to verify the efficacy of graphical force feedback from vision-based force estimation, and suggests that vision may effectively complement direct force sensing. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099382943

One possible way to address this issue is through raising the awareness (through education) of software developers, with the intent to increase software quality and reduce the number of vulnerabilities. CyberSecurity Challenges (CSCs) are a novel serious game genre that aims to raise industrial software developers’ awareness of secure coding, secure coding guidelines, and secure coding best practices. An important industry-specific requirement to consider in designing these kinds of games is related to the whole event’s duration and how much time it takes to solve each challenge individually—the challenge solve time. In this work, we present two different methods to compute the challenge solve time: one method based on data collected from the CSC dashboard and another method based on a challenge heartbeat. The results obtained by both methods are presented; both methods are compared to each other, and the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a player profile, which is derived from dashboard data.

While dealing with the mathematical foundations of cybersecurity is only possible in specialized courses (tertiary level and beyond), it is essential to promote the role of mathematics in this field at early educational stages. With this in mind, we introduce Crypto Go, a physical card game that may be used both as a dissemination and as an educational tool. The game is carefully devised in order to entertain and stimulate players, while boosting their understanding on how basic cryptographic tools work and interplay. To get a preliminary assessment of our design, we collected data from a series of test workshops, which engaged over two hundred players from different ages and educational backgrounds. This basic evaluation indeed confirms that Crypto Go significantly improves students’ motivation and has a positive impact in their perception and understanding of the field. ©2020 by the authors.

This creates the requirement of analyzing the effect of the transmission system on the distribution system and vice versa with consideration of the additional complexity of the cyber infrastructure. Such an integrated testbed will also help with resiliency analysis, where resiliency refers to the ability of the system to continue serving energy to the critical loads even with limited extreme contingencies. Interaction of the physical power grid with the cyber layer can be effectively modeled using real-Time (RT) simulator for developing and validating various operational and control algorithms. Testbeds using RT simulators with multiple capabilities have been developed at different institutions. Still, no single existing testbed can offer full scalability while simultaneously meeting high fidelity requirements for resiliency experimentation. Co-simulating federated testbed assets can provide a scalable experimentation platform that can be leveraged for verification and validation. In this article, an architecture is developed for federated cyber-physical testbed. A local federation with two real-Time simulators is developed: real-Time digital simulator (RTDS) and OPAL-RT have been interfaced using VILLAS framework for end-To-end testing. Also, a real-Time linear predictor is developed and integrated here to address the communication latency impact on geographically allocated federated RT simulation. Finally, resiliency analysis tools are formulated and utilized for T\D systems. As an illustrative use case, the resiliency of a T\D test system is simulated, and the results are analyzed. A 179-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) transmission system is developed using OPAL-RT/ HYPERSIM, and a modified IEEE 13 node feeder system is modeled in RTDS/RSCAD and interfaced for resiliency analysis. © 1972-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095965397

Banks can improve their operational efficiency and quality of service by relying on CyberTech, but they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity. Thus, increasing investment in CyberTech becomes a strategic necessity for banks to combat cybersecurity hazards. The study investigates how disruptive digital transformation affects bank stability. In particular, it examines whether the law of diminishing marginal returns from overspending on CyberTech affects bank stability. Based on a global sample from 43 countries, we find that an increase in CyberTech spending above the threshold level adversely affects the stability of banks. The main reason behind the adverse effect of CyberTech spending on the stability of banks is that banks take more than the proportional risk for every dollar they spend on disruptive CyberTech after they cross a threshold level of spending. While results persist across sub-samples, our results indicate two important channels of technological regimes – a diminishing returns regime and an increasing returns regime. The diminishing returns regime improves bank stability through more aggressive spending on technology, and the increasing returns regime makes banks more unstable due to excess spending on disruptive CyberTech. The study has implications for cybersecurity and sustainable CyberTech spending for banks. © 2020",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093653421

Immediate disclosure (before a patch becomes available) could result in exploits with subsequent harm to installed systems. Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants of this timing. In this study, we investigate the impacts of (i) the perception of the vulnerability discoverer about the software producer, (ii) the type of vulnerable software, and (iii) the severity of the vulnerability, on a vulnerability discoverer's choice of disclosure timing. We collect data from three different sources and control for the vulnerability discoverer's motivations and beliefs. Our results indicate that those who perceive a software producer to be timely in its patch release, reward it by delaying the disclosure. We also find that it is more likely that the disclosure is delayed for open source software and it is less likely that the disclosure is delayed for more severe vulnerabilities. The findings of this study are relevant to software producers in their decision-making process on resource allocation for software patches and should also help policy-makers to devise regulations relevant to the timing of disclosures and patch releases. Furthermore, these findings could be relevant to software consumers searching for a particular software product that they would like to use.

Design/methodology/approach: A sample of data breach incidents is drawn from the Verizon VERIS Community Database (VCDB). Statistical comparisons between hospitality and non-hospitality industry firms are conducted following the Verizon A4 threat framework. Findings: The results reveal that breaches between hospitality and non-hospitality firms differ significantly in terms of actors, actions, assets and attributes. Specifically, proportions of breaches in the hospitality industry are larger in terms of external actors, hacking and malware, user devices compromised and integrity violations. Additionally, compared to other industries, point-of-sales (POS) system breaches occur at a higher rate in the hospitality industry. The study finds that company size, hacking and malware predict the likelihood of a POS breach. Research limitations/implications: The study uses secondary data and does not include the entire universe of data breaches. Originality/value: In the quest to reduce data breach incidents, it is imperative to identify and assess the nature of data breach incidents between industries. Doing so permits the development of targeted industry-specific solutions rather than generic ones. This study systematically identifies differences between hospitality and non-hospitality data security incidents and then suggests areas where hospitality companies should focus future attention to mitigate breach incidents. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089585326

Traditionally, honeypots have been used as decoys to mimic real devices on a network and help researchers/organizations understand the dynamic of threats. A crucial condition for a honeypot to yield useful insights is to let attackers believe they are real systems used by humans and organizations. However, IoT devices pose unique challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device types and the physical-connectedness nature. In this work, we (1) presented an approach to create a multi-phased multi-faceted honeypot ecosystem, where researchers gradually increase the sophistication of a low-interaction IoT honeypot by observing real-world attackers' behaviors, (2) built a low-interaction honeypot for IoT cameras that allowed researchers to gain a concrete understanding of what attackers were going after on IoT camera devices, and (3) designed a proxy instance, called ProxyPot, that sits between IoT devices and the external network and helps researchers study the IoT devices' inbound/outbound communication. We used PorxyPot as a means to understanding attacks against IoT cameras and increasing the honeypot's sophistication. We deployed honeypots for more than two years.

In the last few months, we have witnessed new treads and waves of cyber-Attacks targeting businesses, governments, health, and other critical services. Attackers try to take advantage of people's fear of the virus, vulnerabilities associated with data collection sensors and IoT devices, and eagerness to look for solutions or protections. In this study, we will survey the nature of cyberattacks related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Them, we will analyze related data to phishing attacks using Neural Networks. This analysis is covering different technical and socio-economical aspects. We will also evaluate states' countermeasures in response to such attacks. We propose a new IoT model.

In the big data era, these applications demand fast and versatile anomaly detection capability to handle various types of increasingly huge-volume data. However, existing detection methods are either slow due to high computational complexity, or unable to deal with complicated anomalies like local anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection method named OPHiForest with the use of the order preserving hashing based isolation forest. The core idea is to learn the information from data to construct better isolation forest structure than the state-of-the-art methods like iForest and LSHiForest, which can achieve robust detection of various anomaly types. We design a fast two-step learning process for the order preserving hashing scheme. This leads to stronger order preservation for better hashing, and therefore enhances anomaly detection robustness and accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our method is highly robust and scalable. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095865984

Early identification of emerging security threats from such information is an important part of security for deployed software and systems. While several cybersecurity event detection methods have been proposed to extract security events from unstructured text in open data sources, most of the existing methods focus on detecting events that have a large volume of mentions. On the contrary, to respond faster than attackers, security analysts and IT operators need to be aware of critical security events as early as possible, no matter how many mentions about an event are made. In this paper, we propose a novel event detection system that can quickly identify critical security events, such as new threats and resurgence of an attack or related event, from Twitter regardless of their volume of mentions. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed method triggers events by monitoring new words and re-emerging words, making it possible to narrow down candidate events among several hundreds of events. It then forms events by clustering tweets linked with the trigger words. This approach enables us to detect new and resurgent threats as early as possible. We empirically demonstrate that our system works promisingly over a wide range of threat types. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096382446

We offer mitigating strategies to reduce unintended consequences, maximize patient safety, and enhance health care delivery. Methods We searched PubMed and other sources to identify articles describing EHR-to-EHR transitions. We combined these references with the authors' extensive experience to construct a conceptual schema and to offer recommendations to facilitate transitions. Results Our PubMed query retrieved 1,351 citations: 43 were relevant for full paper review and 18 met the inclusion criterion of focus on EHR-to-EHR transitions. An additional PubMed search yielded 1,014 citations, for which we reviewed 74 full papers and included 5. We supplemented with additional citations for a total of 70 cited. We distinguished 10 domains in the literature that overlap yet present unique and salient opportunities for successful transitions and for problem mitigation. Discussion There is scant literature concerning EHR-to-EHR transitions. Identified challenges include financial burdens, personnel resources, patient safety threats from limited access to legacy records, data integrity during migration, cybersecurity, and semantic interoperability. Transition teams must overcome inadequate human infrastructure, technical challenges, security gaps, unrealistic providers' expectations, workflow changes, and insufficient training and support-all factors affecting potential clinician burnout. Conclusion EHR transitions are remarkably expensive, laborious, personnel devouring, and time consuming. The paucity of references in comparison to the topic's salience reinforces the necessity for this type of review and analysis. Prudent planning may streamline EHR transitions and reduce expenses. Mitigating strategies, such as preservation of legacy data, managing expectations, and hiring short-term specialty consultants can overcome some of the greatest hurdles. A new medical subject headings (MeSH) term for EHR transitions would facilitate further research on this topic. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

One of them is cyber-situational awareness as well as dynamic and static risk analysis. A specific design method for a multimodal human-computer interface (HCI) for cyber-security events visualisation control is presented. The main role of the interface is to support security analysts and network operators in their monitoring activities. The proposed method of designing HCIs is adapted from the methodology of robot control system design. Both kinds of systems act by acquiring information from the environment, and utilise it to drive the devices influencing the environment. In the case of robots the environment is purely physical, while in the case of HCIs it encompasses both the physical ambience and part of the cyber-space. The goal of the designed system is to efficiently support a human operator in the presentation of cyberspace events such as incidents or cyber-attacks. Especially manipulation of graphical information is necessary. As monitoring is a continuous and tiring activity, control of how the data is presented should be exerted in as natural and convenient way as possible. Hence two main visualisation control modalities have been assumed for testing: Static and dynamic gesture commands and voice commands, treated as supplementary to the standard interaction. The presented multimodal interface is a component of the Operational Centre, which is a part of the National Cybersecurity Platform. Creation of the interface out of embodied agents proved to be very useful in the specification phase and facilitated the interface implementation. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

In the current era of major technological changes, blockchain technology, with its cryptographic structure, peer-to-peer (P2P) network, consensus mechanism, smart contract and other mechanisms, is decentralized, tamper-proof, and traceable and has become a hot spot in the development of informatization. Classified protection is one of the basic policies of information security in China. The implementation of the information security level protection system can not only guide various industries in performing security management in accordance with the equivalent security standards, but also ensure that supervision and evaluation institutions follow the laws and regulations, which is of significance to network security. As the application of blockchain technology in various industries is becoming more extensive, it is necessary to simultaneously promote the national classified protection of blockchain security assessment, which contributes to the sustainable and healthy development of blockchains in China. According to the revised assessment methods of grade protection, in addition to the status of universality requirements, evaluation specifications should be formulated for specific technologies and fields (such as cloud computing, mobile Internet, Internet of Things, industrial control, and big data). In view of the particularity of blockchain technology, China has initiated the formulation of blockchain evaluation specifications, but has not applied the level protection standards to the formulation of blockchain evaluation specifications. Therefore, the assessment requirements and enforcement proposals are specified for the blockchain's core technologies, such as P2P network, distributed ledger, consensus mechanism, and smart contracts, according to the application and data security layer requirements at Level 3. Moreover, the current running data of blockchains and their security audit mechanism based on the log workflow were summarized and analyzed respectively in compliance with the control points specified in classified protection 2.0. Our investigation indicates that blockchains can satisfy the requirements of evaluation items in three aspects, namely, software fault tolerance, resource control, and backup and recovery. However, further improvements are needed for other aspects, including security audit, access control, identification and authentication, and data integrity.

In this study, we have used the event study methodology and standard market model (MM) to observe the effect of the data privacy breach on the firm performance. We have also observed the impact of firm-specific characteristics (such as firm size and firm type) and attack-specific characteristics (such as attack type and damage potency) on the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) due to privacy breaches. We have used data of 131 data privacy breaches related to US firms for the years 2012 (43 breaches), 2013 (37 breaches), and 2014 (51 breaches).

To evaluate the effective- ness of the proposed methods, we conducted experiments on a real test bed representing the substation domain as close to real-world as possible. From this test bed we collect data during normal operation and during situations where the system is under attack. To this end several different types of attack are conducted. The data collected is used to test two versions of the mon- itoring system: one based on machine learning with a neural network and one using a model-checking approach.

A centralized controller must assign an authentication method to each request, considering the type, the state of the system and the characteristics of several available methods. Each authentication method has different capacity, service rate, level of security, level of usability and operating cost. We seek to optimize security, usability and operating cost, simultaneously by assigning authentication methods dynamically, in real time. To do this, we model the system as a network of parallel multi-server queues, where each queue represents an authentication method and each customer represents a request. We use two different approaches to handle the multiple objectives: a weighted total cost function, and treating security and latency as constraints while minimizing operating cost. We employ constrained and unconstrained Markov decision processes to determine the structure of policies that effectively balance these three objectives. We conclude that if there are infinitely many servers for each authentication method, then the optimal policy is static. We also show that if one method has finite capacity, then the optimal policy is of trunk reservation form. Our results regarding the structure of the optimal policy are consistent for both modeling approaches. Our work shows that optimal policies have intuitive, easy-to-implement structures that are useful in practice. Under certain assumptions, we provide a straightforward way to obtain an optimal policy. We also offer strategies to use our models to explore non-dominated solutions over the three objective functions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066020572

While early cyber deception systems (e.g., honeypots) were largely static, recent approaches leverage computational game theory and machine learning techniques to allow for dynamic deception strategies that can potentially observe, react, and adapt to an adversary in both the short and long term. However, applying these theoretical models and algorithms in real-world settings poses additional considerations that are not always apparent in theory. Currently, testbeds and experimentation platforms for dynamic deception are lacking, limiting the ability of researchers and analysts to test and evaluate these approaches using realistic scenarios and data.Honeypots are a technology where these dynamic deception methods can have a great impact on effectiveness. The basic technology to mimic nodes and network services has been used for several decades and is effective against less experienced adversaries, but is less useful against sophisticated intruders. Using adaptation, behavior-based model development and reasoning and other artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to make honeypots much more effective against experienced adversaries by making them less predictable and more targeted. Before these novel technologies can be used in the real world, it is critical that they are tested and validated on realistic systems and in realistic settings.We present the Cybersecurity Deception Experimentation System (CDES) that extends the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) to provide a platform that is capable of evaluating dynamic deception algorithms. We also provide three case studies that demonstrate how CDES can be used to practically implement dynamic honeypots in increasingly complex scenarios and discuss some nuances of each implementation. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096642281

In this article we argue that advances in global climate governance appear to be offering an early model of a consensual rules-based approach within the existing international order that provides space for advancing agility, flexibility, and polycentrism to meet the demands of ‘wicked problems’ like the cybersecurity of the IoT. Perhaps one of the most important lessons to be drawn across from climate governance is the role of robust mechanisms for knowledge exchange – specifically between the technical and policy communities. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091045435

Future-generation networks (5G and beyond 5G) will include a variety of services for various verticals, such as enhanced mobile broadband, health monitoring, Industry 4.0, smart energy distribution, and automotive networks. These vertical services and the critical components that comprise 5G architecture (e.g., radio access and edge and core networks) exhibit several cybersecurity vulnerabilities that attract attackers to use all their capabilities to exploit and hence shut down these networks. Recently, a new generation of smart threats, defined as artificial intelligence (AI ) attacks, has appeared. These smart attacks either turn AI into weapons to attack 5G services or hack the AI algorithms used by 5G components. In the first misbehavior, attackers take advantage of AI's improved ability to launch lethal and stealthy threats against attractive targets, e.g., autonomous vehicles, drones, or manufacturing machinery. In the second misbehavior, attackers hack machine learning (ML) algorithms by modifying, for instance, the labels of the ML classification functions and altering the training data, causing a decrease in the accuracy of the classification rate. © 2020 IEEE.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090234938

However, we have a limited understanding of the contexts and mechanisms that affect the likelihood of failures and successes in mHealth data protection, and their subsequent impacts. In this review and theory development paper, we aim to address this critical knowledge gap. Method: We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. To synthesize the evidence, we adopted a realist review approach and compiled the extracted information based on context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations. Out of an initial set of 611 records, 19 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included. Results: Our findings indicate that the failures and successes in data protection and their impacts (effective mHealth interventions, data protection awareness, and adoption/use of mHealth systems) depend contingently upon a number of contextual factors (systems, users, tasks, services, geographic elements) and causal mechanisms (unauthorized access, device theft, loss, and sharing, lack of cyber-hygiene, and data protection concerns for failures, and trust building activity, secure and law compliant platforms, and perceived data protection, for successes). We conceptualized the CMO configurations to provide explanations for the reported failures and successes in data protection. Conclusion: For effective mHealth interventions, the dark side of system use (data breaches) must be mitigated and remediated. Our study offers a theoretical model that contextually explains how the mechanisms of success and failures work in mHealth. © 2020",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088041820

The cyber domain is particularly dynamic: new concepts are constantly developed and need new terminological designations, which in turn need new counterparts in other languages. Formation of these designations and their counterparts often raises terminological issues that are important to deal with in order to develop a coherent system of the cyber domain terms. The given paper focuses on the terminology that includes the lexical item cyber which may be considered as the main signifier of the cyber domain indicating its specific nature. The aim of the paper is threefold: to analyse the origin and development of the lexical item cyber, to investigate conceptual categories of the EU legislation terminology that includes the lexical item cyber and to establish the Lithuanian counterparts that are used for translation of the lexical item cyber in the Lithuanian equivalents of the English terms. For the purposes of the study, the ad hoc English and Lithuanian corpora of the EU legislative documents were compiled.

The increasing variety of devices that can access to Internet has contributed to the overall growth of internet users, in all kinds of places and circumstances. These devices are now part of our lives and we use it for everything. As the number of devices and tasks that we do with it are growing, more prone we are to cyber-attacks.

Multiple heterogeneous MAS networks can be integrated together as a multilayer MAS network to offer holistic services. The network connectivity of the multilayer MAS plays an important role in the information exchange between agents within and across different layers of the network. In this article, we establish a games-in-games framework to capture the uncoordinated nature of decision making under adversarial environment at different layers. Specifically, each network operator controls the mobile agents in his own subnetwork and designs a secure strategy to maximize the global network connectivity by considering the behavior of jamming attackers that aim to disconnect the network. The solution concept of metaequilibrium is proposed to characterize the system-of-systems behavior of the autonomous agents. For online implementation of the control, we design a resilient algorithm that improves the network algebraic connectivity iteratively. We show that the designed algorithm converges to a metaequilibrium asymptotically. Finally, we use case studies of a two-layer MAS network to corroborate the security and agile resilience of the network controlled by the proposed strategy. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072643906

As more organizations experience crippling security breaches, the wave of compromised data is growing significantly. The financial consequences of a data breach are set on the rise, but the cost goes beyond potential fines. Data breaches could have a catastrophic impact not only in loss of company's reputation and stock price, but also in economic terms. Threat Intelligence has been recently introduced to enable greater visibility of cyber threats, in order to better protect organizations' digital assets and prevent data breaches. Threat intelligence is the practice of integrating and analyzing disjointed cyber data to extract evidence-based insights regarding an organization's unique threat landscape. This helps explain who the adversary is, how and why they are comprising the organization's digital assets, what consequences could happen following the attack, what assets actually could be compromised, and how to detect or respond to the threat. Every organization is different and threat intelligence frameworks are custom-tailored to the business process itself and the organization's risks, as there is no “one-size-fits-all” in cyber. In this paper, we review the problem of data breaches and discuss the challenges of implementing threat intelligence that scales in today's complex threat landscape and digital infrastructure. This is followed by an illustration of how the future of effective threat intelligence is closely linked to efficiently applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning approaches, and we conclude by outlining future research directions in this area. © Copyright © 2020 Ibrahim, Thiruvady, Schneider and Abdelrazek.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104202907

Leveraging the review of literature, this paper aims to explore the strategic decisions made by organizations when implementing cybersecurity controls, and identifies economic models and theories from the economics of information security, and information security investment decision-making process. Using a survey study method, this paper explores the feasibility for development of a strategic decision-making framework that may be used when evaluating and implementing cybersecurity measures. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the ways in which decisions are made as it relates to cybersecurity spending. The purpose of the pilot study was to determine the feasibility for developing a strategic framework to minimize cybersecurity risks. Phase 1 – Interview Study: The qualitative approach focused on seven participants who provided input to refine the survey study questionnaire. Phase 2 – Survey Study: The qualitative approach focused on information gathered through an online descriptive survey study using a five-point Likert scale. Findings: The literature review identified that there is limited research in the area of information security decision making. One paper was identified within this area, focusing on the research completed by Dor and Elovici [22]. This exploratory research demonstrates that although organizations have actively implemented cybersecurity frameworks, there is a need to enhance the decision-making process to reduce the number and type of breaches, along with strengthening the cybersecurity framework to facilitate a preventative approach. Research limitations/implications: The partnership research design could be expanded to facilitate quantitative and qualitative techniques in parallel with equal weight, leveraging qualitative techniques, an interview study, case study and grounded theory. In-depth data collection and analysis can be completed to facilitate a broader data collection which will provide a representative sample and achieve saturation to ensure that adequate and quality data are collected to support the study. Quantitative analysis through statistical techniques (i.e. regression analysis) taking into account, the effectiveness of cybersecurity frameworks, and the effectiveness of decisions made by stakeholders on implementing cybersecurity measures. Practical implications: This exploratory research demonstrates that organizations have actively implemented cybersecurity measure; however, there is a need to reduce the number and type of breaches, along with strengthening the cybersecurity framework to facilitate a preventative approach. In addition, factors that are used by an organization when investing in cybersecurity controls are heavily focused on compliance with government and industry regulations along with opportunity cost. Lastly, the decision-making process used when evaluating, implementing and investing in cybersecurity controls is weighted towards the technology organization and, therefore, may be biased based on competing priorities. Social implications: The outcome of this study provides greater insight into how an organization makes decisions when implementing cybersecurity controls. This exploratory research shows that most organizations are diligently implementing security measures to effectively monitor and detect cyber security attacks. The pilot study revealed that the importance given to the decisions made by the CIO and Head of the Business Line have similar priorities with regard to funding the investment cost, implementing information security measures and reviewing the risk appetite statement. This parallel decision-making process may potentially have an adverse impact on the decision to fund cybersecurity measures, especially in circumstances where the viewpoints are vastly different . Originality/value: Cybersecurity spend is discussed across the literature, and various approaches, methodologies and models are used. The aim of this paper is to explore the strategic decision-making approach that is used by organizations when evaluating and implementing cybersecurity measures. Using a survey study method, this paper explores the feasibility for development of a strategic decision-making framework that may be used when evaluating and implementing cybersecurity measures. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084463251

The two models are trained independently such that the feature extraction model aims to extract useful features from the continuous-time signals that are then used along with the binary actuator signals to train the isolation forest-based detection model.

Through a discursive analysis of IBM corporate texts, webpages, and the 2017 New Collar Jobs Act, I argue for New Collar work to be understood through the lens of autonomy, as IBM recasts notions of ‘autonomous’ technology onto humans by downplaying dystopic associations of technological autonomy and transferring notions of autonomy to human workers. In doing so, I account for IBM’s use of ‘augmentation’ to situate human intelligence as the cognitive force uplifted by work performed with artificial intelligence. By pairing human augmentation with posthumanist conceptions of ‘distributed cognition’, IBM centers human intelligence through a redistributed cognition that reverses posthumanism’s decentering of human supremacy. Following from this, I unpack ‘New Collar’ as a reinvention of ‘white’ and ‘blue’ collar dichotomies and New Collar work as the grounds for tech workers to reinvent themselves. In this way, by minimizing the necessity of 4-year college degrees as pathways to economic and professional mobility, IBM constructs ‘New Collar’ with embedded notions of enlarged self-determination for applied worker intellect, vocational training, and employability. Under the aegis of creating, training, and employing New Collar workers, IBM pursues policy outcomes to underwrite corporate ventures related to New Collar work and bolster its institutional autonomy amidst marketplaces of cognitive capitalism. By outlining how tax relief provisions of the New Collar Jobs Act correlate with neoliberal ideologies of legislators and IBM investments in public–private vocational models and cybersecurity platforms, I account for IBM’s elongated ‘economy of learning’ that enables the company to more thoroughly capture, underwrite, and commodify New Collar cognition from training to market outputs. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078487739

The automotive plants are among the factories that could implement most of these technologies. Industry 4.0 can affect all of the processes which happen in the automotive industry manufacturing plants - engineering, production, logistics, management, etc. Analysis of all of the processes in one article is too complex task and due to this the paper is focused only on logistics and supply chain. The aim of this article is to investigate the potential possibilities for implementation of Logistics 4.0 and Supply Chain 4.0 in the automotive industry plants, in particular in Bulgaria. Specially designed survey was used as investigation method. It consists of two groups with proposals and assumptions. The survey was conducted by 12 automotive industry logistics experts who are on 6 different logistics positions. The results show that the production visibility (assembly lines connected to internet) and blockchain technologies have the biggest values to the logistics and supply chain.

This study aims to expand the domain of health-care cyber security maturity model by including cloud-specific aspects than is usually seen in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: The intended use of the proposed model was demonstrated using the evaluation method – “construct validity test” as the paper’s aim was to assess the final model and the output of the valuation. The study involved a literature-based case study of a national health-care foundation trust with an overall view because the model is assessed for the entire organisation. The data were complemented by examination of hospitals’ cyber security internal processes through web-accessible documents, and identified relevant literature. Findings: The paper provides awareness about how organisational-related challenges have been identified as a main inhibiting factor for the adoption of cloud computing in health care. Regardless of the remunerations of cloud computing, its security maturity and levels of adoption varies, especially in health care. Maturity models provide a structure towards improving an organisation’s capabilities. It suggests that although several cyber security maturity models and standards resolving specific threats exist, there is a lack of maturity models for cloud-based health-care security. Research limitations/implications: Due to the selected research method, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, future research studies can investigate the propositions further. Another is that the current thresholds were determined empirically, although it worked for the case study assessment. However, to establish more realistic threshold levels, there is a need for more validation of the model using more case studies. Practical implications: The paper includes maturity model for the assessment management and improvement of the security posture of a health-care organisation actively using cloud. For executives, it provides a detailed security assessment of the eHealth cloud to aid in decision making. For security experts, its quantitative metrics support proactive and reactive processes. Originality/value: The paper fulfils a recognised requirement for security maturity model focussed on health-care cloud. It could be extended to resolve evolving cyber settings. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077575763

The security index is constructed based on outgoing spams and phishing website hosting, which may serve as an indicator of a firm’s security controls. To study whether security vulnerability awareness causes firms to improve their security, we conducted a randomized field experiment on 1,262 firms in six Pan-Asian countries and regions. Among 631 randomly selected treated firms, we alerted them of their security vulnerability index and their relative rankings compared to their peers via advisory emails and websites. Difference-in-differences analyses show that compared with the controls, the treated firms improve their security over time, with a statistically significant reduction of outgoing spam volume according to one of the data sources but not phishing website hosting. However, a statistically significant reduction in phishing website hosting was observed among non-web hosting firms, suggesting that firms’ underlying incentives play an important role in the treatment effect. Lastly, exploiting the multi-country nature of the data, we found that firms in countries with high information and communications technology (ICT) development are more responsive to our intervention because they have higher IT capabilities and more resources to resolve security issues. Our study provides cybersecurity policymakers with useful insights on how firm incentives and ICT environments play roles in firms’ security measure adoption. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096184756

Current fleets are increasingly looking toward converting to digital I&C systems due to the advantages of precise control, economic operation, and ease of procurement over conventional analog I&C systems. With all the benefits digital I&C systems bring, challenging cybersecurity concerns are introduced as well. Cyberattacks targeted at industrial control systems have grown in both frequency and capability in recent years. Despite efforts to air-gap digital I&C systems, NPPs can be vulnerable to these cyberattacks, as evidenced by recent cyber incidents at nuclear facilities. Cybersecurity of NPPs should be addressed in three complementary thrusts: cyberattack prevention, detection, and response. Considering the requirements of digital I&C systems, we propose a novel cybersecurity solution platform that consists of a data collection and extraction system, a multilayer cyberattack detection system, a cause analysis system with dynamic risk assessment, a cyberattack response system, and a main control room display system. This architecture also promotes cooperation between information technology experts and the operation technology team to improve cybersecurity by integrating process data together with traditional host system and network data in a unified platform. This paper presents the proposed cybersecurity architecture and demonstrates its efficacy with a simulated cyberattack on a cyber-physical system testbed. Together with traditional intrusion prevention methods and rule-based intrusion detection systems, this platform provides a solution for prevention, detection, and response to cyberattacks that is congruous with the defense-in-depth strategies of other NPP safety and security systems. © 2019, © 2019 American Nuclear Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074555719

To protect users from such cyberattacks, we propose a deep neural network for detecting malicious JavaScript codes by examining their bytecode sequences. We use the V8 JavaScript compiler to generate a bytecode sequence, which corresponds to an abstract form of machine codes. The benefit of using bytecode representation is that we can easily break complex obfuscation in JavaScript. To identify the attacker's malicious intention, We adopt a deep pyramid convolutional neural network (DPCNN) combining with recurrent neural network models, which can handle long-range associations in a bytecode sequence. In our experiment, various recurrent networks are testified to encode temporal features of code behaviors, and our results show that the proposed approach provides high accuracy in detection of malicious JavaScript. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093856833

Moreover, through the sharing of local training data, the centralized learning approach has proven to improve a model's performance. In this research, a segmented federated learning is proposed, different from a collaborative learning based on single global model in a traditional federated learning model, it keeps multiple global models which allow each segment of participants to conduct collaborative learning separately and rearranges the segmentation of participants dynamically as well. Furthermore, these multiple global models interact with each other for updating parameters, thus being adaptable to various participants' LANs. A dataset covering two months' traffic data from 20 participants' LANs in the LAN-Security Monitoring Project is used.

The process of mining this data is very challenging since a lot of the data suffers from the problem of high dimensionality. The quandary of high dimensionality represents a great challenge that can be controlled through the process of feature selection. Feature selection is a complex task with multiple layers of difficulty. To be able to grasp and realize the impediments associated with high dimensional data a more and in-depth understanding of feature selection is required.

We test its effect on the performance of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and compare its performance to conventional machine learning algorithms. We establish that when certain features that are representative of the model are to be selected the change in the accuracy was always less than 3% across all algorithms. This verifies that the accurate selection of the important features when building a model can have a significant impact on the accuracy level of the classifiers.

This exercise can be effective in weeding out data localization measures disguised as privacy/ cybersecurity measures, particularly by employing relevant technical and factual evidence.

XIV has a limited role, particularly in cases involving direct conflict between multistakeholder/transnational internet norms and domestic internet policies, or where the measures are founded on contentious standards/benchmarks on privacy/cybersecurity.

It has been apparent for several years that industrial systems are vulnerable to computer attacks. This can be explained because they were not designed with security constraints, particularly because of their physical isolation from Internet. However, they now face a variety of attackers with different objectives and abilities. In this paper, we present our strategy of cybersecurity, based on machine learning algorithms, applied in the context of industry 4.0. For this purpose, Unified Threat Management based on machine learning algorithms (ML-UTM) was used. to touch all layers of pyramid of Computer Integrated Manufacturing we propose to put an ML-UTM between layer 4 and 3, and an Industrial Unified Threat Management based on machine learning algorithms (ML-IUTM) between layer 3 and 2, another ML-IUTM between layer 2 and 1. Then we will cite the works based on the use of filtering device between layers 1 and 0. This paper describes a machine learning approach to build an efficient and accurate network intrusion detection system, which is one of the features of UTM, using a hybrid method. Thus, we have combined the different machine learning algorithms, namely Support vector machine (SVM), One rule (OneR), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and Random forest (RF) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method using a real data set (Gas pipeline), and according to the results of our analysis, we have selected the best optimized classifier. The experimental results have demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of the proposed approach. The PSO method can provide various advantages to K-NN and RF classifiers such as higher accuracy, lower MSE and faster time to build model. After analyzing and comparing all these results it was found that the NIDS based RF optimized by PSO give the best performances, with accuracy of 99.30%, F-measure of 99,30% and MSE that has been reduced to 0,0034. © 2020 Little Lion Scientific.

The built model utilizes Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) to learn long-short term patterns of the driving behaviors from drivers. Additionally, we improve the training time by utilizing the Segmented Feature Generation (SFG) algorithm to reduce the state space where the driving behaviors are split with a time window for analysis.

Specifically, it intends to dissect and critically appraise the work of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC), a multistakeholder consortium composed of 28 regionally-diverse scholars, CEOs and (former) policymakers. Inaugurated at the margins of the 2017 Munich Security Conference, the GCSC has been fairly active with regard to developing proposals for norms and policies to enhance international security and stability and guiding responsible conduct in the virtual realm. Design/methodology/approach: With a view to engaging in a differentiated analysis of the Commission’s activities, this paper asks: How do non-state actors such as the GCSC contribute to processes of cybersecurity norm-making, i.e. what are their roles and responsibilities, and how effective is their engagement? Since the end of the Cold War, non- state actors have become an issue of great interest to scholars of International Relations and International Law. However, in the context of cybersecurity, their normative engagement has not been scrutinised extensively. This paper seeks to address this gap. Findings: Based on a review of secondary literature and case materials, this paper finds that, within a relatively short period of time, the GCSC has managed to exert discernible discursive and political influence over discussions on responsible behaviour in cyberspace and deserves recognition as a shaper of transnational cybersecurity governance. However, while fairly successful across the dimensions of output and outcome, the Commission has struggled to effect far-reaching systemic change (impact). Originality/value: In light of significant contestation and fleeting governmental appetite for enacting red lines in the virtual realm, this paper seeks to critically appraise the contributions of non-state actors to processes of cybersecurity norm-making. The motivation to do so stems from two sources: empirical observations that non-state protagonists have become more involved in issues concerning responsible conduct in cyberspace, and realisations that, so far, academic research has offered little examination of their ideational engagement. Exploring the case of the GCSC, this paper argues that non-state actors have to be taken seriously as normative change agents in cybersecurity governance-related contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085068615

Budgetary constraints have compelled IC designers to offshore manufacturing to third-party companies. When the designer gets the manufactured ICs back, it is imperative to test for potential threats like hardware trojans (HT). In this paper, a novel multi-level game-theoretic framework is introduced to analyze the interactions between a malicious IC manufacturer and the tester. In particular, the game is formulated as a non-cooperative, zero-sum, repeated game using prospect theory (PT) that captures different players' rationalities under uncertainty. The repeated game is separated into a learning stage, in which the defender learns about the attacker's tendencies, and an actual game stage, where this learning is used. Experiments show great incentive for the attacker to deceive the defender about their actual rationality by ""playing dumb""in the learning stage (deception). This scenario is captured using hypergame theory to model the attacker's view of the game. The optimal deception rationality of the attacker is analytically derived to maximize utility gain. For the defender, a first-step deception mitigation process is proposed to thwart the effects of deception. Simulation results show that the attacker can profit from the deception as it can successfully insert HTs in the manufactured ICs without being detected. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092002010

While some robots are well-behaving such as search engines, others can perform DDoS attacks, which put great threats on websites. Effectively detecting web robots will benefit not only for network traffic cleaning, but also for improving the cybersecurity of IoT enabled systems and services. To get the state of the arts in web robot detection, this paper reviews recent decade research on web robot or web robot/crawler detection techniques and compares their performances and identify the challenges of different techniques, thus providing researchers a reference for the development of web robots detection in real applications. To protect web content from malicious web robots, researchers have investigated various approaches, but they can be classified into three themes: offline web log analysis, honeypots and online robot detection. We conclude that off-line web log analysis methods have quite high accuracy, but they are time-consuming compared to online detection methods. Honeypots, as a computer security mechanism, can be used to engage and deceive hackers and identify malicious activities performed over the Internet, but they may block legitimate robots. The review shows that a hybrid method is better than an individual classifier, and the performance of online web robot detection needs to be improved. Also, different types of features could play different roles in different machine learning models. Therefore, feature selection is important for web robot/crawler detection. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092001819

Because of these modular features, the applications of blockchain are being investigated in myriad domains such as cybersecurity, finance, transportation, and Internet-of-things (IoT). Although the applications of blockchain in IoT networks have much potential, many research challenges need the attention of researchers from both academia and industry. One of the open research challenges is the frequent occurrence of forking events in blockchain-based IoT networks. The forking of a blockchain can not only lead to potential security attacks but also poses excessive overhead in the largescale IoT networks. To tackle this inefficiency of blockchain-based IoT networks, this paper employs deep learning to minimize forking by reducing the transmission delays. Specifically, a deep neural network is used to reduce the transmission delay by improving the transmission rate. The deep learning approach is also compared with other benchmark techniques to show the superiority of the proposed method. We anticipate that this foundational work on blockchain-based IoT networks would pave the way for researchers to upscale the study into real-world implementations. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090270076

A content analysis was performed of documents issued between January 2017 and mid-2018, consisting of recent annual information forms (AIFs), annual and quarterly management's discussion and analysis (MD&As), proxy circulars, material change reports, and news releases. To assess the nature and extent of cybersecurity disclosure, we developed a scoring grid featuring 40 items based on financial regulators' guidelines. Results show that cybersecurity disclosure levels are low. Companies vary widely in the amount of detail they provide, and the information is often not company-specific. The variations among industrial sectors involve the categories related to cybersecurity risk, cybersecurity risk mitigation, and other items. Most of the companies provided cybersecurity disclosures in the annual MD&A, and several reiterated some disclosure items in the AIF and proxy circular. The results of this study highlight some areas where cybersecurity disclosures have evolved and others where they could be improved.

In active defenses, representing the focus of this paper, known signatures, synthesized based on the system's unique characteristics, are inserted into the system. In contradistinction, passive methods rely solely on observing system behavior in search of patterns of normal behavior with deviations thereof representing abnormal behavior. In their most sophisticated implementations, both passive and active defenses rely on the use of data analytics to identify the patterns and synthesize the observed and/or inserted signatures. Past research has shown that passive defenses may be bypassed by APT actors relying on data analytics and their intimate knowledge of the system to evade detection by respecting the patterns identified by the defenders. Thus, this manuscript explores the use of active defenses under the assumption that the attacker has privileged access to the system, including access to the system's model and sensors data. Specifically, this manuscript assesses the ability of active defenses to remain invisible to the attackers, and discusses the associated challenges that must be addressed to ensure their resiliency against APT actors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082777020

In particular, indirect externalities arise in the cloud from connecting users with developers of complementary products or services. The premise investigated here is that a cloud provider's security is subject to the same rigors of two-sided market competition that shape a cloud provider's pricing and strategy. In so doing, this study demonstrates how cybersecurity shapes cloud competition and cloud competition shapes cybersecurity. Specifically, cybersecurity is shown to be a user-side phenomenon with characteristics that can lead to the coexistence of cloud services providers rather than monopoly. In addition, a user's switching costs are characterized in terms of the ratio of the potential consequence of a class break under a user's current provider against that of the competition.

Therefore, this study garnered a descriptive understanding of security and facility professionals’ knowledge of BACS, including vulnerabilities and mitigation practices. Results indicate that the majority of security and facility professionals hold a general awareness of BACS security issues, although they lacked a robust understanding to meet necessary protection. For instance, understanding of 23 BACS vulnerabilities were found to be equally critical with limited variance. Mitigation strategies were no better, with respondents indicating poor threat diagnosis. In contrast, cybersecurity and technical security professionals such as integrators or security engineering design professionals displayed a robust understanding of BACS vulnerabilities and resulting mitigation strategies.

The method allows detecting both known and unknown cyberattacks. The method has the heuristic nature and is based on the collected data about the cyberattacks.

The mechanism of attack detection system is based on the cyberattacks' features gathering from network or hosts, extracting the subset of acquired set and generation the attacks' detection rules. Genetic algorithms are used for the minimization of the feature set, which allows effective using of the system resources for attacks detection. In order to detect the attacks, the proposed technique involves the rule generation. The attacks' features are described by the set of sub-rules. It is suggested to use the feature with the smallest domain for generating the minimal set for rules. It is possible to select the optimal feature after all selected features which were discovered while applying the genetic algorithm.

Although these systems are critical to ensuring the efficiency and safety of our airspace, they are also increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats that could potentially lead to reduction in capacity and/or reorganization of traffic flows. In this article, we model various cyber threats to ATC systems and analyze how these attacks could impact the flow of aircraft through the airspace. To perform this analysis, we consider a model for wide-area air traffic based on a dynamic queuing network model. Then we introduce three different attacks (Route Denial of Service, Route Selection Tampering, and Sector Denial of Service) to the ATC system and explore how these attacks manipulate the sector flows by evaluating the queue backlogs for each sector's outflows. Furthermore, we explore graph-level vulnerability metrics to identify the sectors that are most vulnerable to various flow manipulations and compare them to case-study simulations of the various attacks. The results suggest that Route Denial of Service attacks have a significant impact on the target sector and lead to the largest degradation to the overall air traffic flows. Furthermore, the impact of Sector Denial of Service attack impacts are primarily confined to the target sector, whereas Route Selection Tampering impacts are mostly confined to certain aircraft. © 2020 ACM.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085480921

The findings in this study indicate that China’s approach to the governance of Internet information possesses the following essential features: the clarification of the dialectical relationship between Internet freedom and order, the unification of carrying forward positive energy and restraining negative information, the people-oriented and bottom-up participatory approach to the ecological governance of Internet information, as well as the strictly prohibitive conducts of three key administrative counterparts. The underlying reasons for choosing such an ecological path to regulate the Internet information can be attributed to China’s national configuration, including its political system, cultural tradition, status quo of the Internet development, and the pervasive cybersecurity challenges facing its society. It is thus argued that the governance of Internet information, characteristic of spatiality, can merely be construed within specific socio-political and cultural contexts.

Balancing individual privacy with data security is vital in the information age, especially considering the increasing risk of data breaches and exploitation.In order to increase privacy in a cashless society, a few courses of action can be combined to produce a lasting and desirable result for users: A new kind of banking service that assigns randomized numbers to credit cards, the use of blockchain to monitor all transactions from individuals, and a campaign to educate and inform key stakeholders about security and privacy risks to provide the necessary tools and background knowledge to safeguard their own information before interaction with a foreign entity or other third parties (i.e. cybersecurity departments, IT technicians, etc). Blockchain and card number randomization are both susceptible to zero-day errors, bugs, and varied levels of social acceptance. This preliminary research draws on a systems analysis of cashless systems to identify and analyze a set of social and technical solutions to support a robust cashless system that protects users' privacy and maintains the security of the system.The information found and analyzed will be beneficial by exposing weak points in current methods of data integrity and security. Learning about current and future methods of managing privacy and data security in the technological age would be helpful in creating preventative countermeasures.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS), which monitor an industrial control system (ICS) network traffic and detect suspicious activities, are a necessity for the operation of ICSs. Previous studies argued that packet intervals could ideally be regarded as indicators of the cyber-attacks on ICSs and proposed an intrusion detection methodology relying on packet intervals using singular spectrum analysis (SSA). SSA is a nonparametric spectral estimation method, but it suffers from high computational cost. Thus, in this study, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model was developed based on the packet intervals during steady-state operation, and an intrusion detection method using the LSTM model was proposed. The LSTM model is a recurrent neural network model and can be used for time-series prediction problems. Furthermore, we evaluated the proposed method on a cybersecurity testbed using penetration tests. The results show that the LSTM model performs better than SSA and suggests the possibility of the application of the LSTM model to IDS for various types of plants by adjusting its complexity. © 2020 WITPress.

However, providing visibility and operational situational awareness of BTM solar systems mainly operated by small-scale solar inverters is challenging due to the requirement of relatively expansive networked observation tools (e.g., micro phasor measurement units (μPMUs)) and consequent cybersecurity threats through networks. This paper presents a secure, cost-effective, μPMUs-like metering method using a blockchain-assisted smart (BAS) inverters for a BTM solar system. The proposed BAS inverter consisting of an internet of things device as a node of a local blockchain network enables the secure provision of inverter measurement data for grid services. The BAS inverter sends the encrypted local measurement data with a timestamp to a local blockchain miner. Once the blockchain miner generates a tamper-resistant metering ledger including the measurements, it is used to assess the situational awareness of the BTM solar system. The concept of the proposed metering using the BAS inverters is validated by experimental studies. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087781204

In signature-based detection, not only do attackers bypass known signatures, but they also exploit unknown vulnerabilities. As the number of new signatures is increasing daily, it is also challenging to scale the detection mechanisms without impacting performance. For anomaly detection, defining normal behaviors is challenging due to today’s complex applications with dynamic features. These complex and dynamic characteristics cause much false positives with a simple outlier detection. In this work, we detect intrusion behaviors by looking at number of computing elements together in time and space, whereas most of existing intrusion detection systems focus on a single element. In order to define the spatiotemporal intrusion patterns, we look at fundamental behaviors of cyberattacks that should appear in any possible attacks. We define these individual behaviors as basic cyberattack action (BCA) and develop a stochastic graph model to represent combination of BCAs in time and space. In addition, we build an intrusion detection system to demonstrate the detection mechanism based on the graph model. We inject numerous known and possible unknown attacks comprising BCAs and show how the system detects these attacks and how to locate the root causes based on the spatiotemporal patterns. The characterization of attacks in spatiotemporal patterns with expected essential behaviors would present a new effective approach to the intrusion detection. © 2020 by the authors.

Unlike other defense mechanisms that try to block the attack or simply notify of its existence, the VSM mechanism responds to a detected intrusion by limiting the vehicle's functionality to safe operations and optionally activating additional security countermeasures. This is done by adopting ideas from the existing mechanism of Limp-mode that was originally designed to limit the damage of a mechanical, or an electrical, malfunction and let the vehicle ""limp back home""in safety. Like Limp-mode, the purpose of safe-mode is to limit the vehicle from performing certain functions when conditions arise that could render full operation dangerous: Detecting a malfunction in the Limp-mode case is analogous to detecting an active cybersecurity breach in the safe-mode case, and the reactions should be analogous as well. We demonstrate that the VSM can be implemented, possibly even as an aftermarket add-on: to do so we developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) system and actively tested it in real time on an operating vehicle. Once activated, our VSM system restricts the vehicle to Limp-mode behavior by guiding it to remain in low gear, taking into account the vehicle's speed and the driver's actions. Our system does not require any changes to the electronic control units (ECUs), or to any other part of the vehicle, beyond connecting the safe-mode manager (SMManager) to the correct bus. We note that our system can rely upon any deployed anomaly-detection system to identify the potential attack. We point out that restricting the vehicle to Limp-mode-like behavior by an aftermarket system is just an example. If a car manufacturer would integrate such a system into a vehicle, they would have many more options, and the resulting system would probably be safer and with a better human-machine interface. © 2020 SAE International.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096672809

There are likely to be severe monetary consequences for organizations and its workers who face cyber-attacks. However, currently, little is known on how monetary consequences of cyber-attacks may influence the decision-making of defenders and adversaries. In this research, using a cyber-security game, we evaluate the influence of monetary penalties on decisions made by people performing in the roles of human defenders and adversaries via experimentation and computational modeling. In a laboratory experiment, participants were randomly assigned to the role of “hackers” (adversaries) or “analysts” (defenders) in a laboratory experiment across three between-subject conditions: Equal payoffs (EQP), penalizing defenders for false alarms (PDF) and penalizing defenders for misses (PDM). The PDF and PDM conditions were 10-times costlier for defender participants compared to the EQP condition, which served as a baseline. Results revealed an increase (decrease) and decrease (increase) in attack (defend) actions in the PDF and PDM conditions, respectively. Also, both attack-and-defend decisions deviated from Nash equilibriums. To understand the reasons for our results, we calibrated a model based on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) theory to the attack-and-defend decisions collected in the experiment. The model’s parameters revealed an excessive reliance on recency, frequency, and variability mechanisms by both defenders and adversaries. We discuss the implications of our results to different cyber-attack situations where defenders are penalized for their misses and false-alarms. © Copyright © 2020 Maqbool, Aggarwal, Pammi and Dutt.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079695972

The proposed model is the core of the module of the developed decision support system in the problems of choosing rational investing variants for information protection and cybersecurity of various information objects. The model allows to find financial solutions using the tools of the theory of multistep games with several terminal surfaces. The authors proposed an approach that allows information security management to make a preliminary assessment of strategies for financing the effective cybersecurity systems. The model is distinguished by the assumption that the protection side does not have complete information, both about the financing strategies of the attacking side, and about its financial resources state aimed at overcoming cybersecurity lines of the information object. At the same time, the protection side has the opportunity to obtain additional information by the part of its financial resources. This makes it possible for the protection side to obtain a positive result for itself in the case when it can not be received without this procedure. The solution was found using a mathematical apparatus of a nonlinear multistep quality game with several terminal surfaces with alternate moves.

The aim of this study was to investigate Information Technology (IT) and Medical Technology (MT) personnel’s perception in relation to ongoing segmentation of medical devices and IT infrastructure in the healthcare sector. Methods: Focus group interviews with 9 IT and 9 MT personnel in a county council in southern Sweden were conducted. The interviews focused on two areas: Positive expectations and misgivings. Digital recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Responses related to 2 main areas: Information security and implementation of segmentation. Informants stated that network segmentation would increase the overall level of cybersecurity for medical devices, addressing both insider and outsider threats. However, it would also increase the need for administration and the need for knowledge of the communication patterns of medical devices from the manufacturer’s perspective. Conclusion: IT and MT personnel in a county council in southern Sweden believed that segmentation would increase cybersecurity but also increase administration and resource needs, which are important opinions to take into consideration.

Bitcoin was introduced as the first cryptocurrency to allow direct online payments without relying on centralized financial entities. The use of Bitcoin has vastly grown as a financial asset rather than just a tool for online payments. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies' market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading. In addition, there are other challenges that are specific to the domain of cryptocurrencies such as mining, cybersecurity, anonymity and privacy. In this paper, we survey the application of artificial intelligence techniques to address these challenges for cryptocurrencies with their vast amount of daily transactions, trades and news that are beyond human capabilities to analyze and learn from. This paper discusses the recent research work done in this emerging area and compares them in terms of used techniques and datasets. It also highlights possible research gaps and some potential areas for improvement. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In particular, the artificial intelligence technology represented by the knowledge graph can provide support for complex cyberattack detection and unknown cyberattack detection in multi-source heterogeneous threat intelligence data. Cybersecurity entity recognition is the basis for the construction of threat intelligence knowledge graphs. The composition of security entities in open network text data is very complex, which makes traditional deep learning methods difficult to identify accurately. Based on the pre-training language model of BERT (pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers), a cybersecurity entity recognition model BERT-RDCNN-CRF based on residual dilation convolutional neural network and conditional random field was proposed. The BERT model was used to train the character-level feature vector representation. Combining the residual convolution and the dilation neural network model to effectively extract the important features of the security entity, and finally obtain the BIO annotation of each character through CRF. Experiments on the large-scale cybersecurity entity annotation dataset constructed show that the proposed method achieves better results than the LSTM-CRF model, the BiLSTM-CRF model and the traditional entity recognition model. © 2020, Beijing Xintong Media Co., Ltd..

The following platforms are selected: learning content management systems (open source systems and individual development), Google Classroom service, e-mail, and cloud data storage. The objects of the educational process for which the security state must be provided are shown. Such assets are files (lectures, tasks for laboratory work), a bank of questions (a total set of questions from which tests are created to control knowledge), and grades (for laboratory work and modular control of knowledge). The goal of the work is a comparative analysis of distance learning platforms in the aspect of cybersecurity. The main threats are a violation of the availability and confidentiality of data in the educational process. It is also possible to modify marks due to the exploitation vulnerabilities of the system or gaining access to the functions of the learning content management system administrator. The probability of data being compromised is higher than the probability of modification, as evidenced by information from vulnerability databases about numerous vulnerabilities in learning content management systems. An accessibility violation is a result of a denial of service, that is, the resource on which the necessary files are located becomes inaccessible to users. The method of expert evaluation with variables of fuzzy logic is used. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the most flexible and convenient platform is the learning content management system of individual development, at the same time it is the most unsecure among the platforms considered. An open-source learning content management system is a more secure platform due to the presence of a global community that can identify security problems faster than attackers. Using Google Classroom and using email with cloud storage is safer, but these approaches are inferior in usability and functionality. Conclusions. Choosing a distance-learning platform is about finding a compromise between security and convenience in the form of a wide functionality of the system. When deploying a centralized learning content management system, it is important to remember that this system is an object of critical information infrastructure, and the requirements for critical systems must be met for it. © 2020.

However, the latest regulatory framework is based on the regulatory documents of the past. In this regard, it became necessary to develop new approaches to assessing the security of information and communication systems. One of the options for solving this problem is the use of penetration testing methods. During this procedure, the parameters of the complex protection tools are tested using publicly available tools used by cybercriminals. After completing this procedure, three options for the results are possible, which are described by fuzzy terms: the system meets the requirements of regulatory documents, the system does not comply with the requirements of regulatory documents, the system partially meets the requirements of regulatory documents and needs to be improved. As a result, the problem arises of developing a model that allows obtaining an integral indicator of security based on a fuzzy knowledge base. The article analyzes international documents in the field of cybersecurity and normative documentation of the system of technical protection of information in Ukraine. As the criteria for evaluating the system, the criteria of security against unauthorized access were selected, which in turn are defined in the existing national regulatory documents. A model of a fuzzy hierarchical system for assessing the security profile has been developed, which sets a set of assessment criteria and the sequence of their use. The proposed hierarchical model makes it possible to present the assessment process in an explicit form and implement the process of checking the criteria, indicating the degree of confidence of the expert in the relevance of the assessment criteria. The system was implemented in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox environment of the Matlab application package. Computer experiments have shown the possibility of applying the developed model in practice. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101174103

However, it remains not only unclear how successful these campaigns are in changing behaviour, but also what established behaviour change techniques-if any-they employ in order to achieve this goal. To investigate this, we analysed 17 government-sponsored cybersecurity campaign materials. We coded the materials for their intervention functions according to the Behaviour Change Wheel and their behaviour change techniques in accordance with the Behavioural Change Technique Taxonomy (version 1). Our findings show that security campaigns are often focused on education and increasing awareness, under the assumption that as long as citizens are aware of the risk, and are provided with information on how to improve their security behaviour, behaviour will change. Additionally, there is a lack of published effectiveness studies investigating the direct effects of a governmental cybersecurity campaign.

In each game, the players decide which links to attack/recover and for how long to continue doing so based on a Lyapunov-like function representing the largest difference between the states of the agents. We analyze the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game and obtain an upper bound of the consensus time that is influenced by the strategies of the players.

In the case of construction projects, any cyber breach, either malicious or incidental, has the potential to cause significant damage. This varies from unauthorized access of sensitive project information to hijacking construction equipment to cause structural damage to the site or harm to personnel. Given the potential implications of threats in cyber-physical systems, and the potential for physical damage to products and personnel, serious consideration from a research perspective is needed. The risk of such attacks occurring is exacerbated in regions such as the UAE, where new technologies, such as 3D printing, are trending. With that in mind, the objective of this study is twofold. First, to raise awareness about the cybersecurity implications of the new technologies adopted by the AEC industry. Second, to understand the core cybersecurity aspect of threat modeling concerning cyber-physical systems applied to construction projects. Several threat modeling methods such as STRIDE, OCTAVE, PASTA, and VAST have been developed. However, they are not easy to adopt by construction professionals who generally have limited knowledge of the cybersecurity domain. To address that, this study aims to develop a preliminary threat modeling approach that is relevant to the construction industry and can be quickly adopted to investigate the current technology being implemented. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed threat model, we consider an industrial-grade robotic arm system to 3D print construction elements offsite.

As the fifth generation of wireless networks reaches maturity, several vulnerabilities affecting earlier generations have been resolved. Nevertheless the coexistence of legacy wireless technologies is giving rise to the risk of allowing adversaries to perform downgrade attacks, thus bypassing the improved security of the state-of-the-art communication networks. Vulnerabilities due to the trade-off between security and usability could also exist in the latest wireless networking technologies; hence mobile network operators need to be aware of the risks related to both protocol vulnerabilities and configuration defects. This paper proposes a methodology for the systematic identification of vulnerabilities associated with wireless access protocols and systems and the quantitative evaluation of the resulting risks for mobile operators using attack trees, while considering the current legislative frameworks. The proposed methodology has been designed to aid both, mobile operators towards planning more effective cybersecurity strategies and adopting efficient defences to minimise the probability of an attack and predict its impact on the operational, market and business aspects of mobile network operators. The proposed risk assessment analysis is evaluated over three distinct vertical scenarios, namely an emergency call, a high-speed train commute and a massive public event, with the most relevant threats and their impact being measured and discussed. The evaluation of the model revealed significant results for mobile network operators that are deploying a mix of legacy and state of the art cellular technologies. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098333695

The proposed additions and the development of game models of the interaction of the protection and attacking parties made it possible to develop a decision making algorithm based on a combination of several methods, in particular, expertise, game theory, etc. The practical value of the developed approach is confirmed by its implementation into the computing core of the decision support system for the selection of rational options of information security means (ISM) for ICS. The use of a decision making support system makes it possible to minimize the time spent on choosing rational sets of ISM according to ICS nodes under the conditions of implementation of complex attack scenarios by intruders.

SMEs have specific characteristics which separate them from large companies and influence their adoption of good cybersecurity practices. To mitigate the SMEs’ cybersecurity adoption issues and raise their awareness of cyber threats, we have designed a self-paced security assessment and capability improvement method, CYSEC. CYSEC is a security awareness and training method that utilises self-reporting questionnaires to collect companies’ information about cybersecurity awareness, practices, and vulnerabilities to generate automated recommendations for counselling. However, confidentiality concerns about cybersecurity information have an impact on companies’ willingness to share their information. Security information sharing decreases the risk of incidents and increases users’ self-efficacy in security awareness programs. This paper presents the results of semi-structured interviews with seven chief information security officers (CISOs) of SMEs to evaluate the impact of online consent communication on motivation for information sharing. The results were analysed in respect of the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The findings demonstrate that online consent with multiple options for indicating a suitable level of agreement improved motivation for information sharing.

Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, efficiency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports.

As the increasing spread of IoT applications, IoT security is gradually becoming one of the most significant issues to guard IoT devices against various cybersecurity threats. Usually, IoT devices are the main components responsible for sensing, computing, and transmitting; in this case, how to efficiently protect the IoT device itself away from cyber attacks, like malware, virus, and worm, becomes the vital point in IoT security. This paper presents a brand new architecture of intrusion detection system (IDS) for IoT devices, which is designed to identify device- or host-oriented attacks in a lightweight manner in consideration of limited computation resources on IoT devices. To this end, in this paper, we propose a stacking model to couple the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model together for the abnormal state analysis on the IoT devices. More specifically, we adopt the system call sequence as the indicators of abnormal behaviors. The collected system call sequences are firstly processed by the famous n-gram model, which is a common method used for host-based intrusion detections. Then, the proposed stacking model is used to identify abnormal behaviors hidden in the system call sequences. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we establish a real-setting IP camera system and place several typical IoT attacks on the victim IP camera. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the stacking model has outperformed other existing anomaly detection solutions, and we are able to achieve a 0.983 AUC score in real-world data. Numerical testing demonstrates that the XGBoost-LSTM stacking model has excellent performance, stability, and the ability of generalization. © 2020 Xiali Wang and Xiang Lu.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094901907

A key issue is that both real and decoy objects have observable features that may give the attacker the ability to distinguish one from the other. However, a defender deploying decoys may be able to modify some features of either the real or decoy objects (at some cost) making the decoys more effective. We present a game-theoretic model of two-sided deception that models this scenario. We present an empirical analysis of this model to show strategies for effectively concealing decoys, as well as some limitations of decoys for cybersecurity. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

However, malware is still one of the best methods to gain persistent access and control of a target system. Malware is often combined with a well socially-engineered phishing attack that deceives a user to gain a foothold on a system. Once the attakcer gains a beachhead in the victim's network, it may be used to download additional payloads and exploit vulnerabilities, to gain more control and access within a network. Using malware as their foothold, attackers are able to to conduct reconnaissance, gather intelligence (e.g., exfiltration of intellectual property) or simply inflict damage or extortion (e.g., ransomware). All of this has to be done in a way that allows an attacker to retain access for as long as possible; the ability to do so is called persistence, and this paper examines the different techniques used by malware to accomplish persistence in an ever evolving landscape. © 2020 The Authors.

Consequently, evaluating the quality of pilling up research reports is becoming increasingly challenging. Several approaches for evaluation of quality of the scientific outputs exist however they appear to be fairly time-consuming and/or adapted for other research designs. In this paper, we propose a reasonably light-weight structure-based approach for evaluating case study and action research reports (SAE-CSAR) based on eight key parts of a real-world research report: Research question, case description, data collection, data analysis, ethical considerations, results, discussion and limitations. To evaluate the feasibility of theproposed approach, we conducted a systematic literature survey of papers reporting on real-world cybersecurity research. A total of N = 102 research papers were evaluated. Results suggest that SAE-CSAR is useful and relatively efficient, and may offer a thought-provoking insight into the studied field. Although there is a positive trend for the inclusion of data collection, data analysis and research questions in papers, there is still room for improvement suggesting that the field of real-world cybersecurity research did not mature yet. The presence of a discussion in a paper appears to affect most its citation count. However, it seems that it is not uniformly accepted what a discussion should include.

It begins with two frameworks that are important in practice: the principlist framework employed in the Menlo Report on cybersecurity research and the rights-based principle that is influential in the law, in particular EU law. It is argued that since the harms and benefits caused by cybersecurity operations and policies are of a probabilistic nature, both approaches cannot avoid dealing with risk and probability. Therefore, the chapter turns to the ethics of risk, showing that it is a necessary complement to such approaches. The ethics of risk are discussed in more detail by considering two consequentialist approaches (utilitarianism and maximin consequentialism), deontological approaches and contractualist approaches to risk at length, highlighting the difficulties raised by special cases. Finally, Nissenbaum’s ‘contextual integrity’ approach is introduced, which has become an important framework for understanding privacy, both descriptively and normatively. A revised version of this framework is proposed for identifying and ethically assessing changes brought about by cybersecurity measures and policies, not only in relation to privacy but more generally to the key expectations concerning human interactions within the practice. © 2020, The Author(s).",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092181797

In order to defend from this attack, mitigation actions usually overprovision and sinkhole malicious traffic. Sooner the attack is detected, better is the mitigation. Hence, we advocate for using a prediction technique aiming to anticipate actions against the possible attack, before it effectively starts. Then, this article contributes to advance the state-of-the-art presenting a distributed architecture that identifies early signals of a possible DDoS attack and detects bots composing a botnet. The architecture identifies the malicious actors (bots) participating in the attack. The bot detection technique is triggered by the prediction of DDoS supported by early signals. Prediction identifies signals of attack on the network before it reaches advanced stages. Based on the metastability theory, it provides unsupervised statistical learning and identifies the imminence of DDoS attacks.

However, what is missing is a comprehensive, established framework for logistics and supply chain cybersecurity. The emerging area of cyber-supply chain security continues to lack suitable models to help secure critical data and systems. In all industries and fields today, cybersecurity is no longer just an information technology issue. It is a business sustainability and business strategy issue. The human factors in the cyber-supply chain operations represent the actions or events when human error results in a successful hack or data breach. Today, protecting logistics and supply chain organizations from cyber and data security risks is no longer just an information technology employee function. Every organizational employee has a responsibility in the data protection process. Progressive organizations are ones that can create methods, policies, and approaches that encourage employees to play an active role in the information and cybersecurity process. This paper explores innovative approaches around open-door systems as a proactive data security and cybersecurity risk reduction organizational strategy.

Cyberattacks targeting in-vehicle networks can result in a reasonable threat considering passenger safety. Unlike previous literature, the methodology focuses on a comparatively large sample of vehicle networks (114 objects) by proposing a new framework of statistical techniques for measuring, classifying, and modelling in-vehicle networks concerning the changed vulnerability, instead of dealing with each vehicle network individually. To facilitate understanding of the vulnerability patterns of in-vehicle networks, the dataset has been evaluated through three analytic stages: vulnerability identification, classification, and modeling. The result has helped in ranking vehicles based on their network vulnerability level. The result of the modeling has shown that every additional remote endpoint installation causes a relevant weakening in security. Higher cost vehicles have also appeared to be more vulnerable to cyberattacks, while the increase in the number of segmented network domains has had a positive effect on network security. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091169447

This allows achieving some obvious subsequent goals such as data-origin authentication, and the traceability and implicit non-repudiation of commands given to intelligent field and direct control equipment. The possibility to include digital signatures with a minimum impact on a standard and a reliable data communication protocol, such as Distributed Network Protocol version 3 (DNP3), also known to have a mature, industrially validated, open-source implementation, has been tested and the results are presented.

Services such as audio and video streaming, self-driving cars, the Internet of things (IoT), or instant communication on social networks have forced system designers to rethink the architectures and tools for implementing computer systems. Reactive programming has been advocated as a programming paradigm suitable for implementing dynamic applications with complex and heterogeneous architectural needs. However, there is no consensus on the core set of features that a reactive framework must-have. Furthermore, the current set of features proposed in reactive tools seems very restricted to cope with the actual needs for concurrency and distribution in modern systems. In this paper, several alternative semantics for distributed reactive languages are investigated, addressing complex open issues such as glitch avoidance, explicit distribution support, and constructs for explicit time management. First, we propose a reactive event-based programming language with explicit support for distribution, concurrency, and explicit time manipulation (ReactiveXD). Second, we present a reactive event-based semantic framework called Distributed Reactive Rewriting Framework (DRRF). The framework uses rewriting logic to model the components of a distributed base application, observables, and observers, and predicates supporting explicit time manipulation. Finally, to validate the proposal, the paper discusses the specification of the semantics of ReactiveXD and a scenario describing a case of intrusion detection on IoT networks. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090267684

The model is intended for the decision support system that is being developed for investors, in cases that require a choosing of rational strategies. As an apparatus for solving the problem, we use the tools of the theory of multi-step games with several terminal surfaces. Such an approach, in our opinion, allows us to find solutions to the problem under consideration. A feature of the approach proposed in the paper, and accordingly the model, was the assumption that the one side or a player-investor, does not have complete information about the actions of the opposite side. Such incomplete information may include, for example, the lack of data on the financial strategies of the investment counterparty, on the status of its financial resources, etc. It is shown that the proposed model can become the basis for the corresponding algorithmic and software implementation during the development of an intelligent decision support system for choosing rational investor strategies. During computational experiments, we have evaluated the possibility of applying the model to such complex investment objects as information technology and systems.

Moreover, IDPSs generate an overwhelming number of logs that are challenging to handle and analyze.

Hyperion interactively visualizes rules to help users understand how the IDPS rules are managed and applied to the enterprise's network entities. Hyperion also provides effective visualizations to enable users to visually analyze the type, period, traffic, and frequency of attacks in addition to a traditional count-based timeline visualization. Finally, Hyperion enables users to interactively simulate the effect of a change in parameters of a detection rule.

The emphasis on persistent engagement and collective deterrence and the likely hindrances to a negotiated agreement to end or reduce cyber-attack means that the United States is entering a new era of international cybersecurity policy, one that is more conflictive and that comes with greater risk of warfare. One result of the realization that no network can be guaranteed to resist persistent efforts by an advanced attacker is an increased emphasis on risk-management and on resilience in cybersecurity planning. The emphasis on risk management and resilience assumes that opponents will be able to gain access to networks and the goal should be to ensure continued provision of critical services in a degraded network environment.

It shows how securitization theory has evolved to become more applicable to cybersecurity. Everyday security practices are a specific grammar of the cybersecurity sector, in that securitizing actors mobilize individuals’ experiences of insecurity for both ensuring their partnership and compliance, but also to connect hypersecuritizing scenarios to their lived experiences. The link between information technology and national security was firmly established in military writings in the time after the Second World War and remained uncontested. The cybersecurity danger discourse is about a diverse set of threat forms: ranging from computer viruses and other malicious software to cybercrime activity to the categories of cyberterror and cyberwar.

While there are a variety of sophisticated system attacks, phishing emails continues to be successful in gaining users attention and leading to disastrous security consequences. In designing strategies to protect users from fraudulent phishing emails, system designers need to know which attack approaches and type of content seems to exploit human limitations and vulnerabilities. In this study, we are focusing on the attackers’ footprints (emails) and examining the phishing email content and characteristics utilizing publicly available phishing attack repository databases. We analyzed several variables to gain a better understanding of the techniques and language used in these emails to capture users’ attention. Our findings reveal that the words primarily used in these emails are targeting users’ emotional tendencies and triggers to apply their attacks. In addition, attackers employ user-targeted words and subjects that exploits certain emotional triggers such as fear and anticipation.

Thus, the automotive industry is shifting from mechanical devices to electronic control devices, and is not moving to Internet of Things devices connected to 5G networks. Owing to the convergence of automobile-information and communication technology (ICT), the safety and convenience features of automobiles have improved significantly. However, cyberattacks that occur in the existing ICT environment and can occur in the upcoming 5G network are being replicated in the automobile environment. In a hyper-connected society where 5G networks are commercially available, automotive security is extremely important, as vehicles become the center of vehicle to everything (V2X) communication connected to everything around them. Designing, developing, and deploying information security techniques for vehicles require a systematic security-risk-assessment and management process throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. To do this, a security risk analysis (SRA) must be performed, which requires an analysis of cyber threats on automotive vehicles. In this study, we introduce a cyber kill chain-based cyberattack analysis method to create a formal vulnerability-analysis system. We can also analyze car-hacking studies that were conducted on real cars to identify the characteristics of the attack stages of existing car-hacking techniques and propose the minimum but essential measures for defense.

Even with such advanced solutions these companies are not able to protect or attacks. In addition to attacks one of the key aspects is users behaviour and detecting anomalies when the users are utilizing the systems on the network as well the patterns in their behaviour. Lack of proper monitoring and controls implementation and data breaches are seen. The security professionals within the organizations as well as outside are grappling to solve these issues. One of the new approaches to information security is User Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA). One of the biggest challenges with incident response is the large amount of data that the system environment has generated and how to accommodate and analyse the data. Analytics within the area of information security is a new area. Analytics professionals are working on creating rules and correlation aspects, in addition to trends and behaviour patterns with respect to the users behaviour and their approach. One of the key focus areas of UEBA is on users actions and behaviours. Behaviours, users access as well as their usage anomalies are popular and interpretation of these anomalies or malicious activities is very critical. UEBA approach is a viable approach in the area of security to detect user behaviour anomalies using methods like statistical analysis and machine learning. The paper aims to show how analytics and specifically UEBA can help in users patterns and any anomalies within these patterns. With the focus on user behaviours and the analytics related to user behaviours the authors look at the insights, benefits and the utilization of resources in the area of security. The various parameters analysed for the users are user name, IP Address, time of usage, date of usage. The data was analysed over a period of 3 months.

Specifically, many types of current cyber attacks use URLs for attack communications (e.g., C&C, phishing, and spear-phishing). Despite the continuous progress in detecting these attacks, many alarming problems remain open, such as the weak spots of the defense mechanisms. Because ML has become one of the most prominent methods of malware detection, we propose a robust feature selection mechanism that results in malicious domain detection models that are resistant to black-box evasion attacks. This paper makes two main contributions. Our mechanism exhibits high performance based on data collected from ~5000 benign active URLs and ~1350 malicious active (attacks) URLs. We also provide an analysis of robust feature selection based on widely used features in the literature. Note that even though we cut the feature set dimensional space in half (from nine to four features), we still improve the performance of the classifier (an increase in the model’s F1-score from 92.92% to 95.81%). The fact that our models are robust to malicious perturbations but are also useful for clean data demonstrates the effectiveness of constructing a model that is solely trained on robust features. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087775961

The effectiveness of CSII in T2DM has not yet been convincingly demonstrated, despite some positive evidence. An overview and an assessment of various studies to date will be given. T2DM is a heterogeneous disease with a substantial phenotypic variability; therefore, it is difficult to provide general conclusions about the effectiveness of CSII in T2DM therapy. The pump types, characteristics, and associated barriers may play a relevant role for therapy outcome. Most advanced functions like various bolus dosages offered by conventional insulin pumps are not needed for T2DM treatment and complicate the device handling for this subject group. Additionally, new technologies like increased connectivity, advanced software features, and interoperability are currently becoming available representing further barriers. The implementation of this technological progress might be a benefit for pumps for T2DM as well.

The risk of being targeted by a damaging attack is increased when medical devices are used which rely on unmaintained legacy software that cannot be replaced and may have publicly known vulnerabilities. This review aims to provide insight into solutions presented in the literature that mitigate risks caused by legacy software on medical devices. We performed a scoping review by categorising and analysing the contributions of a selection of articles, taken from a literature set discovered through bidirectional citation searching. We found 18 solutions, each fitting at least one of the categories of intrusion detection and prevention, communication tunnelling or hardware protections. Approaches taken include proxying Bluetooth communication through smartphones, behaviour-specification based anomaly detection and authenticating signals based on physical characteristics. These solutions are applicable to various use-cases, ranging from securing pacemakers to medical sensor networks. Most of the solutions are based on intrusion detection and on tunnelling insecure wireless communications. These technologies have distinct application areas, and the decision which one is most appropriate will depend on the type of medical device. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084954533

WDs are often seen as an extension to mobile devices such as smartphones even thought the size, shape and physical specifications, i.e., the form factors are completely different. The core features of WDs are always accessible and available to users while sole input devices, e.g. keyboard does not exist. In this case, the traditional authentication methods in which users type in passwords on the system can not apply to authenticate WDs. Therefore, this paper introduces an Authentication Framework for Wearable Devices (AFWD) that basically includes an authentication model designed for WDs, capable of creating reliable and secure authentication techniques. Subjective and objective assessment of the AFWD showed that it provides usability, deployability, and security and that people are willing to use it if available.

Forensic tasks are solved by methods of comparing two samples from two random processes based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s agreement with the use of specialized software such as “Fractal”. For geolocation tasks of an electronic device, it is expedient to use individual template for an error vector in determining the deviations in the signal constellation. The tasks of detecting counterfeit notebooks and mobile phones are solved by methods of comparing the spectra of their own electromagnetic radiation of these devices with the standard.

Therefore, a failure of data security may yield severe penalties and class-action lawsuits, which can significantly increase the expenses than before.

There are very few studies that quantify the monetary value of data breaches, which are based on the number of affected people or the number of stolen records. This study proposes a new methodology to quantify the monetary value of the data breaches by categorizing information as personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII).

We find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium probabilities and corresponding Bayesian belief updates. We simulate the game to find the best response strategies with which regular and malicious organizations can play to increase their payoffs.

The applied method was root cause analysis combined with a socio-technical analysis to provide insight into the complexity of the problem and to propose solutions. The study used an online questionnaire targeting respondents who had their accounts compromised (N=72) to determine the probable root causes. Furthermore, the socio-technical approach consisted of the Security by Consensus model to analyze how causes interact in the system layers. We constructed a scoring scheme to help determine the plausible root causes of compromise, and here we identified password re-use across multiple sites (41.7%) as the most probable cause of individual compromise, followed by weak passwords (25.0%), malware infections (19.4%) and phishing (9.7%).

Traditional threat analysis methods use design models alongside threat models as an input for security analysis, hence missing the life-cycle-based dynamicity required by the security concern. In this paper, we argue for an attacker-aware systems modeling language that exposes the systems attack surfaces.

The relationship between the management of what a new company does to protect against the malicious or unauthorized use of electronic data, and the management of what a new company does to scale company value rapidly is important, but not well understood. We use a topic modelling technique to identify the eight topics that best describe a corpus comprised of 137 assertions about what new companies do to scale company value rapidly, manually examine the stability of the topics extracted from the dataset, and describe the relationship between 17 assertions about how to manage cybersecurity in new companies, and the six topics found to be stable.

We find that of the 17 cybersecurity assertions, seven are related to Position, two to Innovate, one to Fundraise and, one to Complement.

However, one of the biggest barriers for massive cloud adoption is the growing cybersecurity threats/risks that influence its confidence and feasibility. Existing threat models for clouds may not be able to capture complex attacks. For example, an attacker may combine multiple security vulnerabilities into an intelligent, persistent, and sequence of attack behaviors that will continuously act to compromise the target on clouds. Hence, new models for detection of complex and diversified network attacks are needed. In this article, we introduce an effective threat modeling approach that has the ability to predict and detect the probability of occurrence of various security threats and attacks within the cloud environment using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM is a powerful statistical analysis technique and is used to create a probability matrix based on the sensitivity of the data and possible system components that can be attacked. In addition, the HMM is used to provide supplemental information to discover a trend attack pattern from the implicit (or hidden) raw data. The proposed model is trained to identify anomalous sequences or threats so that accurate and up-to-date information on risk exposure of cloud-hosted services are properly detected.

In 2019, the Internet user audience in Russia amounted to 90 million people (75.4% of the country’s adult population). More than 50% of the European population (250 million people) and 40% of the Chinese population (approximately 560 million people) use digital banking in everyday life. Therefore, the protection of the rights of consumers of digital financial services are facing governments of all countries of the world. Design/methodology/approach: In this chapter, the authors studied and analyzed the provisions of legislation, judicial practice, the doctrines of the European Union, the USA, China, and the Russian Federation. Findings: It is shown that the legal regulation of consumer protection of digital financial services should not be too strict and excessive. Excessive regulation causes digital financial service providers to travel to other countries where regulation is milder or absent altogether, which happened in the United States in 2018. The government had to cancel some very tough provisions of Dodd-Frank 2010. On the other hand, the comparatively lenient regulation of the distribution of digital banking services, for example in China, has led to the emergence of a number of fraudulent schemes in the field of Internet banking. Under pressure from the indignant public, the Chinese government had to take urgent measures to rectify the situation Originality/value: The novelty lies in the analysis of a number of regulatory acts, including: acts of the European Union (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data; Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on EU-wide payment services (PSD2)); the USA (Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010); Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (2018) (EGRRCPA)); China (General Rules of the Civil Law of China; Law of Consumer Rights and Interests; Cybersecurity Law 2017) and the Russian Federation (Law “On Protection of Consumer Rights” of 07.02.1992 (as amended on March 18, 2019)). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081660339

In order to guard users from fraudulent information and minimize the loss caused by visiting phishing websites, a variety of methods have been developed to filter out phishing websites. At present, there are several phishing detection methods continually being updated, but the experimental results of them are not enough satisfactory. To fill these gaps, an improved model based on attention mechanism bi-directional gated recurrent unit, named BiGRU-Attention model, will be introduced. The basic mechanism of this model is that it obtains the characters before and after a particular character through the BiGRU, and then calculates score for that character by the Attention. Since the final score depends on the composition of the input, the more similar between phishing and legitimate websites, the more difficult it is to be distinguished. By utilizing this model, most of the phishing URLs will be tested out. Also, an explanation of why phishing and legal websites can be distinguished will be given. Based on the experimental results, the BiGRU-Attention model achieves an accuracy of 99.55%, and the F1-score is 99.54%.

Delivering antivirus program to networks is an important task of a cybersecurity company. As the bandwidth resource in a company is limited and precious, cybersecurity companies have to make a tradeoff between the impact(i.e. the economic loss) of malicious codes and the bandwidth assigned to transmit the antivirus programs. This paper addresses the malicious code and bandwidth tradeoff(MCBT) problem. By developing a novel malicious code and antivirus program interacting model, the total loss, which is the sum of the bandwidth usage fee and the economic loss, is quantified. On this basis, the MCBT problem is modelled as a constrained optimization problem that we refer to as the MCBT model, where the independent variable stands for bandwidth, and the objective function stands for the total loss. Some optimal bandwidth is determined by solving the MCBT model. Based on this, we propose a heuristic algorithm named DOWNHILL, which outperforms random strategies. Finally, the influence of some factors on the optimal bandwidth and the corresponding optimal total loss is uncovered through numerical simulations. To our knowledge, this is the first time the MCBT problem is treated in this way. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079739210

For the risk identification stage, we propose a multidimensional hierarchical index system for assessing cybersecurity risk; the system's security status is determined in three dimensions, i.e., basic operation, vulnerabilities, and threats, and these dimensions guide the data collection. In the risk calculation stage, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to assess the network security risk. We provide a new definition of the quality of alert and optimize the observation sequence of the HMM. The model uses a learning algorithm instead of setting the parameters manually. We introduce the concept of network node association to increase the reliability and accuracy of the risk assessment. The simulation results show that the proposed index system provides quantitative data that reflect the security status of the network.

While all biotechnology stakeholders and ecosystems are valuable assets to the bioeconomy, genetic information systems are particularly vulnerable with great potential for harm and misuse. The security of post-analysis phases of data dissemination and storage have been focused on by others, but the security of wet and dry laboratories is also challenging due to distributed devices and systems that are not designed nor implemented with security in mind. Consequently, industry standards and best operational practices threaten the security of genetic information systems.

However, with repeated exposures to system messages and computer security warnings, neural and behavioral responses show evidence of habituation. Habituation has been demonstrated at a neural level as repetition suppression where responses are attenuated with subsequent repetitions. In the brain, repetition suppression to visual stimuli has been demonstrated in multiple cortical areas, including the occipital lobe and medial temporal lobe. Prior research into the repetition suppression effect has generally focused on a single repetition and has not examined the pattern of signal suppression with repeated exposures. We used complex, everyday stimuli, in the form of images of computer programs or security warning messages, to examine the repetition suppression effect across repeated exposures. The use of computer warnings as stimuli also allowed us to examine the activation of learned fearful stimuli. We observed widespread linear decreases in activation with repeated exposures, suggesting that repetition suppression continues after the first repetition. Further, we found greater activation for warning messages compared to neutral images in the anterior insula, pre-supplemental motor area, and inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting differential processing of security warning messages. However, the repetition suppression effect was similar in these regions for both warning messages and neutral images. Additionally, we observed an increase of activation in the default mode network with repeated exposures, suggestive of increased mind wandering with continuing habituation. © Copyright © 2020 Kirwan, Bjornn, Anderson, Vance, Eargle and Jenkins.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098084178

With the emergence of machine learning and especially deep learning, many malware detection models (malware classifiers) have been developed to learn features of malware samples collected from static or dynamic analysis. However, these classifiers experience a deterioration in performance (e.g., detection accuracy) over time due to the changes in the distribution of malware samples. Leveraging the positive aspects of adversarial samples, we aim at enhancing the robustness of malware classifiers using synthetically-adversarial samples. We develop Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that learn to generate not only malicious samples but also benign samples to enrich the training set of a baseline malware classifier. We improve the performance of the developed GANs by incorporating a relativistic discriminator and the cosine margin loss function such that quasi-realistic samples can be generated. We carry out extensive experiments with publicly available malware samples to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that without synthetic samples in the training set, the baseline classifier experiences a drop in its detection accuracy by up to 18.20% when evaluated against a test set that includes synthetic samples. By introducing synthetic samples into the training set and retraining the classifier, the improvement in detection accuracy not only compensates the drop but also increases further by up to 4.15%. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100416559

In addition, security experts recommend using cybersecurity standards which consist of a collection of best practices to protect organizations from cyber threats. However, many organizations, companies and governments lack experienced personnel in the cybersecurity domain, so they have difficulty adopting a standard approach or cybersecurity framework. Protecting organizations from cyber threats while demonstrating compliance with laws and standards is seen as extremely complex due to the difficulty on choosing the appropriate standard to be used. Moreover, lack of knowledge on the elements needed that offered by the standard is lead to the problem on identifying the started point where the protection will be began. Therefore, in this paper, a literature and the analysis is presented in identifying the elements of cybersecurity standard and framework that can be facilitate the organization or government on choosing the appropriate standard and framework to be used and utilized. The literature review was carried out to understand the various types of cybersecurity standards and frameworks and the analysis is conducted to identify the elements in each of them. In this paper, eight steps are presented and include the types of international standards, which are general, local regulation, as well as specific standards used in the industrial sector, to conclude the findings of the analysis.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate if banks are disclosing information on their operational resilience risk. The study initially reviews the regulatory landscape for operational resiliency. The recent annual reports of the GSIB banks are reviewed to identify if they have made references to operational resilience. Through text mining, a frequency analysis of terms related to operational resilience was done, followed by an evaluation to understand the existence of relationships between these terms. The study shows that the regulatory guidance for operational resilience is still evolving with much of the current impetus on cybersecurity. There is a notable gap between banks that have reported on operational resiliency and those that have not, with a few patterns visible. Research in the area of operational resilience is relatively new and limited, and this research for the first time analyses the disclosures related to operational resilience in annual reports. Further, for policymakers, it highlights the disparity in disclosures around this relatively new area of risk, thus calling for additional regulatory guidance. © 2020 by the author.

Existing research-based cyber threat intelligence systems and production systems often utilize keyword filtering as a method to obtain training data for a classification model or as a classifier in itself. This method is known to have concerns with false-positives that affect data quality and thus can produce downstream issues for security analysts that utilize these types of systems. We propose a method to classify open-source intelligence data into a cybersecurity-related information stream and subsequently increase the quality of that stream using an unsupervised clustering method. Our method expands on keyword filtering techniques by introducing a word2vec generated associated words list which assists in the classification of ambiguous posts to reduce false-positives while still retrieving large scope data. We then use k-means clustering on positively classified entries to identify and remove clusters that are not relevant to threats. We further explore this method by investigating the effects of using segmentation based on data characteristics to achieve better classification. Together these methods are able to create a higher quality cyber threat-related data stream that can be applied to existing text-based threat intelligence systems that use keyword filtering methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095860756

Against this background, we investigated e-banking fraud and the role trust governance plays in both the adoption and refusal to migrate and use electronic banking in Nigeria. Using qualitative methods (in-depth and key informant interviews) of data collection, 30 participants were purposively selected and in some instances reached through the snowball and referral methods.

We take a different approach to understand insiders’ ISP compliance by exploring how insiders view their rights and responsibilities related to security-relevant behaviors. Relying on Deonance Theory, we assess the extent to which insiders categorize a wide variety of behaviors that are or can be implemented in corporate ISPs according to several deontic conditional operators (e.g., nature of perceived requiredness). These operators form the basis for a rights and responsibility framework. We find that out of 38 unique security-relevant behaviors, 22 exhibit one or more forms of potential moral “gray area” patterns. Among these patterns, significant differences between insiders’ descriptive (i.e., “is”) and normative (i.e., “should be”) assessments of rights and responsibilities perceptions are particularly interesting. Our findings shed additional light on insiders’ compliance with organizational ISPs when those ISPs place increased restrictions on what the insider must or must not do. © 2020",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091633437

Furthermore, a strict resource constraint is introduced to limit the frequency of the attacks/defenses for both players. We characterize the best responses for both attacker and defender under both nonadaptive and adaptive strategies.

In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number and variety of malwares, which amplifies the need to improve automatic detection and classification of the malwares. Nowadays, neural network methodology has reached a level that may exceed the limits of previous machine learning methods, such as Hidden Markov Models and Support Vector Machines (SVM). As a result, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown superior performance compared to traditional learning techniques, specifically in tasks such as image classification. Motivated by this success, we propose a CNN-based architecture for malware classification. The malicious binary files are represented as grayscale images and a deep neural network is trained by freezing the pre-trained VGG16 layers on the ImageNet dataset and adapting the last fully connected layer to the malware family classification. Our evaluation results show that our approach is able to achieve an average of 98% accuracy for the MALIMG dataset. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

One of the most popular ways to achieve this result is Tor. The anonymity and untraceability that Tor provides, however, can also be used by ill-intentioned users who try to take advantage of bypassing security control and policies. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) mentions two methods of recognizing Tor traffic in the enterprise: indicator- or behavior-based analysis. The first one uses log analysis and lists of Tor exit nodes to identify the suspicious activity while the latter inspects patterns in TCP and UDP ports, DNS queries and inspecting the payload of the packets. In this paper, we propose a different approach using white-box machine learning models such as decision trees and Random Forest. On the one hand, our classifier achieves accuracy levels above 95%. On the other hand, our approach is the first one to allow understanding the importance of each traffic feature in the classification. Our results demonstrate that the TCP window size, the frame size and time related traffic features can be used to identify Tor traffic. In this paper we will describe a Machine Learning methodology used to identify Tor network traffic utilizing decision trees C5.0 and Random Forest.

Hence, an alternative solution is an urgent requirement as the existing detection models are not sufficient to spot emerging ransomware treat. With this motivation, our work proposes ""DeepGuard, ""a novel concept of modeling user behavior for ransomware detection. The main idea is to log the file-interaction pattern of typical user activity and pass it through deep generative autoencoder architecture to recreate the input. With sufficient training data, the model can learn how to reconstruct typical user activity (or input) with minimal reconstruction error. Hence, by applying the three-sigma limit rule on the model's output, DeepGuard can distinguish the ransomware activity from the user activity. The experiment result shows that DeepGuard effectively detects a variant class of ransomware with minimal false-positive rates. Overall, modeling the attack detection with user-behavior permits the proposed strategy to have deep visibility of various ransomware families. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098987972

This problem is exacerbated by enterprise server applications, which expose tremendous amounts of information about their security postures, greatly expediting attackers' reconnaissance incursions (e.g., knowledge gathering attacks). Unfortunately, current patching processes offer no insights into attacker activities, and prompt attack remediation is hindered by patch compatibility considerations and deployment cycles. To reverse this asymmetry, a patch management model is proposed to facilitate the rapid injection of software patches into live, commodity applications without disruption of production workflows, and the transparent sandboxing of suspicious processes for counterreconnaissance and threat information gathering. Our techniques improve workload visibility and vulnerability management, and overcome perennial shortcomings of traditional patching methodologies, such as proneness to attacker fingerprinting, and the high cost of deployment. The approach enables a large variety of novel defense scenarios, including rapid security patch testing with prompt recovery from defective patches and the placement of exploit sensors inlined into production workloads. An implementation for six enterprise-grade server programs demonstrates that our approach is practical and incurs minimal runtime overheads.

Domain names or links that are visually similar to actual ones are created via punycode to obfuscate the attack, making the victim more susceptible to phishing. For example, victims may mistake 'linkedin.com' for 'linkedin.com' and in the process, divulge personal details to the fake website. Current State of The Art (SOTA) typically make use of string comparison algorithms (e.g. Levenshtein Distance), which are computationally heavy. One reason for this is the lack of publicly available datasets, hindering the training of more advanced Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, no one font is able to render all types of punycode correctly, posing a significant challenge to the creation of a dataset that is unbiased toward any particular font. This coupled with the vast number of internet domains pose a challenge in creating a dataset that can capture all possible variations. Here, we show how a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), PhishGAN, can be used to generate images of hieroglyphs, conditioned on non-homoglyph input text images. Practical changes to current SOTA were required to facilitate the generation of more varied homoglyph text-based images. We also demonstrate a workflow of how PhishGAN together with a Homoglyph Identifier (HI) model can be used to identify the domain the homoglyph was trying to imitate.

Several promising Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) offering high-density, high speed, and competitive reliability/endurance while eliminating leakage issues are being investigated. On one hand, the above-desired properties make emerging NVM suitable candidates to assist or replace conventional memories in memory hierarchy as well as to infuse compute capability to eliminate Von-Neumann bottleneck. On the other hand, their unique features such as high and asymmetric read/write current and persistence bring new threats to data security while compute-capability imposes new fundamentally different security challenges. Some of these memories are already deployed in full systems and as discrete chips. Therefore, it is utmost important to investigate the security issues of NVMs spanning the application space. This work makes pioneering contributions to this challenge through a holistic approach-from devices to circuits and systems using a combination of design and test methodologies to develop secure and resilient NVMs. The proposed attacks and countermeasures are validated on test boards using commercial NVM chips. Finally, this research has been tied to education by converting the test boards to design a modular and reproducible self-learning cybersecurity kit which has been piloted to train graduate and undergraduate students and K-12 teachers. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100160511

Nowadays, the quality of VR hardware and software provide the possibility to replace physical analysis in industry. In the automotive business, it has been used in product development by engineers and designers in the last years and further applications are being explored. Research has shown that VR application may reduce development cost and improve timing to market for new vehicles. This study aims to identify opportunities and limitations to apply VR in automotive product development marketing research. Based on a systematic review of the literature related to VR application on automotive business and in marketing research the results indicated that there are opportunities for this application such as cost reduction, proximity to customers, flexibility in interactions, model transportations avoidance, model complexity analysis, as well as limitations such as depth and haptic perception, motion tracking, lack of physical collision, color and texture definition, sound feedback, lack of product interaction and manipulation, visual spatial, graphic quality, gesture recognition, intuitiveness, customer aging, cybersecurity and cybersickness. On this basis, it is identified that VR in automotive product development marketing research may be used but considerations such as hardware and software definition, stimulus quality, research objectives, Mixed Reality applicability among others, must be taken in account. Further research is needed to identify other factors that could strengthen the effectiveness of this application in the sector. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099571895

With the support of the US Navy, we leveraged the national cyber range-a large, air-gapped cyber testbed equipped with state-of-the-art network and user emulation capabilities-to study six US Naval SOC analysts' usage of two tools. Our analysis identified several serious usability issues, including multiple violations of established usability heuristics for user interface design. We also discovered that analysts lacked a clear mental model of how these tools generate scores, resulting in mistrust a and/or misuse of the tools themselves. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between analysts' level of education or years of experience and their performance with either tool, suggesting that other factors such as prior background knowledge or personality play a significant role in ML-based tool usage. Our findings demonstrate that ML-based security tool vendors must put a renewed focus on working with analysts, both experienced and inexperienced, to ensure that their systems are usable and useful in real-world security operations settings. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099478414

The advanced operational and information technology devices used in MRE systems create a pathway for a cyber threat actor to gain unauthorized ac-cess to data or disrupt operation. To improve the resiliency of MRE systems as a predictable, affordable, and reliable source of energy from oceans and rivers, guidance was developed for an end users’ organization that describes a framework for identifying and managing cybersecurity risk. The development of the cyber-security guidance is based on standards described in the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity Framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This paper is the first of a two-part series that describes an approach to determine the cybersecurity risk for MRE systems based on assessing potential cyber threats, identifying vulnerabilities (people, processes, and technology, including physical and operational environment), and evaluating the consequences a cyberattack would have on operation of the MRE system and impact on end users’ mission and business objectives. MRE developers and stakeholders can use this approach to assess their current cybersecurity risk posture to incorporate appropri-ate cybersecurity controls to reduce the consequences and impacts from a cyber-attack on MRE systems. This approach can be refined further as MRE systems are deployed and operational configurations are available. © 2020, Marine Technology Society Inc..

And Womabat Security Technologies conducted a survey revealed that ransomware is an unknown concept to nearly two-thirds of employees. In practical, almost 95% of cybersecurity attacks are due to human error. At fact, expensive and sophisticated systems cannot work effectively without considering the human factor, while human factor is the major vulnerability in cybersecurity. Thus, it has great significance to give people cybersecurity awareness training. In this paper, we present a system, named ASURA, providing adaptive training aimed at improving cybersecurity awareness of people. Three issues can’t be neglected in adaptive cybersecurity awareness training, as follows. Firstly, we need to decide the proper training contents from the huge training materials. Secondly, the training contents should be timely updated, as cyber attacks constantly changing. At last, we should conduct training through effective and acceptable approach. We solved above three issues in this paper, and the innovative idea of this paper is constructing hierarchical concept map from the LOD database DBpedia. Then, we employ a series of processing on hierarchical concept map, including PageRank algorithm used to calculate the importance of each concept node, and filtering used to filtered out undefined and unrelated concepts. In particular, we get training contents from DBpedia dynamically and timely updated, so that training contents is keeping up to date. ASURA delivered training contents completely online, thus significant trimmed budget and allowed learners accessing training outside of a traditional classroom. Moreover, ASURA provide adaptive training targeted to individual learner, as it generate training contents based on the keyword from the learner. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085328927

However, most of these models stem from statistics, which cannot adapt to our application scenario very well.

To cope with this problem, semi-supervised learning can be employed that exploits a few labeled data and a lot of unlabeled data for learning.

By centering our discourse on instability and contradictions, we demonstrate the relevance of deconstruction in cybersecurity through four concrete examples drawn from four different areas: digital rights management, cyberwar, software vulnerability, and user authentication. We further address the concept of ontological security to draw the boundaries between beneficial and detrimental uses of deconstruction.

Challenges included in the condition before the contractual are organization eligibility and insurance contract design. The difficulties faced if the contractual exists, namely self-reporting, external security audit, and the insurer's refusal to pay the claim. Finally, no contractual agreement leads to a general challenge in cyber insurers, namely cyber insurance awareness and cost-benefit aspects of cybersecurity investment.

Thereby, the analysis of cybersecurity vulnerabilities is a mandatory task, but the number of vulnerabilities and system configurations that can be threatened is extremely high.

We propose a solution, entitled AMADEUS, to enable and support the automatic analysis and testing of cybersecurity vulnerabilities of configuration systems based on feature models. AMADEUS is a holistic solution that is able to automate the analysis of the specific infrastructures in the organisations, the existing vulnerabilities, and the possible configurations extracted from the vulnerability repositories. By using this information, AMADEUS generates automatically the feature models, that are used for reasoning capabilities to extract knowledge, such as to determine attack vectors with certain features. AMADEUS has been validated by demonstrating the capacities of feature models to support the threat scenario, in which a wide variety of vulnerabilities extracted from a real repository are involved.

This paper presents an attack-resilient system (ARS) for the WAPAC cybersecurity by seamlessly integrating the network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with intrusion mitigation and prevention system (IMPS). In particular, the proposed NIDS utilizes signature and behavior-based rules to detect attack reconnaissance, communication failure, and data integrity attacks.

Due to the tremendous success of deep learning (DL) algorithms in various domains including image recognition and computer vision, researchers started adopting these techniques for solving MTS data mining problems, many of which are targeted for safety-critical and cost-critical applications. Unfortunately, DL algorithms are known for their susceptibility to adversarial examples which makes the DL regression models for MTS forecasting also vulnerable to those attacks. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has explored the vulnerability of DL MTS regression models to adversarial time series examples, which is an important step, specifically when the forecasting from such models is used in safety-critical and cost-critical applications. In this work, we leverage existing adversarial attack generation techniques from the image classification domain and craft adversarial multivariate time series examples for three state-of-the-art deep learning regression models, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We evaluate our study using Google stock and household power consumption dataset.

Such exfiltrations cause breach events that can lead to millions of dollars of loss. Perimeter defense is not enough by itself since successful exploits from insiders can also be very damaging. Internal network user activities need to be monitored to detect malicious actions. Automatic machine learning methods can be applied for network anomaly detection, but they create a lot of false alarms. Domain experts can identify malicious users, but they are unable to process large volumes of data. Interactive machine learning (iML) deals with this tradeoff by creating an efficient collaboration between domain experts and machine learning algorithms. Previous research in iML has focused mainly on collaboration with non-experts. The design and requirements for expertise-driven iML have yet to be delineated for cybersecurity applications. In this research, we proposed an Active Learning (AL) model trained with outputs from a liberal (outputting many false alarms as well as possible hits) anomaly detection (AD) criterion to study expert-iML collaboration in anomaly detection. The results showed that: iML in this context can prune false alarms and minimize misses; the performance/compatibility tradeoff that typically occurs in conventional machine learning updates may be less salient in iML.

At the same time, privacy and compliance regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU ePrivacy regulation, and the upcoming EU Cybersecurity Act raise the bar for secure processing and traceability of critical data. Especially the demand to provide information about existing data records of an individual and the ability to delete them on demand is central in privacy regulations. Common to these requirements is that cloud providers must be able to track data as it flows across the different services to ensure that it never moves outside of the legitimate realm, and it is known at all times where a specific copy of a record that belongs to a specific individual or business process is located. However, current cloud architectures do neither provide the means to holistically track data flows across different services nor to enforce policies on data flows. In this paper, we point out the deficits in the data flow tracking functionalities of major cloud providers by means of a set of practical experiments. We then generalize from these experiments introducing a generic architecture that aims at solving the problem of cloud-wide data flow tracking and show how it can be built in a Kubernetes-based prototype implementation. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099337250

They typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic regimes, are characterized by complex and variable hydrology, and span multiple jurisdictions with diverse water demands and values. They are often data-poor and in many developing economies are characterized by weak water governance. Rapid global change is seeing significant changes to the pressures on the water resources of large basins, exacerbating the challenge of sustainable water management. Diverse technologies have long supported water resource planning and development, from data collection, analytics, simulation, to decision-making, and real-time operations. In the last two decades however, a rapid increase in the range, capability, and accessibility of new technologies, coupled with large reductions in cost, mean there are increasing opportunities for emerging technologies to significantly “disrupt” traditional approaches to water resources management. In this paper, we consider the application of ‘disruptive technologies’ in water resources management in large river basins, through a lens of improving water security. We discuss the role of different actors and institutions for water management considering a range of emerging disruptive technologies. We consider the risks and benefits associated with the use of these technologies and discuss the barriers to their widespread adoption. We obverse a positive trend away from the reliance solely on centralized government institutions and traditional modeling for the collection and analysis of data, towards a more open and dynamic ‘data and knowledge ecosystem’ that draws upon data services at different levels (global to local) to support water planning and operations. We expect that technological advances and cost reductions will accelerate, fueling increased incremental adoption of new technologies in water resources planning and management. Large-basin analytics could become virtually free for users with global, regional, and national development agencies absorbing the costs of development and any subscription services for end users (e.g., irrigators) to help improve water management at user level and improve economic productivity. Collectively, these changes can help to ‘democratize’ water management through improved access to data and information. However, disruptive technologies can also be deployed in top-down or centralized processes, and so their use is sometimes contested or misunderstood. Increased attention therefore needs to be given to ensuring equity in technology access, and to strengthening the governance context for technology deployment. Widespread adoption of disruptive technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals are trained, increased adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations, and careful consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues. © 2020 by the authors.

Existing cybersecurity frameworks are complex and implementation oriented. The framework can be systematically used to assess the strategic orientation of a firm with respect to its cybersecurity posture. The goal is to assist top-management-team with tailoring their decision-making about security investments while managing cyber risk at their organization. Design/methodology/approach: A thematic analysis of existing publications using content analysis techniques generates the initial set of keywords of significance. Additional factor analysis using the keywords provides us with a framework comprising of five pillars comprising prioritize, resource, implement, standardize and monitor (PRISM) for assessing a firm’s strategic cybersecurity orientation. Findings: The primary contribution is the development of a novel PRISM framework, which enables cyber decision-makers to identify and operationalize a tailored approach to address risk management and cybersecurity problems. PRISM framework evaluation will help organizations identify and implement the most tailored risk management and cybersecurity approach applicable to their problem(s). Originality/value: The new norm is for companies to realize that data stratification in cyberspace extends throughout their organizations, intertwining their need for cybersecurity within business operations.

OpenC2 provides the means to introduce standardized interfaces to cyber defense systems, enabling interoperability and allowing seamless integration, communication, and operation between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions. The suit of specifications includes a semantic language that enables machine-to-machine communication for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, actuator profiles that specify the subset of the OpenC2 language and may extend it in the context of specific cyber defense functions, and transfer specifications that utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in particular environments. Fundamentally, OpenC2 addresses the acting part of the Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework and is designed to be technology agnostic, concise, abstract, and extensible. Ultimately, OpenC2 is a building block for enabling coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time, shifting traditional monolithic cyber response approaches to more granular, flexible, and adaptive. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089440941

ICES is an independent not-for-profit research institute in the province of Ontario, Canada. This article was co-written by ICES' public engagement team and four members of the ICES Public Advisory Council (PAC). As part of the process of writing this article PAC members provided their reflections on why they got involved, what worked well and the limitations and challenges of ICES' approach. ICES described the development of its public engagement strategy to inform how the institution would capture and incorporate the values of Ontarians in ICES activities and research. ICES provided details on two key elements of its strategy: the formation of a PAC to advise its leadership, and the creation of resources and supports to encourage researchers to incorporate public engagement in their projects. PAC members and ICES provided perspectives on what impact they perceive as a result of the public engagement strategy. PAC members expressed that ICES has demonstrated listening to and using their input, but it is too early to evaluate if their feedback has changed the way ICES conducts its work. ICES discussed the challenges and successes in building and implementing the public engagement strategy, including recruiting a diverse council, aligning with public priorities and creating a culture of engagement. As a result of public input, ICES has restructured the way the institution explains its privacy and cybersecurity approach to build trust and confidence. ICES has also seen an increase in researchers using public engagement resources, and early data suggests that in 2019 about 20% of scientists included some form of public engagement in their projects. ICES' journey to public engagement resulted in important changes to processes and activities at the institution, but there is much more that needs to be done. PAC members advocate that public members should be engaged in health data research and hope that public input will be a core element in health data research in the future. ICES will continue its efforts to address public priorities and will seek to further evaluate the impact of public engagement across the organisation. September 2020 © The Authors.

In this paper, we present a novel anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS), called ARIES (smArt gRid Intrusion dEtection System), which is capable of protecting efficiently SG communications. ARIES combines three detection layers that are devoted to recognising possible cyberattacks and anomalies against (a) network flows, (b) Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets and (c) operational data. Each detection layer relies on a Machine Learning (ML) model trained using data originating from a power plant. In particular, the first layer (network flow-based detection) performs a supervised multiclass classification, recognising Denial of Service (DoS), brute force attacks, port scanning attacks and bots. The second layer (packet-based detection) detects possible anomalies related to the Modbus packets, while the third layer (operational data based detection) monitors and identifies anomalies upon operational data (i.e., time series electricity measurements). By emphasising on the third layer, the ARIES Generative Adversarial Network (ARIES GAN) with novel error minimisation functions was developed, considering mainly the reconstruction difference.

Geospatial data and medical data are examples of big data that require seamless integration with computational algorithms as outlined in Industry 4.0 towards adoption of fourth industrial revolution. Healthcare Industry 4.0 is an application of the design principles of Industry 4.0 to the medical domain. Mobile applications are now widely used to accomplish important business functions in almost all industries. These mobile devices, however, are resource poor and proved insufficient for many important medical applications. Resource rich cloud services are used to augment poor mobile device resources for data and compute intensive applications in the mobile cloud computing paradigm. However, the performance of cloud services is undesirable for data-intensive, latency-sensitive mobile applications due increased hop count between the mobile device and the cloud server. Cloudlets are virtual machines hosted in server placed nearby the mobile device and offer an attractive alternative to the mobile cloud computing in the form of mobile edge computing. This paper outlines cybersecurity and data privacy aspects for communications of measured patient data from wearable wireless biosensors to nearby cloudlet host server in order to facilitate the cloudlet based preliminary and essential complex analytics for the medical big data. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098466499

Experimental testbeds capable of providing flexible, scalable and interoperable platform for executing various cybersecurity experiments is highly in need by all stakeholders. A container-based SCADA testbed is presented in this work as a potential platform for executing cybersecurity experiments. Through this testbed, a network traffic containing ARP spoofing is generated that represents a Man in the middle (MITM) attack. While doing so, scanning of different systems within the network is performed which represents a reconnaissance attack. The network traffic generated by both ARP spoofing and network scanning are captured and further used for preparing a dataset. The dataset is utilized for training a network classification model through a machine learning algorithm.

The overall impact of information sharing on firms' cybersecurity investment decision has only been game-theoretically explored, not giving practical implication. The authors therefore leverage the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA) to observe firms' attitudinal changes toward investing in cybersecurity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors design a quasi-experiment where they set US cybersecurity firms as an experimental group (a proxy for total investment in cybersecurity) and nonsecurity firms as a control group to measure the net effect of CISA on overall cybersecurity investment. To enhance the robustness of the authors’ difference-in-difference estimation, the authors employed propensity score matched sample test and reduced sample test as well. Findings: For the full sample, the authors’ empirical findings suggest that US security firms' overall performance (i.e. Tobin's Q) improved following the legislation, which indicates that more investment in cybersecurity was followed by the formation of information sharing environment. Interestingly, big cybersecurity firms are beneficiaries of the CISA when the full samples are divided into small and large group. Both Tobin's Q and sales growth rate increased for big firms after CISA. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ findings shed more light on the research stream of cybersecurity and information sharing, a research area only explored by game-theoretical approaches. Given that the US government has tried to enforce cybersecurity defensive measures by building cooperative architecture such as CISA 2015, the policy implication of this study is far-reaching. Originality/value: The authors’ study contributes to the research on the economic benefits of sharing cybersecurity information by finding the missing link (i.e. empirical evidence) between “sharing” and “economic impact.” This paper confirms that CISA affects the cybersecurity industry unevenly by firm size, a previously unidentified relationship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089398915

It can lead to the destruction of the organisation’s internal network system and information leakage, which seriously threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. To make matters worse, since the attacker has authorized access to the internal network, they can launch the attack from the inside and erase their attack trace, which makes it challenging to track and forensics. A blockchain traceability system for insider threats is proposed in this paper to mitigate the issue. First, this paper constructs an insider threat model of the internal network from a different perspective: insider attack forensics and prevent insider attacker from escaping. Then, we analyze why it is difficult to track attackers and obtain evidence when an insider threat has occurred. After that, the blockchain traceability system is designed in terms of data structure, transaction structure, block structure, consensus algorithm, data storage algorithm, and query algorithm, while using differential privacy to protect user privacy. We deployed this blockchain traceability system and conducted experiments, and the results show that it can achieve the goal of mitigating insider threats. © 2020 by the authors.

Today, they pursue us everywhere: in technical, social, socio-technical, and even control systems, dramatically deteriorating their performance. In this variety, it is the computer systems that are sure to cause the growing anxiety in our digital era. Although for our everyday Internet surfing, experiencing long-lasting and annoying delays is an unpleasant but not dangerous situation, for industrial control systems, especially those dealing with critical infrastructures, such behavior is unacceptable. The article presents a deterministic approach to solving some digital control system problems associated with delays and backlogs. Being based on Network calculus, in contrast to statistical methods of Queuing theory, it provides worst-case results, which are eminently desirable for critical infrastructures. The article covers the basics of a theory of deterministic queuing systems Network calculus, its evolution regarding the relationship between backlog bound and delay, and a technique for handling empirical data. The problems being solved by the deterministic approach: standard calculation of network performance measures, estimation of database maximum updating time, and cybersecurity assessment including such issues as the CIA triad representation, operational technology influence, and availability understanding focusing on its correlation with a delay are thoroughly discussed as well. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093947502

It argues that the PRC's deployment of sophisticated attacks in the form of cyber coercion continues to be part of its geostrategic playbook to exert its influence and prosecute its wider interests as a rising power in the Indo-Pacific region. However, it observes that cyber coercion will be employed by the PRC in concert with all the other tools-diplomatic, economic, and the political- A cross the spectrum. The paper has two broad goals: First to unpack the trends or patterns in the PRC-sponsored cyber coercion by accentuating contextual and operational dimensions using Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea as analytical case studies; second, to highlight the opportunities and limitations of using cyber coercion as an asymmetrical capability in the changing threat landscape. The paper concludes that the PRC's cyber coercion is characterized by blurring the distinction on what constitutes compellence and deterrence. The boundaries are not clear cut, and to a certain degree both are even mutually reinforcing. The in-depth analysis of the case studies reveals the growing prominence of disinformation campaigns in close coordination with cyber operations (malware, phishing, and DDoS attack).

Researchers have proven in recent years that attacks on in-vehicle networks of automotive vehicles are possible and the research community has investigated various cybersecurity mitigation techniques and intrusion detection systems which can be adopted in the automotive sector. In comparison to conventional intrusion detection systems in large fixed networks and ICT infrastructures in general, in-vehicle systems have limited computing capabilities and other constraints related to data transfer and the management of cryptographic systems. In addition, it is important that attacks are detected in a short time-frame as cybersecurity attacks in vehicles can lead to safety hazards. This paper proposes an approach for intrusion detection of cybersecurity attacks in in-vehicle networks, which takes in consideration the constraints listed above. The approach is based on the application of an information entropy-based method based on a sliding window, which is quite efficient from time point of view, it does not require the implementation of complex cryptographic systems and it still provides a very high detection accuracy. Different entropy measures are used in the evaluation: Shannon Entropy, Renyi Entropy, Sample Entropy, Approximate Entropy, Permutation Entropy, Dispersion and Fuzzy Entropy. This paper evaluates the impact of the different hyperparameters present in the definition of entropy measures on a very large public data set of CAN-bus traffic with millions of CAN-bus messages with four different types of attacks: Denial of Service, Fuzzy Attack and two spoofing attacks related to RPM and Gear information. The sliding window approach in combination with entropy measures can detect attacks in a time-efficient way and with great accuracy for specific choices of the hyperparameters and entropy measures. © 2020 by the author.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092519592

In this paper, we devise a new text classification model based on deep learning to classify CSI-positive and-negative tweets from a collection of tweets. For this, we propose a novel word embedding model, called contrastive word embedding, that enables to maximize the difference between base embedding models. First, we define CSI-positive and-negative corpora, which are used for constructing embedding models. Here, to supplement the imbalance of tweet data sets, we additionally employ the background knowledge for each tweet corpus: (1) CVE data set for CSI-positive corpus and (2) Wikitext data set for CSI-negative corpus. Second, we adopt the deep learning models such as CNN or LSTM to extract adequate feature vectors from the embedding models and integrate the feature vectors into one classifier. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compare our method with two baseline classification models: (1) a model based on a single embedding model constructed with CSI-positive corpus only and (2) another model with CSI-negative corpus only. As a result, we indicate that the proposed model shows high accuracy, i.e., 0.934 of F1-score and 0.935 of area under the curve (AUC), which improves the baseline models by 1.76∼6.74% of F1-score and by 1.64∼6.98% of AUC. © 2020 by the authors.

On the one hand, this enables cooperation, as they can use the group to protect these norms and reinforce state control on transnational flows. In addition, this facilitates the formation of ties among foreign policy and bureaucratic elites across the BRICS who share a preference for protecting these norms. On the other hand, the importance attached to these norms constrains cooperation: differences of regime type are associated to higher levels of distrust; and intragroup power asymmetries raise fears of potential unequal agreements. The paper then applies these ideas to indicate the potential for cooperation on anti-drug and cybersecurity policies. On the one hand, different regime types and power inequalities are likely to hinder cooperation. On the other hand, interests from foreign policy, political and bureaucratic elites in protecting norms, as well as in increasing state control on transnational flows and expand repression against new threats are likely to facilitate cooperation. © 2020 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088989463

It contributes value-add to the existing literature on securitization theory by evaluating the specific backgrounds and preexisting beliefs that securitizing actors bring with them to the securitization process. Taking the case of Singapore, this paper focuses on the military elites turned civilian politicans and policymakers that have been tasked with cyberspace governance. A discourse analysis shows how terminologies describing cyberspace as an “existential” issue and key personnel appointments with significant military backgrounds reflect the prevalance of military elites, terminologies, strategies that have become embedded within domestic cybersecurity governance structures. The use of military-style concepts such as “digital ranges” and “war games” in Singapore mirrors global financial industry trends where military-derived terminology has become widespread in preparing for cyber-attacks on critical information infrastructure. Two key focus areas of cyberspace governance are evaluated: online content regulation of Internet and social media networks, and legislation to protect critical information infrastructure.

Over the last few decades, we have seen some major changes in the way in which we share information. In particular, we have moved into an age of electronically-shared content, and there is an increasing expectation in Canada that this content is both culturally significant and relevant. In this paper, we discuss an ongoing community engagement initiative with First Nations communities in the Western Manitoba region. The initiative involves knowledge-sharing activities that focus on the topic of cybersecurity, and are aimed at a public audience. This initial look into our educational project focuses on the conceptual analysis and planning stage. We are developing a 'Cybersecurity 101' mini-curriculum, to be implemented over several one-hour long workshops aimed at diverse groups (these public workshops may include a wide range of participants, from tech-adverse to tech-savvy). Learning assessment tools have been built in to the workshop program. We have created informational and promotional pamphlets, posters, lesson plans, and feedback questionnaires which we believe instill relevance and personal connection to this topic, helping to bridge gaps in accessibility for Indigenous communities while striving to build positive, reciprocal relationships. Our methodology is to approach the subject from a community needs and priorities perspective. Activities are therefore being tailored to fit each community. We hope this will lead to increased awareness and engagement by community members.

In this research, we propose visual analytics for generating feature maps of network events based on protocol information. We extract protocol information of ARP, TCP, and UDP from network traffic and generate each type of feature maps. Then for each event, we merge these three types into one image by putting them into different channels, to represent features.

Then for this multiclass classification problem, we adopt a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between these network events, with these eight types as labels and generated feature maps as inputs.

Our experiments were performed using a basic ROS 2 network consisting of two nodes (one publisher and one subscriber). Our experiments showed a measurable latency and throughput change between different QoS profiles and security settings. We analyze the trends and tradeoffs associated with varying QoS and security settings. This paper provides performance data points that can be used to help future researchers and developers make informative choices when using ROS 2 for UxS. © 2020 IEEE",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098918373

For example, security testing of automotive components is often performed at the late stages of development. Fuzz testing is often performed as part of the security testing activity. However, since testing occurs late in the development process, it is expensive and, in some cases, may be too late to fix certain identified issues. Another challenge is that some testing requires hardware that is costly and may not be available until late in the development. We suggest fuzz testing virtual ECUs, which overcomes these challenges and allows for more efficient and effective security testing. By incorporating fuzz testing of virtual electronic control units (ECUs) into the overall test platform, automotive companies can employ a continuous security testing approach that enables the organization to shift left to identify and fix vulnerabilities earlier in the software development life cycle. We explain an approach to performing fuzz testing of virtual ECUs as part of the continuous security process. To this end, we present a test setup for fuzz testing virtual ECUs and give an example of a prototype consisting of a Fuzz Testing Tool integrated with a software-in-the-loop (SiL) Tool. We describe methods for testing the upper layers of the ECU software, and as an example, we discuss results from fuzz testing a diagnostics services implementation on a virtual ECU. To highlight the benefits of fuzz testing virtual ECUs, we give an overview of a test platform architecture that allows for continuous security testing, including various types of security testing, of automotive components earlier in the software development life cycle. By using virtual ECUs in this test platform architecture, it is possible to perform fuzz testing earlier without the need for hardware, as well as perform testing in parallel to improve scalability. Moreover, since the usage of virtual ECUs allows for accessing the internals of the target system, it is possible to enable more intricate instrumentation of the target software to help detect exceptions on the ECU. Finally, besides using fuzz testing tools in the test platform architecture for continuous security testing, organizations can use static application security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools in the continuous integration (CI) step to identify issues in the embedded software at an early stage. © 2020 SAE International.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110277736

Most trade secrets today are stored in digital environments, readily transferable through the cyberspace, and accessed remotely (including possibly overseas) by the relevant employees; very few of these secrets, related to the most traditional branches of industries that find it difficult to dematerialize, originate physically or are not subsequently digitized in order to be stored, transferred and/or protected. Such protection, though, is only relatively safe. The negative side of mentioned trends is that when trade secrets are located in the cyberspace-for example, in Internet-connected devices, or in the so-called 'cloud', or even in corporate intranets-they can also be accessed and sometimes misappropriated by unauthorized individuals or entities (mostly external to the company) from literally anywhere in the world. It is no surprise that trade secrets misappropriations occur mostly this way, to an extent which is unprecedented and forced this issue on the policymakers' agenda, both domestically across several jurisdictions and globally via relevant international organizations. Indeed, not only does the economic value of the misappropriated secrets seem to increase dramatically year by year, but the nature of these crimes is changing too: if up to a couple of decades ago most unauthorized accesses to (and thefts of) trade secrets were performed physically by insiders and thus, obviously, fell within the reach of a specific jurisdiction, today companies and policymakers are confronted with thefts which extend on a transnational scale, originating all new problems in terms of inter alia prosecution, enforcement (eg of preliminary injunctions), recovery, evidence gathering and preservation, and award of damages. 'Trade secret laws exist to provide companies with a way of protecting their private knowledge from theft. However, industrial espionage predates the security concern over hackers using computers to steal IP.'1 Provided that certain companies and secrets are strategic for states themselves, different countries have been trying to respond to these challenges by updating their legislation or introducing new trade secrets-specific provisions, so that cyber-enabled misappropriation could face serious legal consequences domestically and even, when applicable, on the international plane. © 2020 Journal of Intellectual Property Law and Practice.

First, a large majority of cybersecurity measures do not fall within the limited set of exceptional circumstances listed in GATS Art. XIVbis.

The estimations suggest the plausible operation of a number of risk homeostasis dynamics: (1) commercial AV users are significantly more likely to self-report a cybersecurity event in the past year than nonusers, even after correcting for potential reverse causality and informational mechanisms; (2) nonusers become somewhat less likely to self-report a cybersecurity event as the perceived riskiness of various e-mail-based behaviors increases, while commercial AV users do not; (3) the negative short-run effect of commercial AV use on cybersecurity outcomes fade over time at a predicted rate of about 7.03 percentage points per year of use; and (4) after five years of use, commercial AV users are statistically indistinguishable from nonusers in terms of their probability of self-reporting a cybersecurity event as perceptions of risky e-mail-based behaviors increase. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086928834

Because of its fast and widespread adaptation to various diverse fields, machine learning can, and often is, treated as a black box. The disadvantage of doing so is that the decisions can often be difficult to interpret which can be especially challenging in the field of malware detection. Training deep neural networks also requires a vast amount of data from all classes which can be quite challenging in the field of proprietary software, specially for smaller research labs. In this paper, we introduce a framework which interpolates between samples of different classes at different layers to see how a deep network architecture generalizes to samples that are not in the training set, explaining the results of deep networks in real-world testing. Using this framework, we attempt to demystify the mechanisms behind the MalConv architecture [1] by analyzing the weights and gradients of multiple layers in its architecture and decipher what the architecture learns by analyzing raw bytes from the binary. For this architecture, our analysis shows that the network assigns much higher weights to specific portions of the executable Indicating that these portions contribute significantly more to the classification than other portions of the executable. Through the proposed framework, we can explain the mechanisms behind machine learning algorithms and explain their decisions better. In addition, the analyses will allow us to look inside existing networks without training them from scratch. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093839623

Since a specification that is poorly aligned with the inventive claims can render an invention unpatentable and can invalidate an already issued patent, an effective measure of alignment is necessary. We define a novel measure of drafting alignment using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The measure is defined for each patent document by first identifying the latent topics underlying the claims and the specification, and then using the Hellinger distance to find the proximity between the topical coverages. We demonstrate the use of the novel measure for data processing patent documents related to cybersecurity. The properties of the proposed measure are further investigated using exploratory data analysis, and it is shown that generally alignment is positively associated with the prior patenting efforts as well as the tendency to include figures in a document. © 2020 Khachatryan, Muehlmann.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088206058

It even starts to affect sectors that were not considered to be at risk in the past because of their relative isolation. One of these sectors is aviation in general, and specifically air traffic management (ATM). New developments in technology and the - -ever increasing - -trend to interconnect systems have drastically changed this landscape. Like many safety relevant sectors, the general attitude in aviation is rather conservative. Safety practitioners prefer slow changes, which conflicts with the ""rapid response""requirements coming from the (cyber)security area. Air traffic management systems are large socio-technical systems, a fact that adds an additional dimension to the cybersecurity complexity. In this paper I will address a subset of sector specific challenges that we have to address in the ATM domain. The number of challenges is quite substantial and topics like security policies, risk assessment methodologies and vulnerabilities in specific areas (e.g. ADS-B) can be found in the literature. This paper will look at two challenges that have received, so far, less attention: architecture and supply chain. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093094937

Secure cyberspace has been designated as one of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges in engineering. Broadly, the security threats are targeted on software programs, operating system and network with the intention to launch confidentiality, integrity and availability violations. Existing undergraduate and graduate-level cybersecurity education curriculum rely primarily on didactic teaching methods with little focus on student centered, inquiry-based teaching, known to improve student learning. With growing number of security incidents taking place, it is of utmost importance to prepare a workforce equipped with knowledge of the threat space and existing state-of-the-art solutions. Such comprehensive understanding is only possible by a dedicated hands-on course on cybersecurity where students can learn the key concepts by editing the hardware, software and OS, and, network policies. Unfortunately, such extensive and deep flexibilities are not provided in current cybersecurity curriculum. In this paper, we introduce a hands-on and modular self-learning Cybersecurity Training (CST) Kit to advance cybersecurity education. Students can promptly apply newly acquired knowledge on the CST Kit as part of the learning process. This Kit accompanies Do-It-Yourself (DIY) training modules that is used to model and investigate cybersecurity issues and their prevention to all levels of the cybersecurity workforce, including undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 science and technology teachers. The Kit also covers various aspects of cybersecurity issues including, hardware, software, operating system and network security. A coursework has been developed on hardware security for senior undergraduate and graduate students using the Kit. A preliminary survey conducted among students who were introduced to the modular board to implement hardware security threats such as, side-channel attack shows an 120% improvement in their understanding after the CST Kit based activities. The components of the CST Kit have also been used in a 4-day summer workshop for K-12 teachers. Teachers took pre- and post- concept inventories to assess their learning of content throughout the workshop and the results indicated improvement of 58%. These assessments focused on vulnerabilities and specific types of attacks, system security, data transmission and encryption, permutations and combinatorics, and binary numbers. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095757373

The purpose of this paper is to address some of the problematic issues associated with teaching programming by the utilisation of a new novel teaching approach called games-based construction learning (GBCL) to attempt to increase motivation, engagement and learning effectiveness. An international and national trend is to introduce coding at earlier education levels resulting in upper primary education (PE) being the focus of this paper to ascertain if GBCL using Scratch to teach programming concepts is more effective at different levels of upper PE. Design/methodology/approach: A large-scale empirical study introducing GBCL to teach programming concepts into 16 classes between levels 4 and 7 in PE utilising 384 children. A detailed implementation framework for GBCL using Scratch in PE was utilised to address all incorporation issues and the games constructed by the children scored utilising a game codification scheme specifically designed to address programming and design as a quantification rubric. The experiment utilised eight 1- h lessons on GBCL using Scratch. Findings: The resulted in 178 games of varying levels of complexity developed. The results indicated that GBCL was an effective mechanism to teach programming concepts using Scratch at all levels of upper PE. Primary seven students scored higher in relation to the design metric of the quantification codification rubric. Research limitations/implications: Under the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) in Scotland non-traditional teaching approaches are encouraged and development of digital literacy skill is highly advocated. This has resulted in a new approach, novel approach called GBCL where children create their own games utilising an engine such as Scratch is gaining significant attention in terms of being a novel approach. Despite a plethora of similar studies associated with GBCL, it is still not as developed as games-based learning and requires further empirical studies to support the validity of the approach and resolve identified issues. Practical implications: Computer programming itself can lead to a highly rewarding career in a number of sectors from games development to banking, such as cybersecurity and systems development. In the last decade, in particular due to the ubiquitous nature of technology there is an increasing international and national trend associated with teaching rudimentary programming concepts at a far younger age including secondary education and the upper PE level. Introducing programming at an earlier level is now being considered essential as the path to transfer from novice to expert programmer level in time is considered nearly a decade approximately. The introduction of GBCL interventions may yield positive results in a supplementary learning capacity in accordance with the CfE and increase the educational effectiveness of programming education in later levels of education. Originality/value: This study presents a large-scale empirical evaluation of GBCL in upper PE utilising a compiled implementation framework for incorporation and a detailed game codification scheme to quantify the games produced highlighting coding constructs and design. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068072386

Protecting and preventing these threats by using the conventional tools present important limits (cannot predict in real-time when, where, and how the new forms of these Dos attacks occur). To deal with these limits, cybersecurity systems based on machine learning models can analyze patterns and learn from them to forecast and prevent Dos attack. One of the key process which ensures the efficiency of these forecasting systems is feature selection. In this context, we paid particular attention to one of the efficient feature selection methods used in forecasting cybersecurity systems: Wrapper based-feature.

However, research suggests that analysts are dissatisfied with existing metrics as they fail to take into consideration several aspects of their tasks. Existing works advocate for research into this area. A major challenge to devising adequate metrics is that the real work of analysts that needs to be taken into consideration to assess their holistic performance has not been fully discussed. Furthermore, at present, there is no agreement on what constitutes core analysts' functions. Analysts' overall performance in a SOC could be obtained if there is a common agreement on the core functions upon which their performance can be evaluated. In this paper, we propose a framework depicting the core functions of analysts and KPIs that can be used to measure the performance of analysts. To do this, we conducted a thorough analysis of the functions of a SOC described in multiple sources of literature and engaged with several analysts and SOC managers from different industries using qualitative semi-structured interviews. Our research results identify the following: quality of analysts' analysis, quality of analysts' report, time-based measures and the absolute numbers derived from an analyst's tasks as the key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing analysts' performance. We hope that our findings will stimulate more interest among cybersecurity researchers on assessment methods for analysts. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091981430

After colonizing a surface, bacterial populations form biofilms, which is their natural protection mechanism against physical attacks, harmful chemical compounds and environmental changes. Recent studies have shown that bacteria can be engineered to act as biosensors and bioactuators, externally controlled by electric signals. Despite the benefits provided by biosensors in terms of metabolic diseases diagnosis and treatment, they also open the door to novel cyberbioattacks due to the impossibility of implementing security mechanisms in resource-constrained engineered bacteria. In this context, we have reproduced a distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyberbioattack performed by engineered bacteria that diffuse jamming signals affecting the production of the biofilm structure. A pool of experiments has shown that higher amplitudes and periods in the signal controlling the engineered bacteria have a greater impact on the biofilm disruption. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091813386

In or-der to prevent cyber incidents happening on ships and in the companies, essential steps must be taken on the management level. This paper introduces results of two surveys on cybersecurity and cyber awareness carried out in between 2017 – 2019 among the shipping companies operating in Estonia. Feedback was received from 12 shipowners out of 19 and the results show that at least 7 organisations had been the victims to different types of cyberattacks. The results indicate that shipowners are not paying enough of attention to potential cyber threats and education of their employees.

This methodology requires that the designed system structure be defined in terms of cooperating agents having well-defined internal components exhibiting specified behaviours. System activities are defined in terms of finite state machines and behaviours parameterised by transition functions. In the investigated case the multi-modal interface is a component of the Operational Centre which is a part of the National Cybersecurity Platform. Embodied agents have been successfully used in the design of robotic systems. However robots operate in physical environments, while cyberspace events visualisation involves cyberspace, thus the applied design methodology required a different definition of the environment. It had to encompass the physical environment in which the operator acts and the computer screen where the results of those actions are presented. Smart human–computer interaction (HCI) is a time-aware, dynamic process in which two parties communicate via different modalities, e.g., voice, gesture, eye movement. The use of computer vision and machine intelligence techniques are essential when the human is carrying an exhausting and concentration demanding activity. The main role of this interface is to support security analysts and operators controlling visualisation of cyberspace events like incidents or cyber attacks especially when manipulating graphical information. Visualisation control modalities include visual gesture-and voice-based commands. © 2020 by the authors.

As an initial scoping exercise, the present case study explores whether such devices could be remotely hijacked and then maliciously power-cycled at particular frequencies to deliberately provoke harmful oscillations in an electrical grid. To gauge the broad feasibility of this novel style of attack, dynamic simulations are performed on two representative test power systems, at differing levels of attacker and defender resources. These simulations show that power-cycling just 1% of consumer loads at a system's resonant frequency may sometimes provoke harmful electromechanical oscillations throughout a national grid.

It comes as no surprise that the effects of breaches and the eventual compromise of data continues to impact every level from large corporations down to the individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to provide individuals with a comparative method to retrieve a common baseline of their cybersecurity posture versus an acceptable established standard. Existing audit measures are quite cumbersome and introduce room for errors. Using PowerShell provides a method to automate parsing information into a company's existing policy and expose any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

I argue that a moderately restrictive approach should be adopted, which holds that private firms can justifiably launch some cybersecurity services - defensive measures - but are not permitted to perform others - offensive measures. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

The second part presents a matching empirical overview of more than 180 European governance networks on police and criminal cooperation, counterterrorism, border security, migration policy, cybersecurity and disaster prevention. Expertise-driven and policy field-specific dynamics appear significant to account for the breadth and variety of policy networks.

We pursue a non-parametric approach to the problem and investigate various score functions to quantify association, including characteristics of marked point processes and summary statistics of interevent times. Two techniques are proposed for assessing the significance of the measured degree of association: a population-based approach to calculating score-based likelihood ratios when a sample from a relevant population is available, and a resampling approach to computing coincidental match probabilities when only a single pair of event series is available.

In order to develop and verify such countermeasures, the administrators should be able to reenact both cyber-attacks and defenses. Simulations can be useful for the reenactment by overcoming its limitations including high risk and cost. If the administrators are able to design various scenarios of cyber-attacks and to develop simulation models from their viewpoints, they can simulate desired situations and observe the results more easily. It is challenging to simulate cyber-security issues, because there is lack of theoretical basis for modeling a wide range of the security field as well as pre-defined basic components used to model cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a modeling method for cyber-security simulations by developing a basic component and a composite model, called Abstracted Cyber-Security Unit Model (ACSUM) and Abstracted Cyber-security SIMulation model (ACSIM), respectively. The proposed models are based on DEVS(Discrete Event systems Specification) formalism, a modeling theory for discrete event simulations. We develop attack scenarios by sequencing attack behaviors using ACSUMs and then model ACSIMs by combining and abstracting the ACSUMs from a security perspective. The concepts of ACSUM and ACSIM enable the security administrators to simulate numerous cyber-security issues from their viewpoints. As a case study, we model a worm scenario using ACSUM and simulate three types of simulation models based on ACSIM from a different security perspective.

The security of academic information systems is very important to maintain information optimally and safely. Along with the development of technology, academic information systems are often misused by some irresponsible parties that can cause threats. To prevent these things from happening, it is necessary to know the extent to which the security of the academic information system of universities is conducted by evaluating. So the research was conducted to determine the Maturity Level on the governance of the security of University Ahmad Dahlan academic information system by using the COBIT 5 framework on the DSS05 domain. The DSS05 domain on COBIT 5 is a good framework to be used in implementing and evaluating related to the security of academic information systems. Whereas to find out the achievement of evaluation of academic information system security level, CMMI method is needed. The combination of the COBIT 5 framework on the DSS05 domain using the CMMI method in academic information system security is able to provide a level of achievement in the form of a Maturity Level value. The results of the COBIT 5 framework analysis of the DSS05 domain use the CMMI method to get a Maturity level of 4,458 so that it determines the achievement of the evaluation of academic information systems at the tertiary level is Managed and Measurable. This level, universities are increasingly open to technological developments.

There are millions of devices being connected to a central domain to provide different types of services. Since these low-powered IoT devices have constrained technical requirements with less computational capabilities, they lack the capacity to judge their behavior as benign or malignant. IoT relies heavily on the higher level of intelligent nodes to decide on their status. An IoT Controller/Edge server handles the registration and the limited management of devices. Since traditional security is unable to protect the IoT environment sufficiently, we present a Blockchain-based DDoS detection approach to secure and mitigate such attacks in the IoT environment. Our test setup includes dataset from four sensors over two months. These values were tested using a threshold calculation against the variation of temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind direction on that day to find out whether an IoT sensor is under a DDoS attack.

In this paper, we explore a gradient boosting decision tree, especially LightGBM, which is a relatively new and powerful method, to predict future malware attacks on cloud computing systems. We use a large and sparse dataset provided by Microsoft and show that our approach is suitable for predicting malware attacks using large datasets with 73.89% accuracy compared to conventional machine learning methods. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087914749

Of particular note, the cloud services can apply in order to create concurrent redundant system for implementation of disaster recovery feature of SCADA information resources during different deliberate malicious impacts and intrusions. However, in spite of the fact that usage of the cloud services allow to enhance functionality of SCADA system, there are dependability and cybersecurity aspects for their joint utilization hat keep to remain a serious challenge for service personnel and users.

Most prior works detect malicious domains based on individual features, which are only related to the attributes of domains themselves and can be easily changed to avoid detection. To solve the problem, we propose a novel system called MalPortrait, which combines individual features and association information of domains to detect malicious domains. In MalPortrait, we show the association information among domains by a domain association graph where vertices represent domains and edges connect domains resolved to the same IP. Based on the graph, we combine individual features (e.g., string-based, network-based) of each domain and its association information to generate new features. Compared with individual features, the new features are harder to be tampered with and can help determine whether a domain is malicious from a more comprehensive perspective. We evaluate MalPortrait on the passive DNS traffic collected from real-world large ISP networks. Our experimental results show that MalPortrait can accurately identify malicious domain names with a precision of 96.8% and a recall of 95.5%. Compared with prior works, MalPortrait performs better and hardly relies on additional knowledge (e.g., IP reputation, Domain whois). © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087282349

Utilising the increasing power of communications and access to information, various collaborative networked organisations are established to respond quickly to emerging market demands while sharing resources and risk. The governance of such organisations remains a significant challenge. Therefore, in the process of designing a governance model for a cybersecurity network, a research team in the Horizon 2020 ECHO project pursued several venues to identify and prioritise governance needs and objectives. This paper presents the approach to soliciting the views of two groups of stakeholders - funding organisations and potential major customers of cybersecurity products and services - by conducting semi-structured interviews. The research method included quantitative and qualitative techniques for processing the inter-views, allowing to prioritise governance requirements from an initial list and to identify additional governance issues. As a result, the geographic representation in the networked organisation, the involvement of external stakeholders, the decision-making arrangements, and the need to provide for confidentiality emerged as governance issues of highest concern, followed by supply chain security, representation on the senior governance bodies, auditing, management of disputes and intellectual property rights, setting up an ethics code and policies for gender representation, transparency, accountability, and integrity. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087056281

There are currently several organizations that can certify an education program that is focused on cybersecurity or similar areas. However, for individuals who are not within the cybersecurity field, such as those who are not yet finished with their high school education, those who are within another discipline at the University or College level, or those who are outside of the education system entirely, then there is no such entities or guidelines for programs to inform them about cybersecurity and privacy related issues and topics. This does not mean though, that these individuals have any less of a need for some training in the basics of cybersecurity and privacy protection that will affect everyone's daily life. Since these individuals are not exposed to the curriculums that might enable them to recognize or gain an understanding of the reasons behind practices that are common place for everyone, such as password requirements, then there could be an even greater need for them to be exposed to it in a controlled and consistent manner.

Domain names play a significant role in the connection with a server, considered as a key for detecting these attacks. In this paper, we propose a text-based method to convert domain names into numeric features, based on the term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Then we adopt the variational autoencoder (VAE) consisting of an encoder and a decoder, extracting hidden information from features. Moreover, through collapsing the Gaussian distribution of these features at the hidden layer to its mean, the distribution of domain names is visualized. After that, we adopt a supervised learning called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification between the malicious and benign. We train the model using feature vectors from the VAE.

The conventional security mechanisms have come a long way in securing the well-defined objectives of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability. Nevertheless, with the growth in the system complexities and attack sophistication, providing security via traditional means are increasingly becoming unachievable. A novel theoretical perspective and an innovative approach are thus required for understanding security from a decision-making and strategic viewpoint. One of the analytical tools which may assist the researchers in designing security protocols for computer networks is game theory. The game-theoretic concept finds extensive applications in security at different levels, including the cyberspace and is generally categorized under security games. It can be utilized as a robust mathematical tool for modelling and analyzing contemporary security issues. Game theory offers a natural framework for capturing the defensive as well as adversarial interactions between the defenders and the attackers. Furthermore, defenders can attain a deep understanding of the potential attack threats and the strategies of attackers by equilibrium evaluation of the security games. In this paper, the concept of game theory has been presented, followed by game-theoretic applications in cybersecurity, including cryptography. Different types of games, particularly those focused on securing the cyberspace, have been analysed and varied game-theoretic methodologies including mechanism design theories have been outlined for offering a modern foundation of the science of cybersecurity. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083978869

The core problem of the situation is the imbalance between the offensive and defensive sides due to information asymmetry. Moving Target Defense (MTD) technology is a kind of technology that hopes to confuse attackers by implementing continuous and dynamic changes, and implement these changes on the attack surface of the protected system, so as to increase the attack costs and reduce the attack success rate. With the development of the research in this field, how to optimize the dynamic defense strategy and realize the balance of costs and benefits in intelligent defense has become the focus of the existing research on MTD technology. However, existing decision-making schemes or optimization models often have problems such as improper description of the actual attack and defense scenarios with strong purposes, insufficient prediction of the state of the attack and defense process, inability to deal with unknown types of attacks, lack of quantitative evaluation of utility, and lack of consideration for system users. In view of the above problems, we innovatively take users as the third participant in MTD game, and put forward a MTD technology based on the asymmetrical trilateral game model with the combination of Stackelberg game and Markov model. In this model, we first define the structure of the game model: asymmetrical trilateral game. The offensive and defensive sides participate in the game as equal players, while the user is at a disadvantage as a third player in the game and has an asymmetrical relationship with the other two participants. In addition, we also assume that the user, as an independent participant, does not interact with the attacker and the defender, that is, the user does not aware of the existence of the attack and defense game and does not care about the result of attack and defense, but only focuses on the functions and performances of the current system. Then, under the assumption of the trilateral game model, we adopt the traditional Stackelberg game model of sequential offense and defense, and put forward the trilateral sequential game model of ""attacker first, defender later, and user stochastically"". Specifically, we summarize the game in each timestep into a Markov process unit, so that the whole series of the trilateral game process is built into a Markov model in the timeline. According to this, we define the three participants' respective utility and the relationship between them, in which the cost and benefit of the defender and the user are both taken into account. Through the first-order game prediction and the k-order game prediction, the optimal strategy of MTD under the current time step is determined. Compared with the existing game between offensive and defensive sides, this model optimizes the user experience of using the system, improves the adaptability of the model, makes the optimization convergence process more consistent with the actual scenes and can be applied to the complex attack scenes, which has a better effect of process state prediction. Mathematical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that the model can give consideration to both the defender and the user by balancing their utilities, avoid excessive defense and inappropriate defense strategies, so as to effectively realize the intelligent defense strategy decision-making. © 2020, Science Press.

Since financial resources for investment in security are limited, optimal allocation of these cybersecurity resources in the grid is extremely important. At the same time, optimization of these investments proves to be challenging due to the uncertain behavior of attackers and the dynamically changing threat landscape. Existing solutions for this problem either do not address the dynamic behavior of adversaries or lack in the practical feasibility of the defense models. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing investment strategies in the cybersecurity infrastructure of a smart grid using a game-theoretic approach. The attacker is modeled using various attacker profiles which represent the possible types of adversaries in the context of CPS. Each profile has certain characteristics to bring out the aspect of uncertain behavior of the adversaries. The defender is modeled with various pragmatic characteristics that can be easily translated to the real-world grid scenarios for implementation. These characteristics include the standards laid down by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) commonly known as the NERC-CIP standards. The game-theoretic framework allows us to obtain optimal strategies that the defender of the grid can adopt to minimize its losses against the possible attack threats on the grid. The concept is illustrated by a simplistic 3-bus power system model case study which depicts how the solution can be translated to practical implementation in the actual grid. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086263726

Such networks collect sensitive information over time that represent the users' behavioral patterns, which necessitates the need of safe data communication. IoT distributed systems are incurred with cyber-security challenges that need to be considered for lightweight heterogonous devices. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) schemes have been proposed to provide secure data communication between networked devices in unsecure channels by specifying an access policy to be solely verified when a set of attributes of the decrypting user satisfies the access policy. Primitives based on elliptic curves, on the other hand, provide much smaller key bit sizes than other cryptographic algorithms at the same security strength. Several state-of-the-art works have introduced no-pairing ABE schemes that eliminate the need of the computationally expensive bilinear pairing operations, but few have implemented no-pairing ECC-based ABE schemes on resource-constrained platforms for IoT applications. In this paper, a no-pairing ECC-based KPABE scheme is implemented on different IoT platforms of constrained computing capabilities. The performance evaluation in terms of time execution against increasing number of attributes is presented and benchmarked with the scheme's implementation on a computer.

Over the past few years adversaries have found ways to develop malwares which are specifically designed to hit the target and have also been quite successful as well. This also shows that adversaries are much ahead in terms of their strategy and are technically skilled to outpace the traditional controls. An analysis of last few cyber-attack trend provides a very insightful information that most of the attacks are initiated by targeting the end user. Hence end user is seen as a weak link. Also in most of the organizations cyber security trainings are limited to security team members without giving much importance to the normal users. Therefore if employees are not trained enough to recognize a security threat, they cannot be expected to avoid it, report it or remove it. Employees need cybersecurity awareness and training to protect themselves and the company against new evolving cyber-attacks. By making employees aware of new forms of security threats and what measures to follow when a suspicious activity is identified, we can then strengthen the most vulnerable links in the chain. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085002179

The ECS communications architecture is a mission-critical ICS and is divided into multiple levels with unique requirements and features from the process up through the station and finally to the control center. Using these levels, it is possible to identify interacting cyber defense technologies, the levels at which they should be deployed, and which devices they belong to (IEC 62443 Part 3) instead of the arbitrary defense-in-breadth strategy of requesting that every device include every cyber defense technology (IEC 62443 Part 4). © 2020 IET Conference Publications.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107358041

Typical considerations of deception view it as providing false information. However, just as important but less frequently studied is a more tacit form where information is strategically hidden or leaked. We consider the problem of how much an adversary can affect a principal s decision by ""half-Truths"", that is, by masking or hiding bits of information, when the principal is oblivious to the presence of the adversary. The principal s problem can be modeled as one of predicting future states of variables in a dynamic Bayes network, and we show that, while theoretically the principal s decisions can be made arbitrarily bad, the optimal attack is NP-hard to approximate, even under strong assumptions favoring the attacker. However, we also describe an important special case where the dependency of future states on past states is additive, in which we can efficiently compute an approximately optimal attack.

For autonomous driving where the system heavily interacts with its environment by means of sensor (fusion) and actuators, hazard consideration has to be expanded from E/E system malfunctioning behavior to also cover Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) including cybersecurity. Scenario-based HARA can capture how to analyze hazards considering Functional Safety (FuSa) and SOTIF, but their relation and inter dependencies need to be represented in a systematic way. Moreover, powerful methods like System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) are used to identify, define, and analyze hazards but not risk assessments. Therefore, we investigate state-of-the-art on scenario-based HARA and propose an extended HARA that combines FuSa and SOTIF. In particular, we consider (a) functional scenario representation and selection of scenarios (e.g. drawing basic and accident scenarios in HARA) and (b) methods to find the relation and interactions of FuSa and SOTIF at once for each HAD function.

Thus, cybersecurity emerges as crucial tenet within the 5G pathway. In this article, we discuss the concept of agile security within a 5G infrastructure taking into account two of its major technologies: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). In this sense, we first discuss the 5G-driven MEC deployment from a NFV perspective. Secondly, we present the concept of agile security and how it can be embedded in the daily activities of mobile network operators (MNOs). Thirdly, we discuss risk management as a key element of the agile security framework. To illustrate its application, we propose the design of an agile security risk-aware edge server mechanism for 5G driven MEC deployment, which uses multiple thresholds and a load-balancing security control to mitigate the risks of resource exhaustion and violation of the service level agreement (SLA) faced by the edge servers while taking advantage of multiple cloud layers to increase the degree of availability and dependability of the system.

Like any other economic resource, information has a value that you need to not only increase, but also be able to protect during the process of entrepreneurship. The most developed resource screening tool with the special features is structured analysis and design technique of real options. Real options are defined as valuable, rare and difficult to reproduce abilities or resources that create exclusive opportunities for the entrepreneur to choose strategies for developing his activities. Each real option has its own specifics, which necessitates a certain modification of the general methodology for specific conditions. When choosing a strategy for ensuring cybersecurity as a basic protected resource, structural (organizational) capital should be recognized, since an entrepreneur does not have legal ownership rights for employees and, accordingly, for their human capital. Nevertheless, the costs of protecting intellectual property arising from joint organizational and labor activities should be taken into account. According to statistics, up to 40% of all information leakages are associated with relationships within the organization and the attitude of staff towards work, respectively, the cost of a protected resource should take into account the level and state of organizational culture. Proceeding from special aspects of cybersecurity, it should be resorted to indirect measurements of the volatility of the main resource. The methods and indicators of indirect measurements should follow from the methods for assessing the main resource in the option, which will be the directions of subsequent studies. © Copyright 2021 by Turkish Society of Colon and Rectal Surgery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102193252

As being one of the pillars of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, DT-s are widely integrated into the existing factories, enhancing the concept of the virtual factories. View from the research perspective is that experiments on the Internet of Things, data acquisition, cybersecurity, telemetry synchronization with physical factories, etc. are being executed in those virtual simulations. Moreover, new ways of interactions and interface to oversee, interact and learn are being developed via the assistance of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, which are already widely spread on the consumer market. However, already, VR is being used widely in existing commercial software packages and toolboxes to provide students, teachers, operators, engineers, production managers, and researchers with an immersive way of interacting with the factory while the manufacturing simulation is running. This gives a better understanding and more in-depth knowledge of the actual manufacturing processes, not being directly accessing those. However, the virtual presence mentioned above experience is limited to a single person. It does not enable additional functionalities for the simulations, which can be re-planning or even re-programming of the physical factory in an online connection by using VR or AR interfaces. The main aim of the related research paper is to enhance already existing fully synchronized with physical world DT-s with multi-user experience, enabling factory operators to work with and reprogram the real machinery from remote locations in a more intuitive way instead thinking about final aim than about the process itself. Moreover, being developed using real-time platform Unity3D, this multiplayer solution gives opportunities for training and educational purposes and is connecting people from remote locations of the world. Use-cases exploits industrial robots placed in the Industrial Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory environment of Tallinn University of Technology and a mobile robot solution developed based on a collaboration between the University of Southern Denmark and a Danish company. Experiments are being performed on the connection between Estonia and Denmark while performing reprogramming tasks of the physical heavy industrial robots.

To understand and predict location disclosure behavior, we developed an Android app that scraped metadata from users’ phones, asked them to grant the location-sharing permission to the app, and administered a survey. We compared the effectiveness of using self-report measures commonly used in the social sciences, behavioral data collected from users’ mobile phones, and a new type of measure that we developed, representing a hybrid of self-report and behavioral data to contextualize users’ attitudes toward their past location-sharing behaviors. This new type of measure is based on a reflective learning paradigm where individuals reflect on past behavior to inform future behavior. Based on data from 380 Android smartphone users, we found that the best predictors of whether participants granted the location-sharing permission to our app were: behavioral intention to share information with apps, the “FYI” communication style, and one of our new hybrid measures asking users whether they were comfortable sharing location with apps currently installed on their smartphones. Our novel, hybrid construct of self-reflection on past behavior significantly improves predictive power and shows the importance of combining social science and computational science approaches for improving the prediction of users’ privacy behaviors. Further, when assessing the construct validity of the Behavioral Intention construct drawn from previous location-sharing research, our data showed a clear distinction between two different types of Behavioral Intention: self-reported intention to use mobile apps versus the intention to share information with these apps. This finding suggests that users desire the ability to use mobile apps without being required to share sensitive information, such as their location. These results have important implications for cybersecurity research and system design to meet users’ location-sharing privacy needs. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101213165

Security has a crucial role in the modern digital world and has become an essential area of research. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are among the first security systems that encounter network attacks and facilitate attack detection to protect a network. Contemporary machine learning approaches, like novel neural network architectures, are succeeding in network intrusion detection. This paper tests modern machine learning approaches on a novel cybersecurity benchmark IoT dataset. Among other algorithms, Deep AutoEncoder (DAE) and modified Long Short Term Memory (mLSTM) are employed to detect network anomalies in the IoT-23 dataset. The DAE is employed for dimensionality reduction and a host of ML methods, includ-ing Deep Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory to classify the outputs of into normal/malicious.

The prevention of this risk is a big research issue and it needs to be solved. There is a need for trusted IOT computing in recent times to provide trusted services. Here, we propose the integration of TPM in IOT computing to performs cryptographic operations and provide hardware-based security. In this domain, different schemes and methods have been proposed to build trust in IOT computing, but the suitable solution has not been presented by these schemes because these schemes lack in terms of some security services. A comparative study based on trusted computing schemes has also been presented in this paper along with different implementations of critical analysis. Our study is based on an overview of the main issues and summarizing the literature along with their strengths and limitations.

Several international organizations have taken cybersecurity policy initiatives, notably the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU). Both organizations aspire to a leading role in enhancing cybersecurity resilience. To date, however, these initiatives have not resulted in much regulation. This article examines which factors make lawmaking and the regulation of cybersecurity difficult at the international level, and whether some of these impediments are shared at the EU legislative level. Are difficulties in regulating cybersecurity embedded in the normative processes at the UN or the EU, or are they inherent to the high-tech phenomenon of cyber? As for the UN, the article looks at the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE). While previous reports of the UN GGE seemed to point to an emerging international opinio juris, recent developments in the UN General Assembly (UNGA) show a strongly divided international community.

The measure of an adequate level of protection is an indicator of the cybersecurity awareness aspects of an organization's business processes in the short, medium, and long term, especially in the field that deals with information and communication technology (ICT). To make this happen, it requires a security standard that is appropriate and follows its needs to help organizations know the maturity level of cybersecurity in protecting its information security. The ABC organization is one of the Government agencies that manage the critical infrastructure and Indonesian digital economies. The organization has currently implemented several international security standards through its planning, implementation, evaluation document, and ICT activities. However, based on the national information security readiness assessment, information security management readiness results are still not optimal. In this study, an analysis of the NIST, ISO 27002, COBIT, and PCI DSS security standards has been carried out, which are ABC organizational security standards in managing ICT by assigned tasks and functions. Furthermore, the analysis result is used as materials for drafting a cybersecurity maturity framework through the four standard approaches that have become the basis for ICT management.

Stakeholder capitalism will result in collaboration among various stakeholders, and this can help in addressing global challenges. The study found that when companies embrace stakeholder capitalism, they serve society at large through various activities, supporting the communities within which they operate and paying a fair share of taxes. The payment of tax can help address inequality. Taxes will be used by the governments to fund various social welfare projects that would help reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.

In the following, typical attack strategies and principles for defence are reviewed, followed by cryptographic techniques, malware and two common weaknesses in software: buffer overflows and SQL injections. Subsequently, selected topics from network security, namely reconnaissance, firewalls, Denial of Service attacks, and Network Intrusion Detection Systems, are analysed. Finally, the chapter reviews techniques for continuous testing, stressing the need for a free distribution of dual-use tools. Although introductory in nature, this chapter already addresses a number of ethical issues. For instance, well-intended security mechanisms may have undesired side effects such as leaking sensitive information to attackers. As asymmetries and externalities are at the core of many security problems, devising effective security solutions that are adopted in practice is a challenge. © 2020, The Author(s).",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098079101

In addition to the four value clusters, domain-specific values that are served by computer systems, such as health, are important. Following a detailed discussion of the four relevant value clusters, potential value conflicts and value tensions are considered. The relationships of five pairs of values (privacy-security, privacy-fairness, privacy-accountability, security-accountability and security-fairness) are analysed in terms of whether they are largely supportive or conflicting. In addition, possible methods for addressing these potential value conflicts are discussed.

Furthermore, the role of the new European data protection framework is addressed, and it is explained why data protection has a close relationship to security matters. The main tensions and conflicts in relation to IT and cybersecurity are depicted, which evolve primarily around the frequently negative effect of IT and cybersecurity measures on the rights of data subjects. However, the issue of governmental surveillance is also addressed, with its implications for the fundamental rights of European citizens. Solution approaches to align the two domains of data protection and cybersecurity are explored, since cybersecurity incidents often involve the loss or compromise of an individual’s personal information. To this end, overlaps and synergies are examined that seem promising for a more holistic approach to cyber threats. For instance, this could be achieved by applying principles such as data protection by design and default in IT more thoroughly.

Besides providing innovative services, business owners must focus on investing in robust cybersecurity mechanisms to countermeasure cyberattacks. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks remain one of the most dangerous cyberattacks, e.g., leading to service disruption, financial loss, and reputation harm. Although protection measures exist, a catalog of solutions is missing, which could help network operators to access and filter information in order to select suitable protections for specific demands. This work presents ProtectDDoS, a platform offering recommendations of DDoS protections. ProtectDDoS provides a blockchain-based catalog, where DDoS protection providers can announce details regarding their services, while users can obtain recommendations of DDoS protections according to their specific demands (e.g., price, attacks supported, or geolocation constraints). ProtectDDoS’s Smart Contract (SC) maintains the integrity of data about protections available and provides tamper-proof reputation.

We analyzed similarities and differences between learner groups using frequency, entropy and cosine similarity measures applied to n-gram features of their written responses. Our analysis showed that there is a difference in mental models between learners with informal exposure to cybersecurity topics and those with formal exposure.

Satellites and other space assets, just like other parts of the digitized critical infrastructure, are vulnerable to cyberattack. Cyber vulnerabilities in space therefore pose serious risks for ground based critical infrastructure, and insecurities in the space environment. Cyber defense mechanisms are typically associated with more complexity in configuration, operational procedures and less optimal performance. Hence it is critical to assess the cyber vulnerability of space assets and the impact of cyber breach on any of them. Aerospace cybersecurity threat vector assessment is critical to estimate the impact of adverse incidences and necessary corrective actions. Prevention, detection, and corrective controls are assessed with quantitative risk assessment models. Aerospace cyber threat vector audit matrix is created with the help of graphical probabilistic models. As real time threat assessment indicators change, automated preemptive SIEM actions are taken. Threat vector assessment based on probabilistic models provide a mechanism to prioritize the cyber defense mechanisms and enables stake holders to optimize between cyber security, complexity of space systems, and operational effectiveness. © 2020 The MITRE Corporation.

A variety of cryptocurrency-based botnets have been proposed and developed to utilize cryptocurrencies as new command and control (C&C) platforms. Most existing cryptocurrency-based botnets are bonded with the cryptocurrency client, which generates abnormal P2P traffic that can be easily detected and blocked. In addition, the commands embedded in transaction records can be easily traced, since the transaction records in a cryptocurrency network are usually publicly available. In this paper, we propose CoinBot, a novel botnet that based on the cryptocurrency networks. CoinBot is characterized by low cost, high resilience, stealthiness, and anti-traceability. Different from other cryptocurrency-based botnet, CoinBot utilizes Web2.0 services to achieve a dynamic addressing service for obtaining commands. As such, there is no need to run a cryptocurrency wallet application and hardcode a botmaster’s sensitive information in CoinBot, and the communications between the botmaster and the bots are hidden under legitimate HTTP/S traffic. Furthermore, we propose a cleaning scheme to prevent commands from being permanently recorded in the blockchain, thereby decreasing the risk of channel exposure. CoinBot is a generic model that can be applied to different kinds of cryptocurrency networks. We believe this model will be highly attractive to botmasters and could pose a considerable threat to cybersecurity. Therefore, we provide defensive suggestions to mitigate similar threats in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097651143

Industry 4.0 wave is based on cyber-physical production systems (CPS), aiming to connect the physical and digital production spaces. Under this framework, Industry 4.0 digital operations require the re-establishment of IT systems, in a way that human and machines are interconnected and interact in real-time, thus creating a more flexible, resourceefficient and optimal way of manufacturing. To this end, Industry 4.0 encompasses concepts that include Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in manufacturing, which promotes better smart production phases. Under the new digital framework of Industry 4.0, the role of proximity in advancing innovation partnerships and promoting efficient technology and knowledge transfer among the engaged partners, should be carefully examined. It becomes clear that stakeholders' coordination activities, which will ensure their efficient cooperation, continue to reflect issues of major importance and illustrate the value of proximity - in both physical and relative terms - in the newly defined innovation plane. One of the open theoretical challenges we attempt to tackle in the initial debate provided in our paper, concerns the possible functional transformation of proximity's spatial and non-spatial dimensions within this new digital Industry 4.0 framework, as well as the critical trade-offs that have to be made between the traditional (namely proximity) and the new technologybased approach (namely Industry 4.0) for the actors' effective coordination and cooperation. Towards this direction, we study the way proximity dimensions horizontally affect the new realm posed by Industry 4.0. Finally, given that the Industry 4.0 era of innovation cooperation gives rise to new issues, that is among others, cybersecurity and enhanced cognitive capabilities, we discuss the specific weight of each proximity dimension, and identify the need for certain dimensions to be developed amongst players compared to others that seem to rather diminish their significance. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is considered a robust system dealing with attacks detection, particularly unknown attacks and anomalies. Several IDS-based algorithms have been recently inspected in the literature, among them the well-known strengthen algorithms, i.e. Genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, Epigenetic-based algorithm (EGA) is known as an improved version of GA ensuring high performance with reduced computational complexity. Its main goal is to converge within a short time towards an optimal solution by acting on genetic operators, namely mutation and crossover. In this article, we propose a new classifier based on EGA for IDS. Especially, based on a database of network traffics, EGA is applied to classify attacks. The results, performed through EGA simulation, show that the performance of the proposed technique outperforms the ones of GA classifier by obtaining a high detection rate up to 98% and a faster processing time than that of GA and other algorithms that we have compared in this article. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

In this paper, we first set up an evaluation model to identify the set of high-risk lines by investigating the relationship between FDIA and wind power uncertainty. Then, for a power system with a high wind penetration, a tri-level preventive dispatch strategy is proposed to ensure the system security even under the worst-case of FDIA. It is demonstrated that the impacts of FDIA can cause more serious security issues as the wind penetration level increases. The effectiveness of the proposed tri-level preventive dispatch strategy in mitigating the FDIA caused overloading risk is validated using the IEEE 118-bus system.

Collectively, the use of these methods and recommendations will make it possible to ensure complex cyber resilience and fault tolerance of the artificial intelligence system, namely databases (knowledge bases), the functionality of the system itself as a whole. The considered methods are based on the aspects of ensuring cyber resilience and fault tolerance of data centers or clouds as platforms for the deployment and implementation of artificial intelligence systems. Using the proposed solutions will increase the trust of artificial intelligence systems and will allow them to be implemented more intensively in many industries.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to motivate young people to choose education and careers in cybersecurity, but also to increase competencies among both students and professionals. At the same time, many of the topics of cybersecurity are well suited for gamification: This is the case for both technical topics, where Capture The Flag competitions have gained wide recognition, but also for the less technical topics such as incident-response. There are already several well-established platforms to support the former, but in most cases, the exercises offered are quite simple (find a flag and get points), and as such do not reflect the complexity of systems to attack/protect, and if more complex scenarios are covered these often are static, and it requires a significant amount of work to create new scenarios. This paper presents the overall architecture of a new platform, designed for user-friendly and automated generation of complex gaming scenarios for learning about cybersecurity. This makes it possible to create very realistic scenarios for training both technical skills and the participants' abilities to act and make decisions in stressful situations. Moreover, it offers the possibility for users to interact with each other, both within and between teams, raising their abilities to communicate and solve challenges. The platform is envisioned with both technical perspectives and game design for learning in mind. This means that the platform is not only able to create realistic virtual labs, but the labs are created based on game scenarios that are considering specific learning objectives. This also makes it possible to create games that go beyond the traditional ""point collection"" and engage the users in a setting that feels more realistic and absorbing. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

Usually, most of existing black-box adversarial attacks show extremely low transferability while encountering powerful defense models. In this paper, based on the observed invariant property of convolutional neural networks (i.e., the models could maintain accuracy to transformed images), we propose two new methods to improve the transferability which are called as the flip-invariant attack method (FIM) and the brightness-invariant attack method (BIM), respectively. Both the novel approaches derive multiple different logit outputs by inputting the transformed copies of the original image into the white-box model. Simultaneously, the ensemble of these outputs is attacked to avoid overfitting the white-box model and generating more transferable adversarial examples. Moreover, the newly-proposed FIM and BIM methods can be naturally combined with other gradient-based methods. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset prove that our methods achieve higher attack success rate and higher transferability than previous gradient-based attack methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096529760

The urgency of the issues under consideration is justified by the need to use the Educational Data Mining (EDM) system in higher education institutions, which is caused by the contradictions between the contemporary demands of the journalism labour market and the professional training of graduates. In this regard, the proposed study is aimed at finding possible causes for existing contradictions. Based on the results of the study of educational documents and the review of the scientific literature, authors identified the 23 information computer technologies skills that are required for journalists to perform professional tasks. The students of the first year of study (N=207) of three universities were asked to evaluate the importance/necessity of these ICT skills. The used in the survey questionnaire, that consist of demographic and Likert-type questions, provided an opportunity to rank the importance of assessed skills and to identify through factor analysis four significant groups of ICJ-components. They are web publishing skills, cybersecurity skills, multimedia content preparation skills, and media promotion tools. Authors compared the results of the first-year students' survey with the results of the analysis of educational programs in the speciality 061 “Journalism” (of Ukrainian universities) and identified the directions of possible improvement of the organizational component of journalistic education. The conclusions justify the using of illuminated research methodology to develop a system of analysis of educational perception data and propose prospective directions for further research.

Critical infrastructures (CI) need principal new effective methods and means for cybersecurity ensuring. In the situation with limited resources, CI objects defining and ranking is an important task. To rank objectively, CI objects should be assessed using some criteria. Previously, authors have proposed a FMECA-based method to assess importance level for state critical information infrastructure, which allows ranking and evaluating the importance of CI objects using both quantitative and qualitative parameters.

Our core objective is to study whether firms improve their security when they become aware of their vulnerabilities and such information is publicized. To achieve this goal, we conduct a randomized field experiment on 1,262 firms in six Pan-Asian countries and regions. For the treatment group of 631 firms, we alert them of their security vulnerability index and ranking over time, and their relative performance compared to their peers via emails and a public advisory website. Compared with the control group without being informed of their security vulnerability index, the treatment group improved their security over time, with a significant reduction of outgoing spam volume. A marginally significant improvement in reducing phishing hosting websites is also observed among non-web hosting firms in the treatment group. The security improvement may be attributed to firms' proactive reaction to the security vulnerability information. Our study provides cybersecurity policy makers with useful insights on how to motivate firms to adopt better security measures. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

An insider threat is generally defined as a threat to a network or computer system that originates from a person with authorized access who misuses that access to compromise information, disrupt operations or cause physical harm, thus negatively impacting an organization. Insider threats are influenced by a combination of technical, behavioural and organizational issues. Information loss on account of insiders remains among the greatest threats to organizations, since data is now viewed as an important corporate asset. Insider threats not adequately addressed can cause harm to organizations. In this paper, a Data Leak Prevention (DLP) management workflow for mitigating insider threats is proposed. The workflow, derived from an internal CSIRT, describes practices and measures that are currently being implemented by CyberSecurity Malaysia to prevent the illicit transfer of confidential or sensitive information or data outside the corporate network. This paper provides a case study of how CyberSecurity Malaysia identifies and detects either intentional or unintentional insider data leakage incidents with focus on e-mail messages and social media applications, and how these incidents are managed according to the defined incident management process. This paper also highlights the ways in which the Information Security Management System (ISMS) has assisted CyberSecurity Malaysia with implementing the DLP workflow by incorporating the ISMS requirements. Comprehensive DLP policies and procedures ensure that all employees conform, thus speeding up the implementation process effectively. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

Repetitive nature and recognisable signatures of attacks raise demand for effective information sharing. Timely warnings about cyber incidents in other systems make it possible to identify related attacks locally. International cyber community supports several commercial and open-source threat information sharing platforms. Efficient use of these systems depends both on the quality of submitted information and the ability of the security specialist to receive, interpret, and integrate indicators of compromise into local defence systems. Business stakeholders tend to emphasise the importance of threat hunters, while the information-sharing aspect is overlooked. Therefore, there is a need for professionals who can assess risk levels of cyber incidents in a broad context and share concise information with team members, superiors, relevant institutions, and community. The complex nature of cyber attacks raised the popularity of live cyber defence exercises (CDX), where cybersecurity specialists are trained using simulated real-life scenarios. However, the exercises are mostly oriented towards the development of technical competences. This paper addresses the problem of proper development of information sharing competence during the CDX. We performed a case study of two annual international CDX. Research data were collected using several techniques. First, the participants filled in pre-event and post-event questionnaires. Additionally, each defending team was continuously observed by a dedicated evaluation team member. Finally, incident reports in short and long forms were gathered. We distinguished challenges related to internal team collaboration, information sharing among the teams, and reporting to relevant authorities. Based on the findings, we present a methodology to integrate information sharing into the planning and execution of CDX. The methodology encompasses activities, scoring strategies, scenario recommendations, tools, and communication-encouragement components. The presented enhancement creates an observable added value to the CDX training event. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

Research demonstrates some critical features in home health care and wearable technology adoption by older adults such as wearability, device appearance, display and interaction, the modeling and technical aspects of data measurement and presentation, with more sophisticated, personalized interaction systems and data analysis expected over time. The design and development of home health care technologies are often led by the requirements of their social and caregiving environments rather than the needs and preferences of older adult users. The mismatch between functionalities, intrinsic motivations and expected benefits has a detrimental impact on user acceptance. User acceptance is critical for technology to be integrated within daily living especially in areas such as IoTs and wearables. Cybersecurity is an essential part of a safe, effective and reliable healthcare delivery system. Security and privacy challenges can be overcome by implementing best practices to safeguard systems and devices. There are significant privacy risks associated with wearables and home IoTs. The literature review has identified emerging issues that underscore the need to develop a set of guidelines for conducting HCI and human factors research based on an understanding of older adults’ perceptions and preferences about data privacy and security.

Despite the huge demand and production rate, the majority of the stakeholders consist of small and medium enterprise company, especially at the plantation site. Due to this, revolution of industry 4.0 in palm oil industry, especially the upstream process is a very challenging issue. Stakeholders are reluctant to move toward the new technology due to the lack of understanding of the potential features and advantages, as well as hesitate to invest in new technology. This paper proposed a novel mathematical model to evaluate potential Industry Revolution 4.0 features based on existing technologies and optimised implementation strategy for each stakeholder. Each potential feature was evaluated based on its potential impact, estimated investment cost and non-implement penalty cost. The model covers a long-term operation to consider the inflation rate and dynamic maturity of each feature. A case study focusing on cybersecurity features is discussed and the result shows that only 7 out of 16 features that are feasible to implement in oil palm industry, where blockchain and smart contract are the most promising features to be implemented.

In order to address this need and bridge the awareness gap, we propose a method to train and evaluate the cybersecurity skills of participants in cyber ranges based on cyber-risk models. Our method consists of five steps: create cyber-risk model, identify risk treatments, setup training scenario, run training scenario, and evaluate the performance of participants. The target users of our method are the White Team and Green Team who typically design and execute training scenarios in cyber ranges. The output of our method, however, is an evaluation report for the Blue Team and Red Team participants being trained in the cyber range. We have applied our method in three large scale pilots from academia, transport, and energy. Our initial results indicate that the method is easy to use and comprehensible for training scenario developers (White/Green Team), develops cyber-risk models that facilitate real-time evaluation of participants in training scenarios, and produces useful feedback to the participants (Blue/Red Team) in terms of strengths and weaknesses regarding cybersecurity skills.

Hoaxers propagate such messages to mislead users and to promote violence. Several approaches exist in literature to address this issue. They are mainly limited to detect hoax activities by characterizing the message nature and detecting provenance of messages. However, unless hoaxes are detected, they continue to propagate across social media nodes. This work aims at reducing the dissemination of hoaxes across group of users. Relying on social graph structure, this research develops a mechanism based on smart contract logics to prevent a group to consume a fake post. To achieve this objective, we used a smart contract to exploit a trust index computed based on message characteristics and group features such as graph density, group status, group degree, group acceptability. Based on the value of trust index, the message is forwarded or blocked. Experiments realized on groups of different characteristics revealed that the proposed smart contract is even able to reactively block a fake post of the same nature than the group type. Results indicate that the proportion of targeted groups could be reduced even if their interests match with the message subject. This research is an important step forward to anti-promote hoaxes with the novelty of exploiting smart contract approach to contain their propagation. © 2020 The Authors",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091711055

To better understand the upcoming threat, in this manuscript, we investigate the design and mitigation of such malware. Accordingly, we introduce X-sWarm, which will be the next generation of resilient, stealthy malware that leverages the intelligent technique and the darknet infrastructures. Furthermore, we show that with the self-healing network mechanism, X-sWarm can achieve a low diameter and a low degree and be robust to partitioning under node removal. More importantly, we suggest the mitigation technique that neutralizes the nodes of the proposed worm. © 2020, Brno University of Technology.

For successful protection of the attacks, selection of suitable crypto algorithms and optimized implementations are required pertaining to the applications and attack types. To effectively utilize the advantages of the existing cryptographic mechanisms, various methods have been proposed for enhanced performance and better security. Cryptosystem implementations for high performance and constrained environments must be different as these platforms differ in terms of resource, performance, and security requirements. If the application incorporates both platforms for sensitive information exchange like healthcare IoT, a cryptosystem fulfilling the specific requirements of each platform and providing end-to-end security is needed. It is challenging to implement a cryptosystem which simultaneously meets the requirements of both environments using the same cryptosystem. In this chapter, efficient FPGA-based integrated cryptosystems are proposed for the security of high-performance platforms, constrained devices, and secure information exchange between them focusing on the security of healthcare IoT to address the challenges. Fewer number of algorithms are used achieving better throughput and smaller area in accordance with the specific implementations while saving extra space, key management, and key storage requirements compared to existing reported outcomes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090529275

As a technological giant operating under its own distinct governing ideology, the ramifications of China’s digital policies and use of surveillance tools are subject to great scrutiny. In its advertised pursuit of long-term stability, the Chinese government looks not just to the future but also to the past, building upon Confucian notions of harmony, legitimacy, and social hierarchy to inform contemporary technology applications and foster acceptance towards them. China is not the only Confucian-influenced society, and the counterfactuals provided by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore demonstrate Confucianism, as a cultural values system does not institute unanimous approaches to digital governance. Thus, rather than explicitly precipitating modern digital policy, we argue Confucianism instead guides and informs the implementation and justification of the current system of digital governance in a politico-cultural continuum. To demonstrate the intersectionality between Confucianism as a cultural values system and the Chinese Communist Party as an authoritarian governance system, we present the Cybersecurity Law and Social Credit System as exemplar digital tools applied by the Chinese government to efficiently maintain stability and control by establishing a unique contract with citizens regarding their right to privacy. The ethicality of China’s digital governance strategy relies critically on the ethical notions posed by a Confucian philosophical system. Viewing technology policy through a politico-cultural lens informs an understanding as to why the ethics of China’s digital endeavors, which may present a conundrum beyond its borders, find justification within them. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089579742

Smart grids are the result of a long process of transformation that power systems have been through, relying on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to improve their monitoring and control. Although an objective of this convergence of power systems and ICT is to increase their reliability, the dependency on information technology has brought new cybersecurity vulnerabilities to this scenario. Therefore, developing new cybersecurity measures for smart grids is a key factor in their success. One of these measures is attack detection, which allows the timely mitigation of attacks with the aim of limiting possible damages to the targets. As machine learning algorithms have been widely applied as powerful tools to support the design of cybersecurity solutions in multiple areas, they also have huge potential for addressing the new challenges that smart grids pose. With this as the foundational perspective, this study starts by presenting an overview of smart grids, followed by possible attacks. After this discussion, we examine the background concepts for attack detection and machine learning. Then, we discuss the existing solutions, showing in detail how they address the particularities of smart grids and their attack types using machine learning algorithms. This is supplemented by a discussion of the open issues in the use of machine learning for smart grid attack detection, followed by some future research directions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089321105

Addressing challenges of big data in intrusion detection is one issue faced the researchers and developers due to dimensionality reduction in network data. In this paper, hybrid model is proposed to handle the dimensionality reduction in intrusion detection system. The genetic algorithm was applied as preprocessing steps for selecting most significant features from entire big network dataset. The genetic algorithm was applied to generate subset of relevant features from network data set for handling dimensionality reduction. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was processed the relevant features for detecting intrusion. The NSL-KDD standard data was considered to test the performance of the hybrid model.

Since there have been few acceptance studies in the field of AR, it was particularly important to identify the factors that affect user acceptance of AR technology. This paper aims to identify whether gamification features influence users’ acceptance of the CybAR app and increase their cybersecurity awareness. The predictors of CybAR app usage were derived from the extended unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT2) with the addition of the gamification factor. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a study addressing the impact of gamification features on acceptance of the CybAR game.

Efficient preparation through cybersecurity games has become an invaluable tool to better prepare strategy and response to cyber incidents. Such games offer the potential for capacity building of decision-makers through a controlled environment, often presenting hypothetical scenarios that are designed to invoke discussion, while decision-making skills are put to the test. While games are acknowledged to be an effective method for such situations, many rely on technical capabilities to address these challenges. However, a key challenge is to understand the factors that influence cybersecurity decision-making. Further, game effectiveness for developing these skills is often not validated. This paper surveys cybersecurity games and compiles a data-set of 46 games to investigate how effective cybersecurity games are for assessing decision-making skills, and determines the state-of-the-art game. Through critical review and analysis of the data-set, a criteria to assess games for decision-making skills is presented.

Cybercrime is considered as possibly the greatest threat to connected systems worldwide, and therefore there exists a large drive in engineering to include cybersecurity in the design, development and maintenance of smart cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, the cybersecurity space was considered the responsibility of Information Technology (IT) professionals, where the greater IT infrastructure was required to keep these engineering systems safe. However, through the evolution of engineering and control systems, the IT infrastructure has started to become more integrated with these systems, improving the efficiency of the systems, but also making them more susceptible to cyber-attacks. These changes mean that securing these systems cannot remain the sole responsibility of the IT professionals, as systems must be designed with cybersecurity in mind. Considering that engineers are designing and developing more integrated systems, there exists a knowledge gap in the field of cybersecurity engineering and engineers' understanding of their cybersecurity responsibilities.

We argue that dominance in modern warfare is enabled by human and technological intelligence that uncovers the rivals’ capabilities and intentions, increases the effectiveness of the country’s own weapon systems, and facilitates the development of high-quality defense systems. Hence, gathering and evaluating intelligence is essential for countries involved in conflict or exposed to terror threats. We focus here on the strategic and tactical implications of intelligence in the context of an arms and intelligence race between two rivals. We present and assess models that show how security agencies in countries in a state of conflict (with other countries and/or non-country entities) should invest in developing their own intelligence capabilities to ensure adequate military (security) capabilities, national security, and welfare. Since advanced cyber attackers can infiltrate almost all complex computer networks to gather intelligence (and/or cause other harms), we show how countries can establish procedures and determine the budgets to optimally allocate cyber-defense resources to prevent harmful cyber-attacks on the complex computer networks that manage their infrastructure, business, security, and government operations. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088259760

Recently, network embedding has proven an important approach to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks. Most of the existing approaches only focus on topological information without embedding rich nodal information due to the lack of an effective mechanism to capture the interaction between two different information modalities. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel deep attributed network embedding framework named DeepAD to differentiate anomalies whose behaviors obviously deviate from the majority. DeepAD (i) simultaneously capture both of the highly non-linear topological structure and node attributes information based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) and (ii) preserve various interaction proximities between two different information modalities to make them complement each other towards a unified representation for anomaly detection.

The main goal of this paper is to check how secure the power SCADA System is? In SCADA systems, attackers either disable the system or attempt to damage the SCADA network by pushing out improper data or commands for disrupting communications. SCADA systems are most vulnerable to malicious attackers due to their interconnectivity in smart grids and usage of standard plain text protocols. In SCADA systems due to legacy communication infrastructure and protocols, they have cybersecurity vulnerabilities because systems were initially designed with less cyber threat consideration. This paper analyses the possibility of conducting Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on SCADA communication, which uses an International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 60870-5-104) SCADA communication protocol standard. The Packet Inspection method on SCADA systems is used for detection of MITM attacks conducted based on ARP Poisoning method. SCADA communication networks are used to control various infrastructures and play vital roles for utility companies and the process industries including the power sector, gas, oil, water, etc. This paper is used to analyze security threats in Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)-control center communication using packet sniffing on IEC-60870-5-104 standard compliance SCADA communications and by conducting MITM attacks on it. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088209694

Autonomous vehicles handle large amounts of data and can connect to more and more existing devices, smartphones, tablets, or even other cars and systems. This poses the risk of unauthorized access to data. Theoretically cars have separate computer units, operate in isolation, and are not connected, so there is less possibility to be attacked. However if the vehicles are interconnected, hackers can have easier access to personal data. They can get information about the location of the car owner, their typical trips, and, for example, allow an intruder to know when the tracked person is not at home. Furthermore it can also be happened that the vehicle operation is maliciously disturbed, which can result in a security risk for the passengers. In extreme cases, computer terrorist attacks can also be prepared - large-scale interventions on roads can lead to chaos across a region or country.

Given a set of potential threats and a set of available countermeasures, the decision maker needs to decide which countermeasure to implement under limited budget to minimize potential losses from successful cyber-attacks and mitigate the impact of disruptions caused by IT security incidents. The selection of countermeasures is based on their effectiveness of blocking different threats, implementation costs and probability of potential attack scenarios. The problem is formulated as a single- or bi-objective stochastic mixed integer program and a conditional value-at-risk approach combined with scenario-based analysis is applied to control the risk of high losses due to operational disruptions and optimize worst-case performance of an IT system. The bi-objective trade-off model provides the decision maker with a simple tool for balancing expected and worst-case losses and for shaping of the resulting cost distribution through the selection of optimal subset of countermeasures for implementation, i.e., the selection of optimal countermeasure portfolio. The selected portfolio explicitly depends on preferred confidence level and cost/risk preference of the decision maker. Numerical examples are presented and some computational results are reported to compare the risk-averse solutions that minimize conditional value-at-risk with the risk-neutral ones that minimize expected cost.

In addition, modern malwares use advanced obfuscation techniques such as polymorphism to avoid detection and continue the exploitation of user privacy. As a result, accurate and timely detection of malware is an urgent issue in the cybersecurity field. Existing hardware-based solutions have applied machine learning algorithms to distinguish between malicious and benign applications based on the readings from hardware performance counters (HPCs), and have accomplished high accuracy rates for malware detection. However, there are physical limitations for processors currently available in the market that cannot be ignored; such as, the number of HPCs available simultaneously. Also, due to the astronomical costs and complexity associated with malware annually, proposed HPC solutions require improvement in terms of real-time processing and intelligent learning model. Multiple representations of the hardware events as feature inputs need to be thoroughly investigated; in addition to, architectural optimization for the existing deep learning models. In this paper, we use the sum of total HPC accesses over a sampling interval and 28 × 28 × 1 images of the same sampling window as two representations of low-level processor behavioral events for input features. Through comprehensive feature selection analysis, we show that malware can be separated from benign applications with the sum of HPC accesses and the images using only five HPCs.

We model traffic signal tampering as a bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously seeks to reduce vehicular throughput in the network over time (maximize impact) while introducing minimal changes to network signal timings (minimize noticeability). We represent the Spatio-temporal traffic dynamics as a static network flow problem on a time-expanded graph. This allows us to reduce the (non-convex) attack problem to a tractable form, which can be solved using traditional techniques used to solve linear network programming problems. We show that minor but objective adjustments in the signal timings over time can severely impact traffic conditions at the network level. We investigate network vulnerability by examining the concavity of the Pareto-optimal frontier obtained by solving the bi-objective attack problem. Numerical experiments are carried to illustrate the types of insights that can be extracted from the Pareto-optimal frontier. For instance, our experiments suggest that the vulnerability of a traffic network to signal tampering is independent of the demand levels. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085255540

This work requires both automated tools that detect and prevent attacks, and data presentation tools that can present pertinent network security monitoring information to practitioners in an efficient and comprehensible manner. In recent years, advances have been made in the development of visual approaches to data presentation, with some uptake of advanced security visualization tools in SOCs. Sonification in which data are represented as sound, is said to have potential as an approach that could work alongside existing visual data presentation approaches to address some of the unique challenges faced by SOCs. For example, sonification has been shown to enable peripheral monitoring of processes, which could aid practitioners multitasking in busy SOCs. The perspectives of security practitioners on incorporating sonification into their actual working environments have not yet been examined, however. The aim of this article, therefore, is to address this gap by exploring attitudes to using sonification in SOCs and by identifying the data presentation approaches currently used. We report on the results of a study consisting of an online survey (N = 20) and interviews (N = 21) with security practitioners working in a range of different SOCs. Our contributions are (i) a refined appreciation of the contexts in which sonification could aid in SOC working practice, (ii) an understanding of the areas in which sonification may not be beneficial or may even be problematic, (iii) an analysis of the critical requirements for the design of sonification systems and their integration into the SOC setting and (iv) evidence of the visual data presentation techniques currently used and identification of how sonification might work alongside and address challenges to using them. Our findings clarify insights into the potential benefits and challenges of introducing sonification to support work in this vital security monitoring environment. Participants saw potential value in using sonification systems to aid in anomaly detection tasks in SOCs (such as retrospective hunting), as well as in situations in which peripheral monitoring is desirable: while multitasking with multiple work tasks, or while outside of the SOC. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Thus, similarities may exist between OSN and word-processed texts. Moreover, none of the studies to date have made a detailed comparison of the writing styles across multidisciplinary factors. This paper attempts to close the gap between the writing styles in pre- and post-Internet periods as well as provide an in-depth comparison of the writing styles in OSN texts across three major factors: demographics, personality behavior, and cybersecurity.

CPS is concerned with physical entities that are controlled by computational elements. The field is relatively new, emerging, and also somewhat fragmented in development. There are multiple agencies, entities, and activities being undertaken to address a nexus of emerging issues (e.g., cybersecurity) in critical infrastructures. However, the development of critical CPS, as a field, albeit with good intentions and efforts, appears to be largely 'self-organizing.' In response, we suggest CSG as an organizing construct capable of provided a greater degree of cohesion - in essence suggesting that CPS field development as a 'purposeful system' within the CSG construct. CSG is taken as a means to provide for design, execution, and evolution of 'metasystem' functions necessary to provide for communication, control, and coordination, and integration in critical CPS. First, we introduce critical CPS, emphasizing current domination of self-organization as the driving force in developing viable CPS. Second, we introduce CSG as a construct that can introduce more purposeful organization to the emerging field with the potential to accelerate and integrate development. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

Detecting a breach is extremely difficult and this is confirmed by the findings of studies related to cyber-attacks on organizations. A study conducted last year by IBM found that it takes 206 days on average to US companies to detect a data breach. As a consequence, the effectiveness of existing defensive tools is in question. In this work we deal with the detection of malicious authentication events, which are responsible for effective execution of the stealthy attack, called lateral movement. Authentication event logs produce a pure categorical feature space which creates methodological challenges for developing outlier detection algorithms. We propose an auto semi-supervised outlier ensemble detector that does not leverage the ground truth to learn the normal behavior. The automatic nature of our methodology is supported by established unsupervised outlier ensemble theory. We test the performance of our detector on a real-world cyber security dataset provided publicly by the Los Alamos National Lab. Overall, our experiments show that our proposed detector outperforms existing algorithms and produces a 0 False Negative Rate without missing any malicious login event and a False Positive Rate which improves the state-of-the-art. In addition, by detecting malicious authentication events, compared to the majority of the existing works which focus solely on detecting malicious users or computers, we are able to provide insights regarding when and at which systems malicious login events happened. Beyond the application on a public dataset we are working with our industry partner, POST Luxembourg, to employ the proposed detector on their network. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083682397

This study examined whether college students disclosed private information about themselves, and what type of information they shared. The study utilized pretexting, in which attackers impersonate individuals in certain roles and often involves extensive research to ensure credibility. The goal of pretexting is to create situations where individuals feel safe releasing information that they otherwise might not. The pretexts used for this study were based on the natural inclination to help, where people tend to want to help those in need, and reciprocity, where people tend to return favors given to them. Participants (N=51) answered survey questions that they thought were for a good cause or that would result in a reward. This survey asked for increasingly sensitive information that could be used maliciously to gain access to identification, passwords, or security questions. Upon completing the survey, participants were debriefed on the true nature of the study and were interviewed about why they were willing to share information via the survey. Some of the most commonly skipped questions included “Student ID number” and “What is your mother's maiden name?”. General themes identified from the interviews included the importance of similarities between the researcher and the subject, the researcher's adherence to the character role, the subject's awareness of question sensitivity, and the overall differences between online and offline disclosure. Findings suggest that college students are more likely to disclose private information if the attacker shares a similar trait with the target or if the attacker adheres to the character role they are impersonating. Additionally, this study sheds light on the research limitations, emphasizes the relevance of the human factor in security and privacy, and offers recommendations for future research. © 2020. the authors.

Similar to many other critical industries, healthcare faces an onslaught of daily cybersecurity challenges, however is largely at a disadvantage due to outdated and antiquated legislation. As of 2019, no legislation or regulatory body in healthcare adequately cover the needs of cybersecurity. However, regulations have forced healthcare to deploy technology at an expansive rate as well as having them deploy FDA, a regulatory body, approved medical devices from the assembly line that are inherently insecure. By looking at reported incidents, the authors will examine modifications to legislation in healthcare and the impact on cybersecurity-related events facing the organizational vertical. Legislation such as the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989 adversely impacts healthcare as cybersecurity is not considered a ""service,"" and as such, cannot be shared between two healthcare organizations. By bringing light to the inadequacies of cybersecurity in legislation and regulation of the United States healthcare system, the paper aim to bring cybersecurity to the forefront of future legislation and regulation. © Copyright 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

To see the answers, we leverage image classification as an example application scenario to propose a framework of Evaluating Deep Learning for Image Classification (EDLIC) to conduct comprehensively quantitative analysis. Moreover, we introduce a set of evaluating metrics to measure the performance of different attacking and defensive techniques. After that, we conduct extensive experiments towards the performance of deep learning for image classification under different adversarial environments to validate the scalability of EDLIC.

To maintain the availability of the control system, the availability of anomaly detection itself is important. This paper considers a third-party monitoring system with multiple anomaly detection functions. The third monitoring system devotes control systems to control operations instated of security operations. Also, when a control system is subjected to a high-level cyberattack which loses control and security functions, it is expected that the multiple detection functions allow the operator to detect the abnormality earlier. Our proposed system uses two redundant PLCs for sequence control, and one of them is for normal operation, and the other one is for anomaly detection. They operate in conjunction, and when the cyberattacked PLC deviates from the normal operation, the anomaly detection PLC turns on the LED to make it easier to recognize visually, and determines that it is an anomaly. The cyberattack detection method is that the anomaly detection PLC always holds the normal state transition information of the control PLC, and the former PLC always monitors that of the latter PLC. Only when an abnormality occurs, the former PLC detects it as an abnormality. The display method of the detection way is shown by using three types of LEDs. By LEDs turning on or off, the operator can recognize which status is abnormal. The LED lighting state is shown in the state transition diagram, and we explain the superiority of the third-party monitoring system incorporating multiple detection methods. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082621956

The approach is characterized by several layers of data processing, including extraction and decomposition of datasets, compression of feature vectors, training, and classification. To reduce the dimension of the analyzed feature vectors, principal component analysis is applied. Various binary classifiers are used for analyzing the input vector using principal component analysis: support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, Gaussian naïve Bayes, artificial neural network, and decision tree. In order to increase the precision of attack detection, it is proposed to combine these classifiers into a single weighted ensemble. This is constructed on the basis of weighted voting, soft voting, AdaBoost, and majority voting. Two different architectures of the distributed intrusion detection system based on Big Data technologies are used. In the first, parallel data processing is achieved by splitting data into several non-intersecting subsets, and a separate parallel thread is assigned to each of the formed chunks. In the second, several client-sensors and a server-collector are used, where each sensor contains several network analyzers and a balancer. The efficiency of the suggested approach for network attack and anomaly detection is experimentally evaluated using two different datasets: a dataset with Internet of Things traffic including several kinds of different classes of attacks; and a dataset with computer network traffic containing host scanning and DDoS attacks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079462576

It has earlier been shown that monitoring malicious hacker discussions about software vulnerabilities in the Dark web and Deep web platforms (D2web) is indicative of future cyberattack incidents. Based on this finding, a system generating warnings of cyberattack incidents was previously developed. However, key limitations to this approach are (1) the strong reliance on explicit software vulnerability mentions from malicious hackers, and (2) the inability to adapt to the ephemeral, constantly changing nature of D2web sites. In this chapter, we address those limitations by leveraging indicators that capture aggregate discussion trends identified from the context of hacker discussions across multiple hacker community websites. Our approach is evaluated on real-world, enterprise-targeted attack events of malicious emails. Compared to a baseline statistical prediction model, our approach provides better precision-recall tradeoff.

However, its security and privacy mechanisms are still not well-tailored and lagging behind. Massive academic and industrial surveys, researches, and studies have been conducted and implemented but the general consensus is that conventional cryptographic methods are not overly suitable for adoption in IoT environments in a straightforward manner without incurring huge operational, computational, storage, and energy costs. Therefore, an alternative is to a lightweight cryptographic method offering high levels of data and system security to mitigate such computational cost, storage capacity, and energy consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight mutual authentication and message exchange scheme between IoT devices via a publically available server based on symmetric and asymmetric hybrid cryptography. The server plays an important role to register and authenticate different IoT devices in a federated environment.

To our knowledge, we are the first to propose and study this approach. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected approximately 180 open-ended responses to several question stems from the Cybersecurity Concept Inventory of the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools Project and from the Digital Logic Concept Inventory. We generated preliminary distractors by filtering responses, grouping similar responses, selecting the four most frequent groups, and refining a representative distractor for each of these groups. We analyzed our data in two ways. First, we compared the responses and resulting distractors with those from the aforementioned inventories. Second, we obtained feedback from Amazon Mechanical Turk on the resulting new draft test items (including distractors) from additional subjects. Challenges in using crowdsourcing include controlling the selection of subjects and filtering out responses that do not reflect genuine effort. Despite these challenges, our results suggest that crowdsourcing can be a very useful tool in generating effective distractors (attractive to subjects who do not understand the targeted concept). Our results also suggest that this method is faster, easier, and cheaper than is the traditional method of having one or more experts draft distractors, building on talk-aloud interviews with subjects to uncover their misconceptions. Our results are significant because generating effective distractors is one of the most difficult steps in creating multiple-choice assessments. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076089777

Despite the dozens of technical and technological means to provide an information security, the issue of quantifying the level of information security culture (ISC) in the organization remains inadequately investigated. The personal information security culture of employee becomes the basis of organizational ISC. The model for identifying a personal ISC using the fuzzy logic for the formalized assessment of personnel ISC in the overall quantitative assessment of the organization’s IS was proposed. The need for this approach caused with difficulty of obtaining quantitative evaluation indicators of personnel ISC in assessing the overall security of the organization. As an example of using this model, the assessment of the user’s personal cybersecurity culture is considered. It was carried out by collecting the input data by questionnaire and represented as the “inputs-output” surfaces of the fuzzy hierarchical system.

Although, numerous techniques that have been applied have shown very good prospects, there are several difficulties in managing cyber-attacks from the angle of biometric recognition systems which are commonly used in cybersecurity. These challenges has positioned cybersecurity issues to be regarded as complex and uncertain which requires techniques such as information granulation to unravel a sustainable solution. This paper investigates how information granulation techniques are used in cybersecurity detection models with the aim of providing a holistic view of the current status of research in this area. In this paper, we proposed a framework that applied the principle of justifiable granularity (PJG) in the feature extraction module of a finger-vein recognition system using granular support vector machines as classifier to justify the effectiveness of information granulation in strengthening a verification system in a cybersecurity setting.

Time synchronization among the involved PMUs and other involved disturbance monitoring equipment (DME) is vital for situational awareness within the smart grid so as to avoid catastrophic failures, such as large-scale blackouts. Current PMUs often utilize Global Positioning System (GPS) substation clocks for time synchronization. From a cybersecurity vantage point, this subjects the PMUs, and in turn, the entire involved smart grid, to various cyber electromagnetic vulnerabilities, such as GPS blocking/jamming, and spoofing.

The cybersecurity industry is trying to meet today's requirements by introducing new and more advanced security technologies and methods, but it is believed that such a universal approach is not enough. The study is devoted to resolving the objective contradiction between the growing practical requirements for an appropriate level of cybersecurity of business process contours while increasing the number and technological complexity of cybersecurity threats. Also the fact that threats acquire hybrid features on the one hand, and imperfection, and sometimes the lack of methodology for modeling the behavior of interacting agents of security systems should be taken into account. However, this does not allow timely prediction of future actions of attackers, and as a result, determining the required level of investment in security, which will provide the required level of cybersecurity. The paper proposes the Concept of modeling the behavior of interacting agents, the basis of which is a three-level structure of modeling the subjects and business processes of the contours of the organization and security system, based on modeling the behavior of antagonistic agents.

With the gradual opening of industrial control network, the PubSub security model in OPC UA protocol alone cannot meet the new security requirements under the background of OT and IT integration. According to the specification, we analyze the possible threats, impacts and countermeasures that PubSub may face in OPC UA deployment environment, and emphasized that PubSub security model is difficult to protect resource-constrained industrial field equipment from the harm caused by DoS and other attacks. In view of the limited resources of industrial control network, this paper proposes that OTG gateway provides protection for PubSub service. Compared with traditional security gateway, OTG gateway can greatly reduce the consumption of industrial control network resources by network attacks. In addition, according to the characteristics of PubSub protocol, a DoS detection algorithm for this architecture is proposed. Compared with the traditional DoS detection algorithm, it has better applicability to PubSub protocol and can detect DoS attacks more accurately to reduce the impact on device performance. Experiments show that the DoS detection algorithm has 100% accuracy and 0.13% false positive rate, and can detect DoS attacks faster than the traditional detection algorithm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098962797

One major challenge in state-of-the-art IDS is that the Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) cannot be well detected. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) extract latent features of input data, which is considered to be able to capture intrinsic property of APTs, to detect APTs. However, DNN is not well used in APT detection. In this paper, a DNN model is utilized for intrusion detection and a novel method of preprocessing is proposed to improve the performance of the detection algorithms. We consider the statistical characteristics of training set to be the statistical characteristics of test set and detection set. Experiment results show that our preprocessing methodology achieves a better performance in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 Score than traditional preprocessing methods, which means a better detection for APTs. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101691823

Blacklists maintain records of previously known malicious URL reputations. These lists are however shortcoming when there is need to detect newly generated malicious URLs. For that reason, modern research has resorted to training machine learning algorithms to detect malicious URLs. In this paper, we contributed towards the detection of malicious URLs using URL based features in a multiclass classification setting. We focused on three popular URL attack types which are phishing, spam and malware. Our work can be used as a supplementary tool in new or existing anti-phishing, anti-spam and anti-malware detection platforms.

To achieve this goal, we have to develop a co-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the cybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the definition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid of cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work together efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that public interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law enforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek to resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data sharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as cybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be reconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and sharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to co-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good practices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple third-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse data. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising co-productive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common standards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon. We propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and sharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and standardised in order to mitigate the paradox. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103844912

With a wide array of public and commercial sources that distribute threat intelligence, extending intelligence collection and analysis has become indispensable in developing effective cybersecurity measures.Unstructured data like technical articles and reports are known to be difficult to analyze and formalize. While many previous research works attempt to semantically extract unstructured threat intelligence, none of them is applied for Chinese data sources. As China is both the largest source and victim of cyberattacks, lacking visibility of Chinese data sources is a major blind spot of CTI.In this paper, we present CTI ANT, the first automatic system for analyzing Chinese CTI, which enlarges the threat intelligence visibility to Chinese data sources. CTI ANT is constructed of three sub-systems: an automatic classification system (CSAC) for inspecting threat intelligence types, a recommendation system (CTRS) that identifies trending keywords to assist threat analysts, and a Web API to label MITRE ATTCK® techniques in Chinese APT reports. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed CSAC and CTRS have achieved superior performance with an average accuracy exceeding 93% and 80%, respectively.

The composition of OSs on a network allows for a better quality of device management to be achieved. Additionally, it can be used to identify devices that pose a security risk to the network. However, the sheer number and diversity of OSs that comprise modern networks have vastly increased this management complexity. We leverage insights from social networking theory to provide an encryption-invariant OS classification technique that is quick to train and widely deployable on various network configurations. In particular, we show how an affiliation graph can be used as an input to a machine learning classifier to predict the OS of a device using only the IP addresses for which the device communicates with.We examine the effectiveness of our approach through an empirical analysis of 498 devices on a university campus' wireless network. In particular, we show our methodology can classify different OS families (i.e., Apple, Windows, and Android OSs) with an accuracy of 99.3%. Furthermore, we extend this study by: 1) examining distinct OSs (e.g., iOS, OS X, and Windows 10); 2) investigating the interval of time required to make an accurate prediction; and, 3) determining the effectiveness of our approach after six months. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113746150

Many companies and governments have reported incidents related to these threats. Throughout the life cycle of an APT, one of the most commonly used techniques for gaining access is network attacks. Tools based on machine learning are effective in detecting these attacks. However, researchers usually have problems with finding suitable datasets for fitting their models. The problem is even harder when flow data are required. In this paper, we describe a framework to gather flow datasets using a NetFlow sensor. We also present the Docker-based framework for gathering netflow data (DOROTHEA), a Docker-based solution implementing the above framework. This tool aims to easily generate taggable network traffic to build suitable datasets for fitting classification models. In order to demonstrate that datasets gathered with DOROTHEA can be used for fitting classification models for malicious-traffic detection, several models were built using the model evaluator (MoEv), a general-purpose tool for training machine-learning algorithms.

In order to help cybersecurity researchers have better understandings of the threat actions taken by attackers in cybersecurity incidents, this paper proposes a method to automatically extract multiple threat actions from cybersecurity incident reports based on the conditional co-occurrence degree. Firstly, the text is reconstructed into a set of co-occurrence words. Then Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is used to extract the topic words to calculate the semantic similarity between the documents and the threat actions, which is taken as the document features. Finally, the problem of threat actions extraction is transformed into multi-label classification problem, and several machine learning algorithms are used to complete the extraction of threat actions in articles related to cybersecurity events. The dataset consists of security-related articles from various authoritative threat intelligence publishing platforms. After a series of experiments, we compared the performance of the proposed method with the previous method. The experimental results show that the precision of the threat actions extraction method proposed in this paper is over 65%.

These intelligent cyber-security solutions demand careful integration of the learning algorithms to develop a significant cyber incident detection system to formulate security analysts' industrial level. The development of advanced malware programs poses a critical threat to cybersecurity systems. Hence, an efficient, robust, and scalable malware recognition module is essential for every cybersecurity product. Conventional Signature-based methods struggle in terms of robustness and effectiveness during malware detection, specifically in the case of zero-day and polymorphic viruses attacks. In this paper, we design an adaptive Machine Learning based active malware detection framework which provides a cybersecurity solution against phishing attacks. The proposed framework utilize ML algorithms in a multilayered feed-forwarding approach to successfully detect the malware by examining the static features of the web pages. The proposed framework successfully extracts the features from the web pages and performs a successful detection process for the phishing attack. In the multilayered feed-forwarding framework, the first layer utilizes Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVN), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifiers to build a model for detecting malware from the real-time input. The output of the first layer passes to the Ensemble Voting (EV) algorithm, which accumulates earlier classifiers' performance. At the third layer, adaptive frameworks investigate second layer input data and formulate the phishing detection model. We analyze the proposed framework's performance on three different phishing datasets and validate the higher accuracy rate. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104652853

To select the most representative samples and the minority class samples in the network traffic streams, the novel hybrid active learning labeling strategy based on predicted uncertainty and class imbalance ratio is proposed, which uses margin value as criterion and decision threshold based on the class imbalance ratio. To make full use of the labeled samples, a samples training weight adjustment mechanism is designed to enhance the performance of the ensemble classifier. Moreover, the drift detection mechanism is also integrated into the ensemble classifier to detect possible drift in the traffic stream and evolve the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a good protocol identification ability especially on the minority class protocols. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104388030

Our workflow combines deep learning, combinatorial optimization, heuristics and machine learning. A combination of heuristics and deep learning is used to embed function (and method) labels into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Because the corpus of the Fluoride source code is rather limited (containing approximately 12,000 functions), a straightforward embedding (using, e.g. code2vec) is untenable. To overcome the challenge of dearth of data, it is necessary to go through an intermediate step of Byte-Pair Encoding. Subsequently, we embed the tokens from which we assemble an embedding of function/method labels. Long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to embed tokens. The next step is to form a distance matrix consisting of the cosines between every pairs of vectors (function embedding) which in turn is interpreted as a (combinatorial) graph whose vertices represent functions, and edges correspond to entries whose value exceed some given threshold. Cluster-Editing is then applied to partition the vertex set of the graph into subsets representing ""dense graphs,""that are nearly complete subgraphs. Finally, the vectors representing the components, plus additional heuristic-based features are used as features to model the components for vulnerability risk. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103935109

Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors to understand their operating environment. Active sensors such as camera, LiDAR, ultrasonic, and radar are vulnerable to physical channel attacks. One way to counter these attacks is to pattern match the sensor data with its own unique physical distortions, commonly referred to as a fingerprint. This fingerprint exists because of how the sensor was manufactured, and it can be used to determine the transmitting sensor from the received waveform. In this paper, using an ultrasonic sensor, we establish that there exists a specific distortion profile in the transmitted waveform called physical fingerprint that can be attributed to their intrinsic characteristics. We propose a joint time-frequency analysis-based framework for ultrasonic sensor fingerprint extraction and use it as a feature to train a Naive Bayes classifier. The trained model is used for transmitter identification from the received physical waveform. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102268754

For ensuring privacy and protection of healthcare data, access control is regarded as one of the first-line-of-defense mechanisms. As none of the traditional enterprise access control models can completely cater to the need of the healthcare domain which includes a myriad of contexts, in this paper, we present a context-policy-based access control scheme. Our scheme relies on the eTRON cybersecurity architecture for tamper-resistance and cryptographic functions, and leverages a context-specific blend of classical discretionary and role-based access models for incorporation into legacy systems. Moreover, our scheme adheres to key recommendations of prominent statutory and technical guidelines including HIPAA and HL7.

Many certification schemes, such as Common Criteria and FIPS 140, continue without addressing side-channel flaws. Research works mostly tackle sophisticated attacks with simple use-cases, which is not the reality where end-to-end evaluation is not trivial. In this study we used all due diligence to assess the invulnerability of a given implementation from the shoes of an evaluator. In this work we underline that there are two kinds of SCA: horizontal and vertical. In terms of quotation, measurement and exploitation, horizontal SCA is easier. If traces are constant-time, then vertical attacks become convenient, since there is no need for specific alignment (“value based analysis”). We introduce our new methodology: Vary the key to select sensitive samples, where the values depend upon the key, and subsequently vary the mask to uncover unmasked key-dependent leakage, i.e., the flaws. This can be done in the source code (pre-silicon) for the designer or on the actual traces (post-silicon) for the test-lab. We also propose a methodology for quotations regarding SCA unlike standards that focus on only one aspect (like number of traces) and forgets about other aspects (such as equipment; cf.

Although the cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud, there are still many security concerns due to inherently complex model the cloud providers operate on (e.g., multi-tenancy). In addition, the enterprises whose services have migrated into the cloud have a preference for their own cybersecurity situation awareness capability on top of the security mechanisms provided by the cloud providers. In this way, the enterprises can monitor the performance of the security offerings of the cloud and have a choice to decide and select potential response strategies more appropriate to the enterprise in the presence of the attack where the defense provided by the cloud doesn't work for them. However, some response strategies, such as Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques shown to be effective to secure cloud, cannot be deployed by the enterprise themselves.

However, cyber attacks against ICS - especially at the communication channels between human-machine interface (HMIs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) - are increasing at a rate which outstrips the rate of mitigation. In this paper, we introduce a vendor-agnostic analytics framework which allows security researchers to analyse attacks against ICS systems, even if the researchers have zero control automation domain knowledge or are faced with a myriad of heterogenous ICS systems. Unlike existing works that require expertise in domain knowledge and specialised tool usage, our analytics framework does not require prior knowledge about ICS communication protocols, PLCs, and expertise of any network penetration testing tool. Using 'digital twin' scenarios comprising industry-representative HMIs, PLCs and firewalls in our test lab, our framework's steps were demonstrated to successfully implement a stealthy deception attack based on false data injection attacks (FDIA). Furthermore, our framework also demonstrated the relative ease of attack dataset collection, and the ability to leverage well-known penetration testing tools. We also introduce the concept of 'heuristic inference attacks', a new family of attack types on ICS which is agnostic to PLC and HMI brands/models commonly deployed in ICS.

A system to determine whether activities that occur are from the same user or not facilitates forensic analysis as well as the detection of concurrent attacks from different devices by the same user. This paper proposes a system for identifying attackers based on behaviors expressed via their use of the Bash command line interface, the most common shell on Linux distributions. Prior systems were limited by issues such as requiring labeled user data which is difficult to acquire or not being specific enough to monitor individual persons. The approach proposed herein does not require labeled data and is specific enough to target individual users. The proposed system analyzes the level of variance between commands used and calculates an anomaly score for each given command. It uses these anomaly scores to compare Bash history sets together to identify if they were created by the same user. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101235266

New and mutated malware are appearing with increasing frequency in recent years. In the real-world scenario, new families of malware are often discovered in the cybersecurity protection system. In order to improve the protection capability of the system, it is necessary to add the newly discovered malware identification characteristics to the online system. However, the samples of newly discovered malware families are usually too small to effectively extract the characteristics of new classes, resulting in a low recognition rate of new families. The essence of this problem is a multi-classification problem based on imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we propose a self-attention based malware classification method to solve the malware classification on imbalanced datasets. An open source dataset is used to simulate the classification of malware on balanced and imbalanced datasets.

When creating digital platforms, a number of difficulties arise: the large size of the digital infrastructure and its heterogeneity, poorly established information interaction between segments, the lack of a unified approach to ensuring cybersecurity and a high dependence on the qualifications of personnel and equipment reliability. The introduction of the digital economy leads to an increase in the risk of cyber threats associated with access control problems between information flow regulation and control systems.

Organizations not only have to update their software to the latest versions, but do effective patch management and prioritize security-related patching as well. In addition to intelligence sources such as Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) alerts, cybersecurity news, national vulnerability database (NBD), and commercial cybersecurity vendors, social media is another valuable source that facilitates early stage intelligence gathering. To early detect future cyber threats based on publicly available resources on the Internet, we propose a dynamic vulnerability-threat assessment model to predict the tendency to be exploited for vulnerability entries listed in Common Vulnerability Exposures, and also to analyze social media contents such as Twitter to extract meaningful information. The model takes multiple aspects of vulnerabilities gathered from different sources into consideration. Features range from profile information to contextual information about these vulnerabilities. For the social media data, this study leverages machine learning techniques specially for Twitter which helps to filter out non-cybersecurity-related tweets and also label the topic categories of each tweet. When applied to predict the vulnerabilities exploitation and analyzed the real-world social media discussion data, it showed promising prediction accuracy with purified social media intelligence.

As there are uncertain elements to this and as we model uncertainty using probability, we seek to estimate the attack loss distribution. In particular, the tail of the distribution represents the lowprobability but high-impact events. However, quantifying those events using standard Monte Carlo techniques is inefficient due to the low probability. This paper proposes a novel cybersecurity risk assessment approach based on uncertain graphs, with an emphasis on modeling losses due to cyber-attacks. Under rare event realizations where the attack loss is greater than a selected threshold, we (i) derive the analytically optimal importance sampling scheme for the loss tail probability and (ii) propose an approximation to the optimal importance sampling scheme which has the assurance of bounded relative error. While the approximation scheme requires solving an NP-hard problem, we use a search procedure that becomes more efficient as the attack loss threshold increases.

Instead of accepting the risk of no security, alternatives are possible which achieve both security outcomes and conservation of time. We explore the paradigm of invisible security focused on creating cyber defenses that occur automatically without end user intervention. Invisible security is the next evolutionary step to aid users, now that automation is robust and effective in supporting it. Even though some example implementations, such as automatic updates, have existed for years, dedicated focus on this emerging paradigm is required to develop, measure, and deploy new capabilities. We present examples consistent with this approach in existence today, including automatic software updates and protective DNS.

Although numerous organizations have implemented a wide variety of information technology (IT) systems in recent years, the number of cybersecurity incidents demanding rapid and efficient responses continues to increase. Furthermore, while it is desirable for organizations to set appropriate target levels when addressing such risks, the process is difficult because managers are seldom information security specialists. In such situations, management typically sets goals regarding information security, communicates risk factors with the information department, and then provides decision support for concrete measures. However, the fact that they are not security experts often makes it difficult to implement these measures. As a partial countermeasure to such cases, we believe that an approach by which an organization can gain an understanding of similar situations in other organizations, understand and adjust the methods by which they approach related issues, and then adapt those methods to their own use can be effective. However, a primary concern regarding information sharing between organizations is that while one organization may desire to know the status of other organizations, they do not want necessarily want to share similar information related to their own organizations. As a result, active efforts to facilitate such sharing have seen little progress. In this paper, we report on the development of a system that visualizes cyber-risks related to a particular organization, shows similar results for other organizations in the form of average values within a range that allows k-anonymity to be maintained, and then makes comparisons among those results. This makes it difficult for other participating organizations to gain a specific understanding of conditions within a specific organization. We then developed a prototype system using LimeSurvey, which is an easily modifiable open source web application, in order to make our proposed system easy to customize and use. Our experimental results show that this prototype enables comparisons to be made regarding situations among various participating organizations in the same industries while maintaining the anonymity of each individual organization. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099343250

The system uses Ethernet as the interface for the external controller and the gateway, and CAN as the interface for the communication between the internal controllers. Vehicle gateway provides an interface for exchanging vehicle data and connecting in real time in a heterogeneous communication environment between the existing CAN network protocol and the external Ethernet protocol. In this routing operation, time delay occurs, and in the in-vehicle network environment where communication time is important, this delay time must be considered and measured during the development process. Since the involvement of the external communication network causes a security vulnerability, a security function that guarantees the integrity of the message against cybersecurity risks should be considered. In this paper, we investigate the effects of delayed gateway routing on CAN frames and Ethernet frames, including security systems. For the above investigation, quantitative comparison and analysis are performed by using two routing methods: direct routing method without data modification when routing from CAN frame to Ethernet frame, and indirect routing method for selecting and transmitting the necessary data. For security, CMAC is used in order to ensure the integrity of the CAN network messages and Ethernet messages. Generation and verification of the CMAC uses the hardware security module(HSM) that is built into the Infineon 32-bit MCU, TC397.

Injection of manipulated radio messages into traffic can cause severe accidents in the foreseeable future, and can currently be achieved without having to manipulate on-board vehicle systems directly, for example by hijacking cellphones instead and using these as senders. Thereby, large-scale attacks on vehicles can be executed remotely, and target relatively vulnerable devices. To mitigate remaining vulnerabilities in current automotive security architectures, this paper proposes a secondary communication channel using vehicle head and taillights. In contrast to existing approaches, this method allows both to achieve a sufficient data rate and to extract the angular position of the sender, by means of an imaging process which only requires close-to-market, cost-efficient technology. Through this, injecting false messages by masquerading as a different sender is considerably more challenging: The receiver can verify a message’s source position with the supposed position of the sender, e.g. by using onboard sensors or communicated information. Thereby, reliably faking both the communicated messages and the position of the sender will require direct manipulation of on-board vehicle systems, raising the security level of the function accordingly, and precluding low-threshold, wide-range attacks. © 2020 De Gruyter.

Human actions, when related to cyber-based corporate espionage, cannot be described through rudimentary factors supporting causation for “betrayal” and the motivation to compromise proprietary technology and economic information belonging to a business entrusting its secrets with an employee. The underlying issue is about how to identify a potential actor willing to compromise their “integrity” in exchange for personal gain or personal interest even when the penalty will be far greater than the reward.

Previous instances of malicious remote control of implantable medical devices, including insulin delivery pumps and implantable cardiac defibrillators, have been documented. Though no cases of neuromodulatory hacking have been recorded outside of the academic setting, an understanding of SCS technology and the possible consequences of manipulation is important in promoting safety. Methods: We review the components and implantation protocol of a SCS system, the functionality and technological specifications for SCS systems in the global market based on their device manuals, and patient- and clinician-specific adjustable factors. Furthermore, we assess documented instances of implantable medical device hacking and speculate on the potential harms of targeting SCS systems. Results: SCS systems from Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, and Nevro have unique functionality and technological specifications. Six parameters in device control can potentially be targeted and elicit various harms, including loss of therapeutic effect, accelerated battery drainage, paresthesia in unintended locations, muscle weakness or dysfunction, tissue burn, and electrical shock. Conclusions: Based on the history of implantable medical device hacking, SCS systems may also be susceptible to manipulation. As the prevalence of SCS use increases and SCS systems continuously evolve in the direction of wireless control and compatibility with mobile devices, appropriate measures should be taken by manufacturers and governmental agencies to ensure safety. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091885410

As a response, many infection treatments and detecting methods have been proposed. The signature-based methods are currently utilized to delete malware; however, these methods cannot provide accurate detection of zero-day attacks and polymorphic viruses. Contrarily, the use of machine learning-based detection has been recognized as one of the most modern and notable methods. Specifically, these methods can be categorized based on their analysis technique into static, dynamic, or hybrid. The purpose of this work was to provide a survey that determines the best features extraction and classification methods that result in the best accuracy in detecting malware. Moreover, a review of representable research papers in this topic is represented with a detailed tabular comparison between them based on their accuracy in detecting malware. Among these methods, the J48 algorithm and Hybrid analysis outperformed the others with the accuracy of 100% in detecting malware in the Windows system. On the other hand, the same accuracy has been achieved in the Android system when employing the Decision Tree algorithm through Dynamic analysis. We believe that this study performs a base for further research in the field of malware analysis with machine learning methods. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099682491

And as more and more of us use Internet technology for this, the issue of information security is becoming even more acute. Everyone who deals with the need to make a choice (whether it concerns their own affairs or the interests of the company where you work) wants to be sure that the resources of time, work will not be lost or stolen by dishonest competitors. Because this will lead to significant material losses in order to bring everything back to its original state, when the data has not yet been created by outsiders. It is known that those who were able to defend themselves in cases that require the use of open information space, spend much less and earn much more profit. Therefore, the risk in such cases is at least unreasonable or, in simple words, unnecessary and unnecessary. Thus, one of the above tasks facing a person today is to choose a higher education institution (HEI) for the applicant and his parents. Since the epidemic that has spread around the world has made its adjustments, most higher education institutions provide a remote opportunity for this choice. Because it is quite unpleasant as a result to learn that the desired specialty (for which the entrant wants to combine all his future professional life) failed to apply due to 'system failures', which became the object of external attacks. Time is already wasted, all budgets are already allocated and occupied. And it remains or go to some other specialty, which is far from the case, even if it is related. Or wait another year. Neither the first nor the second should take place at all. It is proposed to consider a model for solving this problem, which combines soft calculations of artificial intelligence and strategic management. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101713916

However, their use for work purposes is largely becoming a common practice as most organisations rather prefer to find security countermeasures than miss out on the momentous benefits they provide. Since the weakest link in cybersecurity is the human element, organisations are increasingly looking for ways to upskill their employees so that they can be able to implement the necessary security safeguards. Yet, a concerning trend is that even individuals with a high-security self-efficacy sometimes fail to take the needed security actions. To better understand why this occurs, the present study proposes and validates psychological ownership as a possible boundary condition for explaining the security self-efficacy to security behaviour nexus in the mobile security context. Using an online survey with 214 respondents, this study showed that both the direct and indirect effects of security self-efficacy on mobile device security behaviour were moderated by psychological ownership such that the effects were more pronounced when psychological ownership was high than when it was low.

These devices are used for example to manage the energy of smart factories efficiently or to monitor the infrastructure of smart-grids. By design, they typically exhibit homogeneous behavior, with similar software and hardware architecture. Unfortunately, these devices are also of interest to attackers aiming to develop botnets or compromise companies' security. This paper presents a new protection approach based on Hardware Performance Counters (HPC) to detect anomalies in massively deployed devices. These HPC are processed using outlier detection algorithms. Compared to existing solutions, we propose a lightweight approach based on a comparative analysis of devices' HPC without relying on the modeling of the software applications running on the devices. To assess the relevance and the effectiveness of the approach, a thorough experimental analysis is carried out in a representative industrial-type environment, sampling the data from 100 Raspberry Pi to simulate about 10,000 devices deployed simultaneously. The results show high detection and performance efficiency under different software profiles and attack payloads. Moreover, the calibration of the approach depends primarily on the hardware rather than the application software running on the devices.

Then, we build several DGA classifiers based on different machine learning and deep learning methods. Apart from separating DGA domains from benign ones, classifiers with deep learning models can also support multi-classification and identify DGA families.

For this didactic reconstruction of teaching content, we use an approach called the hybrid interaction system framework. In cybersecurity training, teaching interventions oftentimes are in a way successful but seem to not lead to long-lasting changes towards secure behavior. Using simply password security as an example, we show how this new approach recombines the two different priory mentioned teaching approaches in a novel way. Within this short paper, we present our current research progress, discuss potentials and values of the approach in general, and by way of example. Our intention of this submission and early disclosure is to spark discussion and generate further insights especially regarding the following question: What implications does the hybrid interaction system approach have on learning scenarios? © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117540491

Accordingly, vehicles, usually referred to as smart, are seeing their architecture revamped to integrate connection to the outside environment (V2X) and autonomous driving. A significant part of these innovations is enabled by machine learning. However, deploying such systems raises some concerns. First, the complexity of the algorithms often prevents understanding what these models learn, which is relevant in the safety-critical context of mobility. Second, several studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of machine learning-based algorithms to adversarial attacks. For these reasons, research on the explainability of machine learning is raising. In this paper, we then explore the role of interpretable machine learning in the ecosystem of smart vehicles, with the goal of figuring out if and in what terms explanations help to design secure vehicles. We provide an overview of the potential uses of explainable machine learning, along with recent work in the literature that has started to investigate the topic, including from the perspectives of human-agent systems and cyber-physical systems.

Our brains can “effortlessly” resolve the first question, but will definitely fail in the second one because many fine temporal scale gait patterns surely escape our eyes. Based on accelerometers’ 3D gait time series databases, we link the answers toward both questions via multiscale structural dependency within gait dynamics of our musculoskeletal system. Two types of dependency manifestations are explored. We first develop simple algorithmic computing called Principle System-State Analysis for the coarse dependency in implicit forms. Principle System-State Analysis is shown to be able to efficiently classifying among many subjects. We then develop a multiscale Local-1st-Global-2nd Coding Algorithm and a landmark computing algorithm. With both algorithms, we can precisely dissect rhythmic gait cycles, and then decompose each cycle into a series of cyclic gait phases. With proper color-coding and stacking, we reconstruct and represent an individual’s gait dynamics via a 3D cylinder to collectively reveal universal deterministic and stochastic structural patterns on centisecond (10 milliseconds) scale across all rhythmic cycles.

However, they are still affected by stochastic terms, notably a high Dark Count Rate (DCR), limiting their use when single photo-electron pulses convey the required information, for instance in chemiluminescence or fluorescence analysis of biological samples. In such applications, randomness of the spontaneous generation of carriers triggering the avalanche and the rate of occurrences is significantly decreasing the sensitivity of the system against solutions based, for instance, on traditional photo-multiplier tubes. However, unpredictability of the “dark” pulses has a potential value in domains connected to encryption and, in general terms, cybersecurity. ”Random Power” is a project approved within the ATTRACT call for proposals (https://attract-eu.com), having as a main goal the generation of random bit streams by properly analysing the time sequence of the Dark Pulses.

While much research has focused on understanding or predicting user susceptibility to phishing with the aim of preventing it, little of this research has focused on modeling the process of being phished holistically. Specifically, while the outcome of interacting with a phishing website may be thought of as binary (e.g., ""Were you phished or not?""), the actual process typically involves a sequence of stages spanning from the choice to visit (or not visit) a link all the way to transacting with a website and giving away valuable personal or financial information. To better understand the variables that influence phishing website traversal, we conducted a controlled lab experiment with a large sample of 908 participants. In this experiment, each participant was given a task such as opening an online checking account and presented with a series of simulated search results that included both legitimate and phishing websites. By monitoring participants' interactions with these websites and collecting additional information via surveys, we evaluated which variables were the most likely to result in behavior that could lead to greater phishing exposure using a multi-model comparison approach. The results of our analyses shed light on the key variables that can lead to a greater propensity for being phished and may prove invaluable to researchers interested in designing new interventions. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098999539

It is thus important to understand the capabilities of an attacker to identify homoglyphs - particularly ones that have not been previously spotted - and leverage them in attacks. We investigate a deep-learning model using embedding learning, transfer learning, and augmentation to determine the visual similarity of characters and thereby identify potential homoglyphs. Our approach uniquely takes advantage of weak labels that arise from the fact that most characters are not homoglyphs. Our model drastically outperforms the Normal-ized Compression Distance approach on pairwise homoglyph identification, for which we achieve an average precision of 0.97.

To measure clustering performance, we propose a metric (mBIOU) building on the classic Intersection-Over-Union (IOU) metric. Our clustering method achieves 0.592 mBIOU, compared to 0.430 for the naive baseline.

One of the challenges is that in most organizational settings, the detection paradigm is inherently about identifying and reacting to threats in real-time, as they are unfolding. As a way to complement these efforts with greater foresight, we introduce the idea of phishcasting - forecasting of phishing threat levels weeks or months into the future. Given that phishing attack volume time series data is noisy and devoid of traditional seasonal and cyclical trends, we extend the time series forecasting framework to utilize multiple time series, auxiliary information and alternate representations. We also introduce CoT-Net, a flexible, end-to-end CNN-LSTM based deep learning method for forecasting of complex phishing attack volume time series. CoT-Net uses time series embeddings to uncover correlations between organizational attack patterns within and across industry sectors. Using a publicly available test bed featuring multiple organizations' attack volume over time, we find CoT-Net to outperform most state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods.

A technique in ATTCK specifies a set of adversary actions to achieve a particular goal, such as Exfiltration over Command and Control channel.

A key challenge in identifying such cyber intelligence from natural language texts is that for a given action, such as encrypted traffic, many alternative expressions are possible (e.g., send using a self-signed certificate, send using HTTPS requests).

However, designing an EMPC paradigm for a general class of nonlinear DAEs systems while ensuring asymptotic convergence to a small neighborhood of the origin as well as recursive feasibility is an open research challenge that has not been considered. In addition, adapting to new economic considerations for optimal process operations within the scope of MPC is an interesting practical research matter. Inspired by the aforementioned considerations, this paper introduces an Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) paradigm that can optimize different economic cost functions for nonlinear DAE systems while meeting input and states constraints.

In this paper, the author proposes a neural network approach to assessing cybersecurity risks, based on a quantitative assessment and takes into account the use of a large number of devices and their constant interaction. A three-layer perceptron was chosen as a model of a neural network, datasets were generated synthetically using a network simulator NS-3. Experimental results showed that the neural network model proposed by the author allows for rapidly changing conditions to unambiguously and reasonably assess the risks of cybersecurity. The developed risk assessment method is comprehensive and adapted to various types of objects in large dynamic networks of a smart city. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100634473

Customers are progressively becoming conscious of some of the threat and several of them now shun away from some suspicious activities over the internet as a form of protection. This study aims to explore the factors that influence users’ to adopt security behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: A synthesis of theories – Self-efficacy and technology threat avoidance theories – was used to examine the security behaviour of users of MFSs. Data was gathered from 530 students in Ghana using convenience sampling technique. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics and structural equation model. Findings: Outcome of the investigation indicate that both mastery experience and verbal persuasion have substantial effect on the avoidance motivation of MFSs users. It was, however, found that emotional state and vicarious experience of users do not influence their avoidance motivation. Also, it was established that avoidance motivation is a positive prognosticator of avoidance behaviour. Practical implications: Understanding the security behaviour of MFS users will help the operators to outline strategies to sustain the successes achieved. Originality/value: Studies on user security behaviour are rare, especially in sub Saharan Africa, thus, this study will contribute to extant literature by adding a new dimension of user security behaviour. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086865477

We conduct an empirical study which explores issues pertaining to data protection, safety, trust, ethics, and cybersecurity. We conducted two Amazon Mechanical Turk studies that investigate users' perception on app permission requests for different smartwatch applications. Our findings suggest that most users lack proper understanding of the cybersecurity risks posed and were unable to construe the rationale for permissions requests for popular smartwatch applications. Furthermore, the respondents believed that app developers might misuse their data, thereby, indicating lack of trust towards these app development enterprises. The respondents also believe that the application development companies should be held accountable for their alleged involvement in data breaches and privacy issues. Further, the majority of survey respondents indicated having some unease towards data usage policies of developers. Moreover, respondents consider all common types of private data (location, health and fitness, photos etc.) susceptible to some level of data breach. Lastly, our results indicate that the study participants experienced confusion in the 'usability' versus 'security' conundrum-while a bare majority of the users wanted ease of access, a similar minority preferred a higher level of security.

However, effective forecasting can be challenging in noisy contexts devoid of time series data encompassing stationarity, cyclicality, completeness, and non-sparseness. Cyber-security is a good example of such context. In organizational security settings, predicting time series related to emerging attacks could enhance cyber threat intelligence, resulting in timely and actionable insights at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels. In order to explore this gap, we propose a deep generative model-based framework for time series forecasting in noisy data environments. The proposed framework incorporates a novel ensembling strategy where generative adversarial networks and recurrent variational autoencoders are leveraged in unison with base predictors for enhanced regularization of time series predictive models. The framework is extensible, supporting different model combinations and analytical or iterative model fusion strategies. Using a test bed encompassing 10 years of weekly phishing attack volume data from 5 organizations in the technology, financial services, and social networking sectors, we show that the framework can boost predictive power for various standard time series models. Additional results reveal that the framework outperforms generative data augmentation approaches designed to enrich the input time series data matrices. Collectively, our findings suggest that utilizing generative models in more robust end-to-end setup can improve prediction in cyber threat intelligence contexts, as well as related problems involving challenging time series data. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101357435

Specifically, we discuss the use of science gateways to access Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), a US regulatory standard that covers a broad range of US federal government-owned or regulated data, and that also provides a useful proxy for other types of sensitive data, such as private sector intellectual property. We focus on the impact of CUI requirements on science gateway platforms that can be used to create and manage science gateway instances. Gateway platforms are centrally operated by gateway platform providers who create and control gateway instances on behalf of gateway providers. Broadly, platforms operate following either a multi-tenant or else a multi-instance pattern. Multi-tenanted science gateway platforms are designed to support multiple science gateways simultaneously, with each gateway as a tenant to a single operational instance of the platform middleware. Multi-instance platforms, on the other hand, provide and manage an entire instance of the science gateway software for each gateway. This paper reviews these two scenarios from the perspective of the Science Gateways Platform as a service (SciGaP), a multitenanted gateway platform based on the open-source Apache Airavata software. We examine requirements for providing multitenanted platforms for CUI gateways and also the requirements for providing the same software as a multi-instance platform. In both cases, we assume the use of CUI-compatible resources from commercial cloud providers. Both approaches are technically feasible but have trade-offs that must be considered. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099733532

However, currently, most of the international maritime safety conventions have started to cover both aspects. In the analysis of most incidents and accidents at sea, it is quite difficult to delimit safety and security matters and, normally, after a breakdown, it is useless to do it since the planning and response to risks are usually given in an integrated manner. On the other hand, we are witnessing a progressive extension of the concept of maritime safety to include protection (or security) matters simultaneously with the emergence of a new type of threats that are always present from the moment computers are connected to networks anywhere the world: cyber threats! With ships equipped with new advanced technologies, protection against cyber-attacks is more important than ever. These technological advances have become an easy and high-priority target for cyber criminals. With this behaviour, they can pursue their purpose of attacking ships’ systems and, from them, different systems ashore. The digitization of the maritime industry took place very quickly. However, it has become essential for seafarers not only to understand and adopt these new technologies, but also to take a cautious attitude towards certain events that can follow in the wrong direction in a short period of time. A new stage of maritime readiness is envisaged, which needs a robust and well-defined “code” that broadens and concretizes a “new” concept of maritime safety in the broad sense that reinforces international maritime conventions and their application. The responsibilities of the ""Flag States"" and ""Port States"", under the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and international maritime conventions as laid down in the different Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) at world level and in the documents of the IMO and other international organizations (such as the European Union), should be updated and start to consider, also, maritime security matters. In addition, it is essential to support close cooperation in the fields of maritime safety and maritime security with a view to drawing up a new and robust “Maritime Code”. This will be the guideline pursued, with the intention, at this moment, to “shake and roll” this matter towards a new regulatory stage. © 2020, Observare.

Global images of malware (in a program that includes personal information) can be utilized to detect or classify it. This method is efficient, given that small changes in the program can be detected while maintaining the overall structure of the program. However, if any obfuscation approach that encrypts malware code is implemented, it becomes difficult to extract features such as opcodes and application programming interface functions. Given that malware detection and classification are performed differently depending on whether malware is obfuscated or not, methods that can simultaneously detect and classify general and obfuscated malware are required. This paper proposes a method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) and global image-based local image to classify unobfuscated and obfuscated malware. Global and local images of unobfuscated malware are generated using pixel and local feature visualizers. The GAN is utilized to visualize local features and generate local images of obfuscated malware by learning global and local images of unobfuscated malware. The local image of unobfuscated malware is merged with the global image generated via the pixel visualizer. To merge the global and local images of unobfuscated and obfuscated malware, the pixels extracted from global and local images are stored in a two-dimensional array, and then merged images are generated. Finally, unobfuscated and obfuscated malware are classified using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The results of experiments conducted on the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) dataset indicate that the proposed method has a malware classification accuracy of 99.65%, which is 2.18% higher than that of the malware classification approach based on only global images and local features. © 2020 by the authors.

Human actions, when related to cyber-based corporate espionage, cannot be described through rudimentary factors supporting causation for “betrayal” and the motivation to compromise proprietary technology and economic information belonging to a business entrusting its secrets with an employee. The underlying issue is about how to identify a potential actor willing to compromise their “integrity” in exchange for personal gain or personal interest even when the penalty will be far greater than the reward.

The integration of the Internet, Internet of Things, and Industrial Internet of Things exposed the cybersecurity resource limited programmable logic controllers, intelligent electronic devices, sensors, and actuators to an expanded range of threats. The need for increased cyber security in this environment requires improvement in controls against vulnerabilities in CPS. Many CPS operate with the incorporation of a state estimation system. State estimation systems provide insight into the typically unobservable system state given observable measurements and relations of those measurements to the system state. Measurements outside of 3-sigma are discarded as bad measurements. Current methods establish the accepted boundary of measurements. The potential inclusion of cyber-attack data within accepted boundary define a set of sub-erroneous outliers which are within normal operations yet below current outliers. Outlier algorithms may be implemented to detect sub-erroneous outliers.

Also, students encounter it as a phenomenon of their everyday lives, e.g. when using messengers that advertise encrypted communication. They will thus in most cases have preconceptions about what encrypted communication means that they will bring into the classroom. As in many cases, we expect these conceptions to be incomplete or even inappropriate. Knowing the extent and limitations of students' prior ideas informs lessons planning and, when addressed properly, fosters both learning and conceptual change. Therefore, we present the results of a mixed-methods investigation into the conception of secure messaging held by both K-12 students and pre-service teachers. We inductively coded written and drawn responses to a situated assessment administered as a questionnaire and, after refining the codesystem, tried to identify different types of conceptions by clustering the responses. Our results indicate that students first and foremost lack a clear understanding of networked communication that may subsequently prevent them from forming correct mental models about cybersecurity. As cybersecurity is a topic that is usually seen as part of a ""digital competence""- and as such may also be taught by subjects other than CS - we discuss how our findings might inform a cross-subject approach to teaching it. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094974307

Users are frequently required to make decisions that have important security implications, that requires a mental model of software infrastructure to know what actions are g safe' versus g unsafe'. People build internal causal models of what they experience that have explanatory and predictive power, and therefore form the basis of the decision-making faculty. By concealing security information, user interfaces hinder the user from building the kinds of models that will keep them safer, and only the small minority who are willing to go beyond the interface will acquire this knowledge. We suggest increasing the visibility of some essential information about the security-relevant aspects of software functionality in a way that ordinary users will be able to make sense of, so that through normal interactions with software everyone develops the kind of knowledge needed to better support security.

Despite the research on FDIAs and attack detection on smart grids, comparatively less amount of work looked into the robustness of distributed DR schemes against FDIAs.

Cyber security professionals usually work as a part of a team that monitors and responds to incidents in the environment. A sufficiently realistic complex learning environment is necessary for collaborative learning at the expert level. Evaluating the learning outcomes of complex exercises is an important task for both assessing how individuals met the learning objectives, and how to improve the exercise to better serve those goals. This requires the assessment of multiple skill and knowledge categories independently. We leveraged the NIST NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework as a base for building knowledge categories for questionnaire use. However, the NICE framework is comprehensive and detailed requiring that the areas of competence assessment needed to be simplified for questionnaire use. We summarized the NICE framework into 44 questions addressed to the individuals who participated in the exercise. A web-based questionnaire was used to query 21 participants' skill level before and after the exercise, as well as their familiarity and experience with the topic before and during the exercise. The results indicate that cyber security exercises will increase the knowledge of the participant in the knowledge areas that were present in the exercise. This increase was more prominent in cases where the participant was more likely to recognize, and experience events related to that category during the exercise. Furthermore, we concluded that the NICE framework can be used to assess individual know-how and as a basis for knowledge-related questionnaires. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102890831

With the ubiquitous use of computing devices and applications today, the protection of personal and privileged information is a persistent challenge. Modern software applications are typically complex pieces of code that borrow from various preexisting software libraries. Consequently, a flaw in one piece of software can have far-reaching and often unintended security implications that malicious actors can exploit. Thus, cybersecurity education needs to be transformed from a purely academic enterprise for cybersecurity researchers into a necessary skill that is imparted to the current and future IT workforce at large. CHEESE aims to impart such skills.CHEESE is composed of CHEESEHub, a public web-platform hosting demonstrations of cybersecurity concepts, a set of lessons complementing the demonstrations, and a community-driven approach to the contribution of new demonstrations and lessons. CHEESE is intended to supplement and enhance traditional cybersecurity education with hands-on training that has been shown to improve concept retention and understanding. Instructors can incorporate CHEESE into their teaching in several ways: by utilizing one or more of the demonstrations hosted on the publicly-accessible CHEESEHub in conjunction with the web-accessible lessons; by deploying their own version of CHEESEHub with a custom set of demonstrations and lessons; or by developing their own lesson plan which borrows from and combines one or more demonstrations on CHEESEHub. The use of CHEESEHub only requires a web-browser and can hence be employed in a wide variety of educational and training settings from K-12 schools through university. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098568474

Historically, buffer overflow has been the number one security vulnerability in applications for many years. More recently, advances in protection methods including non-executable stack, canaries, ASLR, and Windows DEP have made buffer overflow attacks a much smaller security concern, but they are still a serious issue in embedded systems and micro-controllers. Therefore, it is still very important to teach students this topic. There are several tools available for teaching buffer overflow attacks, but there are no easily accessible interactive teaching tools to help students understand the concepts. We developed a web-based interactive visualization tool that aims to help students gain a deeper understanding of buffer overflow concepts. There are six learning components that build upon one another as well as an assessment after each component for immediate learning feedback. There is also a space shooter mini-game between each learning component. To evaluate the impact of this online visualization tool on students' learning, we developed in-game assessments, a pre-test, a post-test and a survey. This tool was used in two classes at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) and North Carolina AT State University (NC AT) in Fall 2019. The classroom experience reports and focus group discussion show that this tool helped students improve their understanding of buffer overflow concepts. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098550695

To protect cloud infrastructure, in our earlier work, we proposed Software Defined Security Service (SDS2) to tackle security challenges centered around a new policy-based interaction model. The security architecture consists of three main components: a Security Controller, Virtual Security Functions (VSF), and a Sec-Manage Protocol. However, the security architecture requires an agile and specific protocol to transfer interaction parameters and security messages between its components where OpenFlow considers mainly as network routing protocol. So, The Sec-Manage protocol has been designed specifically for obtaining policy-based interaction parameters among cloud entities between the security controller and its VSFs.

With the emergence of advanced technologies, the demand for security has been drastically increased over the past decade. The analysis of network traffic is essential for various tasks like security, capacity planning, and visibility at various levels. In this paper, a novel architecture is proposed which exploits two powerful techniques for network traffic inspection, that is, cluster analysis and statistical modeling, and unifies them in a single framework. The proposed architecture leverages the clustering technique and statistical modeling for analyzing and inspecting the network traffic. Instead of selecting NetFlow records as the primary format, this research paper presents an approach that employs Packet Capture (PCAP) data format for network analysis. The clustering technique can be used for classifying benign and malicious traffic but there may arise many uncertainties caused by various dynamic factors due to emerging application mixture. Our proposed model uses statistical modeling for supplementing the results obtained from clustering. This unified approach for traffic analysis reduces the chances of the false alert generation that substantially deteriorates the security ecosystem. The proposed architecture inspects different parameters of network traffic to uncover any strong correlation for identifying malicious network traffic flows. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099724059

Employability is known as skills, knowledge, and personal attributes a person should possess to become employed. In this article, we use the processual perspective on employability, which emphasizes identity formation. We argue that employability includes the student's ability to imagine their future work and employment possibilities and see themselves as part of a computer science profession. We use sociocultural theory as an analytical framework and have found the concept of imagination to be fruitful in shedding light on how first-year students imagine their future job. Through eight qualitative interviews with first-year cybersecurity students, we found that students had difficulties imagining their future dream job. We find that the students had not developed a computer science identity, even though the study program has some focus on identity formation through teaching discipline relevant courses from the first semester. In addition, companies visit the school and present their interests, and finally, some of the courses offer real-world scenarios for the students to engage in.

The first layer focuses on technologies and engineering processes to build a secure digital system. Then, the second layer is all about management or organizational procedures. Finally, the last layer consists of compliance with existing laws and regulations. The correlation between each layer is, first, focusing on the technology and engineering layer to get anything to build an organization's secure digital system. Then, create policies for all parties of the organizations. Last, make sure all of the technology used and procedures applied complied with the existing law. The last layer also has a role as if security breach success penetrates the two previous layers. The next is digital forensics to reveal the cyber incident and punish the criminals by the existing law. In general, this proposed reference model aims to guide organizations, companies, and governments in developing a secure digital system with a comprehensive perspective. In particular, the reference model has two use case actors, engineers, and researchers. For the engineer, this reference model guides to starting and developing a digital security system. There are five steps to creating a secure digital system using this reference model: preparation, specifications, system design, implementation, and evaluation. For the researcher, this reference model gives a comprehensive understanding. So the researcher gets a big picture of the secure digital system's research field before starting the research.

Smart home and smart building owners are increasingly deploying IoT devices to monitor and control their environments due to the rapid decline in the price of IoT devices. The recent intensive research has shown that network traffic traces of IoT devices have significant cybersecurity and privacy issues. These security and privacy defending techniques have enabled sophisticated approaches to ensure security and preserve user privacy. However, due to the fact that different approaches are evaluated using their own datasets, their own developed security and privacy attack models, and their own evaluating metrics, it is being significantly difficult to make a fair and comprehensive comparisons among different IoT security strengthening and user privacy preserving research to better understand IoT security issues and end-user benefits. To address this problem, we present a deep learning-based adversarial attack model framework-SmartAttack, which enables a set of sophisticated adversarial attack models that can be leveraged by researchers and industrial users from IoT security community to better evaluate their work. In essence, we leverage the most widely used unsupervised machine learning and deep learning models to design and implement these attack models. SmartAttack also provides user options to select the detailed configuration for each attack model, such as kernel, dataset splitting, cross-validation states, and evaluating metrics.

This paper presents a discussion of the impact of cybersecurity issues that occur during and are attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations. This discussion is facilitated by a simulation tool, the Disaster Vulnerability Threat and Impact Simulator System (DVTISS). DVTISS simulates the network structure, security measures, user characteristics and demographics, data, and devices of an organization or region's computing infrastructure. The system is provided input parameters and performs analysis to identify the combined results of numerous different decisions, which are made in concert, to identify the types of vulnerabilities that may be present and the impact of their exploitation. The impacts of system unavailability are considered. This can aid businesses, governments and others in determining the level of prioritization that should be given to cybersecurity considerations. The simulator can also be used for disaster preparedness and planning, evaluating particular response strategies and the evaluation of laws and policies that impact IT decision making during emergencies. This paper uses the DVTISS tool to consider organizational responses to several example emergency situations. It demonstrates the utility of the tool as well as its efficacy for decision making support.

This method is used to identify malicious commands resulting from cyber intrusions. It is used to detect insecure and/or inadvertent power order commands requested by systems external to the HVDC station's electronic security perimeter (ESP). It alarms and could stop external HVDC power orders that will trigger the operation of installed special protection systems or remedial action systems in interconnected electric grid. The method is based on 1) a continuous estimation of identified AC power line flow(s) resulting from the power order change command, 2) predicting the operation of identified remedial action schemes based on this continuous estimation and determination if the resulting power order change exceeds the protection trip threshold or security thresholds and 3) stopping the full execution of the HVDC power order change and alarming the HVDC control house and the central dispatch center.

External and insider attacks against the SCADA system are investigated with the SMP models and the results are compared. The system reliability is evaluated by reliability indexes including loss of load probability (LOLP) and expected energy not supplied (EENS) through Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The lurking threats of the cyberattacks are also analyzed in the study. Case studies were conducted on the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS-96). The results show that with the increase of the MTTCs of the cyberattacks, the LOLP values decrease.

Within it, IT relies on new and complex technologies like cyber-physical systems (CPS), that integrate hardware and software with new sensor and communication capabilities. Hence, such production systems become more vulnerable against malicious attacks due to bigger attack surfaces. Therefore, it is essential to address security as early as possible, i.e. during design process (Security by Design). In order to support security risk assessments during the design process, the standard IEC 62443 recommends to define zones addressing multiple security levels instead of using one security level for the complete factory. General ideas, rules and guidelines to define a cybersecurity zone concept are sufficiently described. However, approaches that allow both the model-based system design of industrial automation and control systems (IACS) and the zones, taking into account data flows, represent a gap in this research area. Our approach closes this gap by supporting the modeling of zones and taking explicitly defined data flows into account in a model-based system engineering tool that we created ourselves. To this, we present our domain-specific language (DSL), which meets the basic requirements of IEC 62443, and propose a methodology that takes into account the data flow between zones.

We face two major challenges when developing an undergraduate EH course, including the setup and choice of the lab design, and the choice and organization of covered topics for this course. On one hand, we have limited space, budget and technical support for a course that relies heavily on hands-on exercises. Given the nature of this course, the lab activities are often 'offensive' and lab operations demand administrative privileges, which cause compliance issues with the university's IT policies. On the other hand, given the vast variety of topics and the fast pace of the field, it is difficult to select and organize an essential set of knowledge units to ensure that students are exposed to current technologies and prepared to be industry-ready. We adopt two major design principles to address these challenges correspondingly. First, our choice of a hybrid Virtual Machine (VM)-based and Web-based labs provides students the full set of privileges to perform lab activities without posing threats to the campus network. The Web-based labs remove high cost of hardware and avoid overwhelming installations and configurations for the lab. Second, given the diversity of topics and fast developments in this field, we choose topics based on four criteria: representative, current, certification-related, and foundations for other covered concepts. The chosen topics are aligned with three EH certificates, and organized into twelve modules with clear inter-module and intra-module logic. This paper details the curriculum of this EH course and elaborates how our design principles are entailed in the course. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094930149

Our lesson plan includes a demonstration of a successful hack into NAO's video stream, followed by covert capturing of its live camera feed. We then discuss results from two separate experimental case studies, the first one being a conventional approach of introducing cybersecurity concepts via a traditional lesson plan, which involves no robot. The second study involves our non-traditional technique of introducing cybersecurity plus robotics using NAO. We present the student survey data collected from these two studies and discuss their respective outcomes. We also analyze the pre and post student survey-based assessment data from these studies for showing preliminary evidence of the effectiveness and potential of our approach.

Therefore, digital substations increasingly play an important role in power transmissions, providing stability and flexibility with regards to power supply. However, converting all substations to digital at once is not so straightforward due to limited budgets to retrofit the large number of serial-based legacy devices. Communications gateways can help overcome these concerns as they help serial-based legacy intelligence electronic devices (IEDs) communicate with Ethernet-based networks; they are also a cost-effective solution. With the serial-to-Ethernet problem solved, however, another issue raises its head: cyberattacks always pose huge threats to Ethernet-based networks, putting the issue of cybersecurity in retrofit power substations at the forefront. In substation retrofitting projects, communication gateways act as data concentrators managing the large numbers of legacy IEDs. In spite of their significantly important role, communication gateways rarely incorporate adequate security measures. Therefore, a high risk exists that malicious actors can easily access legacy IEDs through these gateways to cause power outages or even damage critical equipment to endanger people’s lives and cause huge financial losses. To eliminate these risks, a three-pronged approach, which entails baseline security requirements for communication gateways, communication protocol encryption, and role- based access control (RBAC), is recommended to secure communication gateways in networks. Using network devices equipped with basic security capabilities and that are IEC 62443-4-2 compliant is an effective precautionary measure to ward off cyberattacks. These basic security capabilities should include password cracking defense, sniffer and data breach prevention, tamper-resistant configuration files or programs, DDoS defense, and the account and identifier management. Furthermore, the monitoring and controlling of IEDs in refurbished substations requires more stable and secure network infrastructure so that the status of network devices, such as switches, IEDs, and communication gateways, is available at all times. All Ethernet devices should have a MIB-like function, such as SNMP technology, to monitor and maintain the devices. SNMPv3 is highly recommended because of its enhanced security design. Networks are especially vulnerable to cyberattacks if data from Ethernet-based communications protocols is unencrypted. Once hackers have invaded a substation’s network, they can easily capture data and learn a lot about a network’s communication behavior. What’s more, they can easily cause havoc by sending a misleading command to control an IED. To counteract these types of malicious activities, communication gateways should employ Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for communication protocols such as Modbus, DNP3.0, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850. TLS v1.2 or later is highly recommended, as it is reported that TLS v1.0 has major vulnerabilities and TLS v1.1 has outdated encryption methods. With regards to the misoperation of assets, role-based access control (RBAC) is the ideal model to address this issue, especially in complex systems. Most incidents of misoperation occur when engineers have access to information or sections of a network that do not pertain to their job function, creating a setting ripe for mishaps. More importantly, no matter whether employees get promoted or resign, their privilege level must be adjusted or revoked accordingly. Thus, network access should be based on the roles of individual users within the network, and communication gateways should be capable of assigning the necessary permission for access to the different role players. © 2020, CIGRE.

Due to the increasing variety and severity of cybersecurity threats, traditional means of network security protection have ushered in a huge challenge. The network security posture prediction can effectively predict the network development trend in the future time based on the collected network history data, so this paper proposes an algorithm based on simulated annealing-particle swarm algorithm to optimize improved Elman neural network parameters to achieve posture prediction for network security. Taking advantage of the characteristic that the value of network security posture has periodicity, a simulated annealing algorithm is introduced along with an improved particle swarm algorithm to solve the problem that neural network training is prone to fall into a local optimal solution and achieve accurate prediction of the network security posture. Comparison of the proposed scheme with existing prediction methods validates that the scheme has a good posture prediction accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102660326

And ransomware is considered one of the main categories of cybercrime. The Wannacry ransomware attack broken out in 2017 is one of the largest ransomware attacks in history, creating huge threats to the data security of individual users and enterprises. Since 2017, although the principle of Wannacry has been figured comprehensively and numerous detection and defense methods have been proposed, all of these existing methods have some defects. Therefore, we propose to build a comprehensive detection approach of Wannacry with a set of rules, which is named Comprehensive Wannacry Detection Rules (CWDR). Through principle analysis, we extract the traffic features. And these features can be easily distinguished from other normal traffic information during the Wannacry attack. Base on these traffic features, a set of rules is designed to detect the attack process of Wannacry. CWDR rule set can detect Wannacry at all 8 stages through network traffic monitoring. Finally, we instantiate the rule set using Suricata and do benchmark experiments with ET Open rule set and Snort rule set. In the basic experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 0%, 25%, 50%. In the evasion experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 12.5%, 75%, 62.5%. The results show that the CWDR rule set can detect the attack process of Wannacry ransomware more precisely. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100507673

The continuous malicious attacks on the network have directly caused a huge threat to the user's spirit and property. In order to deal with the complex security situation in today's network environment, an intelligent network situational awareness model based on deep neural networks is proposed. Use the nonlinear characteristics of the deep neural network to solve the nonlinear fitting problem, establish a network security situation assessment system, take the situation indicators output by the situation assessment system as a guide, and collect on the main data features according to the characteristics of the network attack method, the main data features are collected and the data is preprocessed. This model designs and trains a 4-layer neural network model, and then use the trained deep neural network model to understand and analyze the network situation data, so as to build the network situation perception model based on deep neural network. The deep neural network situational awareness model designed in this paper is used as a network situational awareness simulation attack prediction experiment. At the same time, it is compared with the perception model using gray theory and Support Vector Machine(SVM). The experiments show that this model can make perception according to the changes of state characteristics of network situation data, establish understanding through learning, and finally achieve accurate prediction of network attacks.

Although there are main security concerns with IoT services over cloud computing services, cloud computing is mostly preferred to provide seamless and scalable Intern-based services. Moreover, cloud service providers are continuously extending their capacity to reach more industries and address their concerns. For example, Amazon has recently launched a pay-as-you-go cloud computing service that will take place on satellite operators to provide more IoT services to industries such as the agricultural and shipping industries.

These newly connected objects together form the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The energy sector is currently exploring the possibilities offered by the Internet of Things. However, for this sector, network intelligence is not a completely new phenomenon. The electrical networks already have information retrieval capacities for their monitoring and control, but these are still limited. The meeting of IoT and Smart Grids opens the way to data collection from all points of the network and in real time. Certain data previously collected in an aggregated manner over large geographic areas could now be collected on a local scale, near production or transmission points, and at a reasonable cost. It is also the massive accumulation of this data and its processing that is possible today. The smart grid is a network for the transport and distribution of electricity that is enhanced by capacities in terms of digital control, surveillance and telecommunications. It provides a two-way, real-time exchange of energy and information between the various players in the electricity chain, from the production site to commercial, industrial and residential users. The energy transition and the new smart grids raise many challenges in terms of industrial cybersecurity. Digital exchanges are intensifying (production, distribution and consumption are interconnected) and the use of connected objects (facilitating remote monitoring, observation and control of the entire value chain) increases the degree of vulnerability of information systems industrial. The cybersecurity of smart grids is today a decisive element in ensuring global security of our global energy systems. The purpose of this work is to present a comprehensive overview of challenges, threats and some solutions of security in IoT based smart grid.

This paper presents our Model-Based Security Testing (MBST) approach, designed for cybersecurity evaluation of the OTA update system for automobiles, which has an integrated testbed and a software tool that is capable of automatically generating and executing test cases by using attack trees as an input. Integrating threat modelling in the testing provides several benefits, including clear and systematic identification of different threats. Automation of the test-case generation and execution has the obvious benefits of saving time and manual effort, as manual test-case generation is both a time-consuming and error-prone process (especially, when the testing involves several test-cases). A simple simulated attack is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our testing approach. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research that uses a testing approach similar to our approach for automotive OTA security evaluation. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091756308

However, both the quantity and capability of industrial control system (ICS)-targeted cyber-attacks have grown dramatically over recent years. Therefore, one of the most significant challenges that digital I&C systems bring is the issue of cybersecurity, which should be enhanced before their deployment. Several different types of cyber-attacks can be introduced to NPPs; a false data injection attack on key equipment is the focus of this research due to the potential severe consequences associated with such an attack. In false data injection, the attackers may alter the reading of control sensors or commands to change the operation of an NPP. Current cybersecurity efforts focus on intrusion prevention by firewalls or data-flow direction control and use commercial intrusion detection systems, which usually focus on monitoring Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, ports, and payload length. However, attention should be given to conditions where these approaches can fail, such as an insider attack. Previous research based on process data shows the potential of a last defenseâ, line using online monitoring of the process data in concern with cyber data analysis. However, existing models involve different subsystems across the whole NPP, which has a wide attack surface and may require high computing cost. This holistic approach may not meet the time-sensitive requirements imposed upon I&C systems. This paper proposes a localized kit for key equipment in a process as a complementary detection method to improve the robustness of key equipment under cyber-attacks. Compared to existing models, this reduces the number of variables used in the model and significantly improves the computational speed. It also reduces the attack surface by limiting the data acquisition locally. This localized kit includes a cyber-attack detection model to detect anomalies within key components, such as the control system actuator, and an inference model to potentially reconstruct a compromised signal to allow the safe shut down. To develop and demonstrate the localized cybersecurity kit, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed was built with a pressurized water reactor (PWR) simulator and a programmable logical controller (PLC). The PLC was programmed to control the steam generator (SG) water level at a specified set point, and the PWR simulator was utilized to simulate the nuclear system and response for parameters outside of the SG. Three false data injection attacks were conducted towards the testbed to generate the data needed for the localized kit development and evaluation. The results show the cyber-attack detection model is effective under false data injection scenarios and the inference model is promising as a signal reconstruction method. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089847700

We analyzed survey items measuring purchase behavior, user's security settings, software settings, and trust in websites from the 2014 Eurobarometer (N=26,879). The findings of latent class analysis show three groups based on members’ cybersecurity preparedness: uninformed users, disciplined users, and cautious users. The determinants of cybersecurity preparedness were examined using two-level hierarchical logit modeling. While sociodemographic factors modestly contribute to cybersecurity preparedness at an individual level, country-level economic status (GDP per capita) and cybersecurity preparedness (Global Cybersecurity Index) appear to be significant for individual-level cybersecurity preparedness. In countries with higher cybersecurity preparedness and economic status, individuals tend to show a higher level of cybersecurity preparedness.

In this research, using a deception game (DG), we evaluate the influence of network size on adversary’s cyberattack decisions. The DG has two sequential stages, probe and attack, and it is defined as DG (n,k, γ), where n is the number of servers, k is the number of honeypots, and γ is the number of probes that the adversary makes before attacking the network. In the probe stage, participants may probe a few web servers or may not probe the network. In the attack stage, participants may attack any one of the web servers or decide not to attack the network. In a laboratory experiment, participants were randomly assigned to a repeated DG across three different between-subject conditions: small (20 participants), medium (20 participants), and large (20 participants). The small, medium, and large conditions used DG (2, 1, 1), DG (6, 3, 3), and DG (12, 6, 6) games, respectively (thus, the proportion of honeypots was kept constant at 50% in all three conditions). Results revealed that in the small network, the proportions of honeypot and no-attack actions were 0.20 and 0.52, whereas in the medium (large) network, the proportions of honeypot and no-attack actions were 0.50 (0.50) and 0.06 (0.03), respectively. There was also an effect of probing actions on attack actions across all three network sizes. We highlight the implications of our results for networks of different sizes involving deception via honeypots. © Copyright © 2020 Katakwar, Aggarwal, Maqbool and Dutt.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094144451

This is of special concern in mission-critical networked systems upon which our civil, industrial, and defense infrastructures increasingly rely. One approach to tackle this challenge is to endow these systems with dynamic computational diversity, wherein each processor assumes a sequence of unique variants, such that it executes only machine code encoded for a variant during the time interval of that variant's existence. The variants are drawn from a very large set, all adhering to a computational diversity architecture, which is based on an underlying instruction set architecture. Thus any population of machines belonging to a specific diversity architecture consists of a temporally dynamic set of essentially-unique variants. However, an underlying ISA enables development of a common development toolchain for the diversity architecture. Our approach is hardware-centric, relying on the rapidly developing microelectronics technologies of ternary computing, resistive RAM (ReRAM) memory, and physical unclonable functions.

The management of the railway operations through the use of distributed sensors and controllers and with programmable and remotely controllable railway signals and switches has led to gains in system efficiency as well as operational flexibility. However, the network connectivity has opened up the railway cyber communication networks to cyber-attacks. These are a class of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with interconnected physical, computational, and communication components. The cyber-attacks on these systems could potentially cascade through these inter-connection and result into significant damage. These systems are safety-critical owing to their large-scale monetary and, more importantly, human life safety concerns. Therefore, it is better to incorporate security and resilience requirements right from the design time. In this paper, we describe a domain-specific framework for simulations in the railway domain. The framework allows analyzing the resilience of railway operations in the presence of cyber-attacks. In particular, our simulation framework allows modeling the railway network as well as the railway transportation. It provides an online graphical modeling environment that allows multiple users to collaborate, through a web-based interface, over the same model for the railway infrastructure as well as network attacks. The framework also allows the user to configure and run experiments through the web-interface and also to visualize the key operational metrics from the railway domain as the experiment is running. The framework also supports executing large simulations in the cloud. In addition, it supports hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for incorporating physical effects and network attacks that can only be realized realistically in the hardware.

We apply qualitative analysis on 729, 908, and 5336 open source software (OSS) bug reports respectively, collected from Gentoo, LibreOffice, and Mozilla to investigate if bug reports include vulnerability discovery strategies i.e. sequences of computation and/or cognitive activities that an attacker performs to discover vulnerabilities, where the vulnerability is indexed by a credible source, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We evaluate two approaches namely, text feature-based approach and regular expression-based approach to automatically identify bug reports that include vulnerability discovery strategies. We observe the Gentoo, LibreOffice, and Mozilla bug reports to include vulnerability discovery strategies. Using text feature-based prediction models, we observe the highest prediction performance for the Mozilla dataset with a recall of 0.78.

The steady development of UAS has created a dynamic environment moving at faster pace than manned aviation. In particular, there is an intense pressure on operations in very low altitudes where market is driven by new business models. Commercial UAS operators are expected to monitor weather, changes in airspace structure, avoid buildings and temporary obstacles, consider potential risks arising from the ground, and maintain separation from manned aviation. On the other hand, authorities are expected to monitor, and control unmanned aerial traffic as well as enforce the airspace rules. To address this arising requirements unmanned traffic management is being developed and deployed in numerous countries, which aims to enable safe and efficient operations of highly automated UAS in automated unmanned traffic management (UTM) system developed on foundations of modern technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet-of-Things, 5G networks while considering the need to address cybersecurity requirements. Among cybersecurity requirements a potential candidate with promising applications is blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger of immutable records stored in a decentralized database. This paper discusses potential applications of blockchain technology that could support UAS operations and increase security in storing crucial flight data. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103856997

Cryptography is the core of the research in data security and a fundamental component in information assurance yet complex topic, with its purpose to conceal and authenticate information. Hence, teaching cryptography-based security protocols in an effective and engaging manner is a challenging problem throughout international HE sectors. With explanations usually based around mathematical notations, it can be a daunting and difficult subject for many students. This point is emphasized by the consistently lower marks achieved, in comparison to other course modules. To combat this, we propose the CYPHER platform, which delivers a motivating and engaging practical element to teaching and learning popular cryptographic protocols. It customizes a real-world scenarios that are illustrated by animation videos to depict and simplify a number of well-known cryptographic protocols. CYPHER provides an interactive learning experience, allowing the breakdown of complex topics to a level understood by each student. By providing assessment gamification, the delivered knowledge will be assessed in a fun way by playing a game to pass a number of stages and measure the level of understanding.

Many solutions have been proposed to prevent and detect phishing attacks such as users' awareness methods and detection tools. However, phishing still on the top of attacks with a high number of victims. One of the main reasons is the lack of users' knowledge. This could have more severe effects on Arabic users as most of the proposed mitigation solutions have not considered Arabic users.

In order to prompt response to serve incidents or ignore false alarms, alerts are prioritised and analysed. Security professionals rely on information provided in the alert message. Insufficient information in alert messages raises challenges for security analysts that require them to keep track of all internal and external sources to identify the relevant information. In this paper, a Narrative Analytics-Assisted System (NAAS) is proposed, and a knowledge graph is used in the proposed system to present the relationships The knowledge graph is proposed to capture the complex relationships between the alert and relevant information from the Internal and External knowledge bases to reduce the cognitive effort in information digestion and to understand a wealth of security data. To enable cooperation in the cyber risk management process, it is an inevitable necessity to generate the knowledge graph and interpret it in a human-friendly format The current machine-friendly formats for reporting incidents from alerts are complex and of an extensive nature These characteristics hamper the readability and contribution, therefore preventing humans from understanding and being up to date about the incident. NAAS contains four life cycles to assist an analyst to have a better perception of the elements of the environment by involving more staff in the risk management: (1) Analyses the alert, (2) designs the knowledge graph with the natural language sentences, (3) automatically implements the incident report in natural language by applying novel storytelling techniques from the knowledge graph, and (4) maintains it with the contribution of different levels of expertise The performance of various NAAS's cycles is demonstrated in a case study with an example scenario from the Security Operations Centre (SOC) at an educational institution, highlighting its useability. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102935528

This research sought to address that gap by exploring the conversations that take place on hacking forums and subreddits. Text in hacking related threads was collected from these sites over a period of several months. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software was used to determine the linguistic characteristics of each forum/ subreddit. Thematic analysis was then conducted on a sub-set of text from each source. The results of the LIWC analysis indicated that there are variations in several psychologically relevant factors between these forums and subreddits, including the degree to which users used language that indicated they were being honest, confident, analytical and emotional. There were several results that were inconsistent with stereotypes of hackers, such as a relative absence of language indicating anger. The thematic analysis identified several themes relating to knowledge, skills acquisition, honesty legality and risk. Overall, this research demonstrates that there exists an established online community of hackers, which are likely to be encountered by any young person who becomes interested in cybersecurity and hacking. These communities may potentially act as an important source of social support and social identity for their members. Understanding the dynamics of these communities may better help us steer people towards legitimate cybersecurity careers, where their passion and skills can be used for societal good. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097097553

As a consequence, a complete and refined characterization of these adverse events necessitates a sociotechnical approach that takes into account the subjective lived experiences of the victims. Although researchers have examined such experiences pertaining to specific types of incidents, a broad understanding of the harmful impact of cybersecurity incidents requires an investigation of how people characterize and cope with these adverse experiences in general. To that end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 individuals who reported a variety of cybersecurity incidents, consequences, and coping mechanisms. We found that the experiences can be characterized along a bounded to fuzzy spectrum. As the majority of current cybersecurity efforts focus on relatively bounded incidents, we make the case that fuzzy incidents deserve similar attention because their harmful impacts are deeper and longer-lasting. Our insight can be applied to improve and personalize the delivery of cybersecurity interventions. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097094114

However, these connections expose the devices to possible attackers inside or outside the network, who may exploit software or hardware vulnerabilities to achieve malicious goals. To alleviate this issue, the use of defensive programming assertions can allow the behaviour of smart objects to be monitored and checked for correctness. Furthermore, open source intelligence tools, such as the Shodan search engine, provide features that could be leveraged to detect potential vulnerabilities.

This paper presents an automated penetration testing framework that employs deep reinforcement learning to automate the penetration testing process. We plan to use this framework mainly as a component of cybersecurity training activities, to provide guided learning for attack training by making use of the framework to suggest possible strategies. When adding support for actual penetration testing tools, the framework could also be used in defense training, by automatically recreating attacks in the training environment. In this paper we present our approach for automated penetration testing, which has two stages. First we use the Shodan search engine to collect relevant server data in order to build a realistic network topology, and employ multi-host multi-stage vulnerability analysis (MulVAL) to generate an attack tree for that topology; traditional search algorithms are used to find all the possible attack paths in that tree and to build a matrix representation as needed by deep reinforcement learning algorithms. As a second stage, we employ the Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) method to discover the most easy to exploit attack path from the possible candidates. This approach was evaluated by generating thousands of input scenarios, and DQN was able to find the optimal path with an accuracy of 0.86, while also providing valid solutions in the other cases. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097061652

The BoND-tree index scheme was recently developed to efficiently process so-called box queries on a large dataset in disk from such a vector data space. The index construction (insertion) and query algorithms were introduced in the original work. To maintain such an efficient index structure for a large dynamic dataset, one has to develop efficient and effective methods to support other operations including deletions, updates, and bulk loading. Although studies on deletions and bulk loading for the BoND-tree have been reported in early work, how to efficiently and effectively update the BoND-tree remains an open problem. In this paper, we first present a general update procedure which covers all scenarios including special cases for insertions and deletions. We then examine two approaches to updating the BoND-tree. The relevant algorithms and experimental evaluations are presented. Our study shows that using the bottom-up update method can provide improved efficiency, comparing to the traditional top-down update method, especially when the number of dimensions for a vector that need to be updated is small. On the other hand, our study also shows that the two update methods have a comparable effectiveness, which indicates that the bottom-up update method is generally more advantageous.

In modern doctrine and practice of international law, the issues of qualification of cyber warfare remain controversial. There are approaches to justify the application of international humanitarian and criminal law. The most justified, in our opinion, is the qualification of cyber warfare as a violation of the UNO Charter and the use of force, and in some cases - the crime of aggression. The substantive rules of the institution of international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime determine the special principles of this kind of cooperation, the criminalization of certain types of illegal acts, as well as institutional mechanisms and capacity building. The system of international combating cybercrime is based on the principles of technical neutrality, multi-stakeholderism (public-private partnerships), as well as the equivalence of human rights online and offline. In the future, cybercrime will be associated with the use of innovative technologies. As it has been established by the example of the Internet of things, the latest technology, as a general rule, is included in the scope of existing international agreements on cybercrime, but there is no special regulation for them. We propose formal consolidation of the provision on “emergent technologies” in the texts of international legal acts in the field of combating cybercrime.

The secrecy and security of an encryption key are thus crucial and fundamental: if the cryptographic key is compromised and known, everyone can decrypt a text encrypted according to the strongest encryption algorithm. As a consequence, several Key Management Systems (KMS) have been developed to easily support the management of cryptographic keys, whose number is constantly increasing, due to the amount of devices and communications that take place today, even in very restricted contexts. SEkey is a key management system developed targeting a distributed environment, where it is possible to identify a single central manager that acts as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) and many users that locally store and manage their own keys. Users, to a certain extent, can also work 'offline' without being always in direct communication with the central manager. SEkey is built leveraging the functionalities and physical properties of the SEcube™ Hardware Security Module (HSM). All the key values and critical information are stored inside the SEcube™ and never leave the device in clear, and all the cryptographic operations are performed by the SEcube™ itself.

User behavior and decisions are still a major part in the coping with these risks. We developed a model of optimal investment and human decisions with security measures, given that the effectiveness of each measure depends partly on the performance of the others. In an online experiment, participants classified events as malicious or non-malicious, based on the value of an observed variable. Prior to making the decisions, they had invested in three security measures-a firewall, an IDS or insurance. In three experimental conditions, maximal investment in only one of the measures was optimal, while in a fourth condition, participants should not have invested in any of the measures. A previous paper presents the analysis of the investment decisions. This paper reports users' classifications of events when interacting with these systems. The use of security mechanisms helped participants gain higher scores. Participants benefited in particular from purchasing IDS and/or Cyber Insurance. Participants also showed higher sensitivity and compliance with the alerting system when they could benefit from investing in the IDS. Participants, however, did not adjust their behavior optimally to the security settings they had chosen. The results demonstrate the complex nature of risk-related behaviors and the need to consider human abilities and biases when designing cyber security systems. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093927698

This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate.

Each period an expert receives a noisy private signal about whether an attack by the adversary is feasible. The expert wants to warn a decision maker while also maintaining credibility for future warnings, but unlike in a standard cheap talk game, the adversary can undermine the expert's credibility by delaying attack. While such delays increase “warning fatigue,” they also make the expert less tempted to exaggerate so as to avoid too many false alarms. We show that the net effect of a strategic adversary can be better incentive alignment between the expert and decision maker that benefits them both. Moreover, we show that sometimes the expert and decision maker benefit from the expert's ability to exaggerate, as this can induce more defensive action and more strategic delay. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089352113

Since data is becoming the main driver of business value, data quality and, specifically, data security are of paramount importance to companies. Various regulations related to data cybersecurity have been drawn up, such as the GDPR and the Cybersecurity Act, thus proving the importance placed on data cybersecurity by influential legislative institutions. Several standards related to security have emerged in recent years, most notably those of the ISO/IEC 27000 series. They are, however, focused on management systems and security infrastructure and ignore the security of the data itself. Other standards related to data quality, such as ISO 8000, also fail to address data security in depth. This paper, therefore, proposes a framework for the evaluation of data cybersecurity, consisting of a quality model, an evaluation process, and a tool for the visualization of the assessment results. This evaluation framework has been employed as the basis for a data cybersecurity certification scheme, which complements other certifiable standards related to data and security, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 8000.

This paper demonstrates a framework for uncovering vulnerabilities in MG controller algorithms that could be exploited by a cyber-capable adversary. Experimental results using a simulated MG developed in Matlab/Simulink show the controller is less performant when faced with various False Data Injection (FDI) attack scenarios. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097807763

Because of the higher maturity of civilian technologies for cybersecurity, this often involves adapting capabilities not initially intended for military use to new dual-use requirements, where concepts like operations, missions or Courses of Action (CoAs) shall be presented and aligned with the military doctrine. One of the main 'battle horses' in this transformation is to develop supporting systems able to facilitate the mission-centric acquisition of Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA), where the observations in the cyberspace shall be properly correlated, propagated and understood in the scope of planned/ongoing mission. But despite these CSA needs, there is a wide methodological gap in the lack of suitable validation and verification frameworks, which not only relies on the raising need for capabilities able to verify if the existing solutions meet the requirements to operate on military actions, but also to support the thorough development life-cycle of brand new cyber defence technologies. In these grounds, this research introduces a novel evaluation framework able to guide the evaluation of CSA related tools, for which three core validation concepts are discussed: Software, operational and application tests. They cover from the day-to-day implementation of the new capabilities, to their ability of facilitating that human decision-makers acquire a joint operational picture. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117540124

Recent trends in this area put forth a substantial body of literature on anomaly and attack detection on the top of public labelled datasets. Much of this literature blindly reuses existing datasets by overlooking the cybersecurity facets of the network traffic therein, in terms of its real impact on service availability and performance of operations. This paper addresses the representativeness of network traffic data provided by public datasets for cybersecurity research. To this aim, it proposes an initial exploration of the topic by means of a case study on Denial of Service (DoS) traffic of CICIDS2017, which is a recent dataset collected in a controlled environment that gained massive attention over the past two years. DoS traffic, which is available in CICIDS2017 in the form of packet data files, is replayed against a victim server in a controlled testbed. Measurements indicate that the DoS traffic, although somewhat relevant at network-level, has limited impact at application-level (i.e., by taking into account the performance of the victim under attack). The findings provide some key insights into the limitations of the data assessed in the study, paving the way for the construction of more rigorous datasets conceived with a multilayer perspective and that reflect actual traffic conditions under normative operations and disruptive attacks. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117539730

However, the rapid growth of the unsolicited and unwanted information needs to be addressed, raising the necessity of the technology to develop any effective anti-phishing methods. Design/methodology/approach: The primary intention of this research is to design and develop an approach for preventing phishing by proposing an optimization algorithm. The proposed approach involves four steps, namely preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and classification, for dealing with phishing e-mails. Initially, the input data set is subjected to the preprocessing, which removes stop words and stemming in the data and the preprocessed output is given to the feature extraction process. By extracting keyword frequency from the preprocessed, the important words are selected as the features. Then, the feature selection process is carried out using the Bhattacharya distance such that only the significant features that can aid the classification are selected. Using the selected features, the classification is done using the deep belief network (DBN) that is trained using the proposed fractional-earthworm optimization algorithm (EWA). The proposed fractional-EWA is designed by the integration of EWA and fractional calculus to determine the weights in the DBN optimally. Findings: The accuracy of the methods, naive Bayes (NB), DBN, neural network (NN), EWA-DBN and fractional EWA-DBN is 0.5333, 0.5455, 0.5556, 0.5714 and 0.8571, respectively. The sensitivity of the methods, NB, DBN, NN, EWA-DBN and fractional EWA-DBN is 0.4558, 0.5631, 0.7035, 0.7045 and 0.8182, respectively. Likewise, the specificity of the methods, NB, DBN, NN, EWA-DBN and fractional EWA-DBN is 0.5052, 0.5631, 0.7028, 0.7040 and 0.8800, respectively. It is clear from the comparative table that the proposed method acquired the maximal accuracy, sensitivity and specificity compared with the existing methods. Originality/value: The e-mail phishing detection is performed in this paper using the optimization-based deep learning networks. The e-mails include a number of unwanted messages that are to be detected in order to avoid the storage issues. The importance of the method is that the inclusion of the historical data in the detection process enhances the accuracy of detection. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088243149

The framework integrates a large variety of contemporary cybersecurity tools but also provides additional features aiming to facilitate novice users to get an overview of existing threats through simple tutorials, extensive explanatory material and a complete lessons-learned section. One of the possible areas in which the project can demonstrate its potential is in the protection of online voting solutions for small companies or governmental institutions. Scytl has developed an online voting solution that has been used in many private and governmental elections. The solution follows the principles of security by design, however infrastructure security must also be considered and ensured.

The blockchain is an immutable ledger which records the transaction in a decentralized manner that ensures high security. Blockchain-based applications are popular in numerous fields like financial services, cryptocurrencies, cybersecurity, supply chain, health care, E-Governance, asset management, Internet of Things (IoT), and so on. In order to validate a transaction within a ledger, blockchain uses the concept of consensus. Consensus guarantees fault tolerance, reliability and high security of the blockchain systems. The most widely used consensus algorithms in the modern blockchains are the Proof of Work (PoW), the Proof of Stake (PoS), the Proof of Activity(PoA) and the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance(PBFT). In this work, we conduct a performance evaluation of these four consensus algorithms using Naive implementation of a blockchain network.

As a key component in cybersecurity, access control is used to mitigate malicious access to sensitive information. To help students master the access control concepts, we developed a 2D educational game titled ""Temple of Treasures""that aims to teach Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Access Control List (ACL) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) in Unix/Linux Systems via a fun and interactive environment. The Unity3D game engine is used for game development and the game can be deployed to multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, and web. Player information and in-game assessment data are saved on the cloud through GameSparks for analysis. The game story is centered around a group of adventurers in search of gold. The player is stuck in a temple and has to explore the temple for escape routes. The game has three levels, where level one focuses on DAC, level two focuses on ACL and the last level is for MAC. The player has to explore the temple and gain knowledge on targeted concepts to unlock the gate to the next level. Three in-game assessments have been implemented to provide immediate feedback for students. The UI Accessibility Plugin (UAP) is used to make the game accessible to visually impaired players. To scientifically measure the effectiveness of the game, we developed pre-test, post-test, survey, and focus group protocols. The game has been used in the Operating Systems class as a homework assignment at North Carolina A&T State University in spring 2020. This poster will present the game design and development process, the detailed evaluation plan, and our initial classroom experience. This portable and self-contained game will make it easy to share with other faculty engaged in cyber security teaching and research. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092155856

In 2020, many school systems are still trying to figure out how to meet the learning requirements of bringing Computer Science (CS) into every primary and secondary classroom. As state department of education offices throughout the United States are trying to support the initiative and have started adding CS requirements to standardized testing, the lack of professional development (PD) for educators has been forgotten. How does a physical education teacher, a special education teacher, a foreign language teacher, and a history teacher bring CS concepts into their classrooms? This immediately caused a high demand for Computer Science (CS) professional development for primary and secondary teachers. Some school systems did not even fully understand what CS was, so they were unable to identify PD needs, evaluate PD options, or track their educator's inclusion of it. Over the past two years, I have conducted Computer Science PD sessions for educators in three formats (one year of weekend sessions, one year mentoring through computer clubs, and one year undergraduate CS courses) of with varying lengths of commitment by the participants, who came from different backgrounds. Participants were from the K-12 areas of Math, Technology Education, English, Special education, and English Language Learners. A side-by-side comparison of these sessions based on different categories such as targeted grade level, workshop durations, prior educator knowledge area, curriculum development information, training tools, and lessons learned will be provided in this poster. The sessions were structured using participatory design [3] and traditional college undergraduate online course work. Initial pilot results were collected through a survey prior to receiving the PD. These early results show that K-12 teachers in non-career and technical classrooms believe that CS is just programming or do not know how to apply CS concepts to their subject matter. The results further show that many of the K-12 teachers felt that the majority of existing PD simply provided lesson plans [4] versus teaching them CS competencies to allow them the creativity to develop their own lesson plans and to support their students CS questions. In a few cases, for example pilot participants were surprised to learn that CS does not always include programming. We are currently using conjecture maps [5] and data sorting to process and analyze the data from our three formats. The conjecture mapping will aid in seeing where we can improve to ensure that K-12 teachers in our service area are comfortable with CS topic inclusion. We will also be able to duplicate a successful approach for cybersecurity topics in the future, as that is now also being added by stated department of education boards within the United States. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092135068

Since the modern wind farms are integrated with active sensors and controllable actuators, coupled with the legacy infrastructure, for wide-area applications, it is imperative to address the associated cybersecurity challenges in the context of SCADA-based wind farm infrastructure. In this paper, we present a testbed-based performance evaluation of attack-resilient control for wind farm SCADA system (WFSS) that detects different cyber attacks on the SCADA measurement, and provide necessary mitigation using the forecast information. Specifically, we have utilized the real-time wind power forecast, as a redundant measurement, and timing property of SCADA measurements to develop model-based anomaly detector. Once an anomaly is detected, wind power forecast information is leveraged, as a part of a mitigation system, for monitoring and control purposes. We have leveraged the resources available at Iowa State University's PowerCyber testbed to implement cyberattacks and later validate the performance of attack resilient control.

Advances in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are rapidly changing the nature of the power grid. Moreover, the accommodation of these new technologies by the legacy grid requires that an increasing number of devices be Internet connected so as to allow for sensor and actuator information to be collected, transmitted, and processed. With the wide adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of smart grid devices that can potentially affect the stability, reliability, and resilience of the power grid need to be carefully examined and addressed. This is especially true in situations in which smart grid devices are deployed with default configurations or without reasonable protections against malicious activities. While much work has been done to characterize the vulnerabilities associated with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, this paper demonstrates that similar vulnerabilities associated with the newer class of IoT smart grid devices are becoming a concern. Specifically, this paper first performs an evaluation of such devices using the Shodan platform and text processing techniques to analyze a potential vulnerability involving the lack of password protection. This work further explores several Shodan search terms that can be used to identify additional smart grid components that can be evaluated in terms of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

It represents a mindset shift from protection and avoidance of adverse cyber events and the development of fail-safe systems to anticipation and planning for adverse cyber events, including the development of systems that are safe-to-fail. At the national level, the adoption and incorporation of resilience thinking in the national cybersecurity strategies is given impetus by several factors, including the inevitability of both known and unknown cyber risks, as well as the demands for holistic resilience from multilateral frameworks, including the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development agenda, the New Urban Agenda, and the Sendai framework. This paper presents findings from a review of the national cybersecurity strategies of several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The review is framed along several lines of inquiry that explore the extent to which the countries incorporate whole-of-society cyber resilience in their national cybersecurity strategies. While most countries give recognition of the importance of cyber resilience, few countries provide a detailed operationalization of cyber resilience in their strategies. Not surprisingly, the pattern, that countries with higher cybersecurity maturity have a more nuanced articulation of cyber resilience, is noted from the review. However, some countries with lower cybersecurity maturity are noted to provide more apparent avenues for the engagement of civil society stakeholders, including third-sector organizations, in the cybersecurity strategies. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097643441

An accurate passive Operating System (OS) fingerprinting plays a critical role in effective network management and cybersecurity protection. Passive fingerprinting doesn't send probes that introduce extra load to the network and hence it has a clear advantage over active fingerprinting since it also reduces the risk of triggering false alarms. This paper proposes and evaluates an advanced classification approach to passive OS fingerprinting by leveraging state-of-the-art classical machine learning and deep learning techniques. Our controlled experiments on benchmark data, emulated and realistic traffic is performed using two approaches. Through an Oracle-based machine learning approach, we found that the underlying TCP variant is an important feature for predicting the remote OS. Based on this observation, we develop a sophisticated tool for OS fingerprinting that first predicts the TCP flavor using passive traffic traces and then uses this prediction as an input feature for another machine learning algorithm for predicting the remote OS from passive measurements. This paper takes the passive fingerprinting problem one step further by introducing the underlying predicted TCP variant as a distinguishing feature. In terms of accuracy, we empirically demonstrate that accurately predicting the TCP variant has the potential to boost the evaluation performance from 84% to 94% on average across all our validation scenarios and across different types of traffic sources. We also demonstrate a practical example of this potential, by increasing the performance to 91.3% on average using a tool for TCP variant prediction in an emulated setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the potential for using the knowledge of the TCP variant to significantly boost the accuracy of passive OS fingerprinting. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093841531

This rapid growth is primarily driven by the potential of such smart applications to significantly improve safety on public roads and offer new possibilities for modern transportation concepts. Such indispensable applications typically require wireless connectivity between the vehicles and their surroundings, i.e. roadside infrastructure and cloud services. Nevertheless, such connectivity to external networks exposes the internal systems of individual vehicles to threats from remotely-launched attacks. In this realm, it is highly crucial to identify any misbehavior of the software components which might occur owing to either these threats or even software/hardware malfunctioning. In this paper, we introduce AutoSec, a host-based anomaly detection algorithm which relies on observing four timing parameters of the executed software components to accurately detect malicious behavior on the operating system level. To this end, AutoSec formulates the task of detecting anomalistic executions as a clustering problem. Specifically, AutoSec devises a hybrid clustering algorithm for grouping a set of collected timing traces resulted from executing the legitimate code. During the runtime, AutoSec simply classifies a certain execution as an anomaly, if its timing parameters are distant enough from the boundaries of the predefined clusters. To show the effectiveness of AutoSec, we collected timing traces from a testbed composed of a set of real and virtual control units communicating over a CAN bus. We show that using our proposed AutoSec, compared to baseline methods, we can identify up to 21% less false positives and 18% less false negatives. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092713988

In particular, one of the most harmful practices refers to malicious users that act as advertisers to deliver unsafe ads. The goal of these ads is to compromise the security of the users that receive those ads. This practice is referred to as Malvertising.

There are many excellent engineering tools already in widespread use, but many organizations have not yet integrated and linked them into an overarching ""campaign plan""that connects those tactical actions such as process hazard analysis, threat modeling, and probabilistic methods to the desired strategic outcome of secure and resilient systems. This article presents the combined systems security engineering process (CSSEP) as a way to fill that gap. Systems theory provides the theoretical foundation on which CSSEP is built. CSSEP is structured as a control loop in which the engineering team is the controller of the design process. The engineering team needs to have an explicit process model on how systems should be secured, and a control algorithm that determines what control actions should be selected. CSSEP's process model postulates that security is best achieved by a balance of cybersecurity, cyber resiliency, defensibility, and recoverability and that control is best established by developing security constraints versus attempting to find every vulnerability. CSSEP then transmits those security constraints as requirements into the design process. The design process used in CSSEP is the prioritized integrated cyber assessment methodology (PICAM). PICAM includes four phases that are looped including mission analysis, cooperative testing, adversarial assessment, and secure design. Feedback is then presented back to the engineering team using the probabilistic mission risk analysis (PMRA) supported by test data to close the control loop. CSSEP identifies the major functions needed to do effective aircraft cybersecurity and provides a flexible framework as the ""missing link""to connect the strategic and tactical levels of aircraft cybersecurity. © 2020 Modern Technology Solutions, Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109809530

However, both finding the critical vulnerabilities and then allocating security measures in a cost-efficient way become challenging when the number of vulnerabilities and measures is large. This paper proposes a framework that can be used once this is the case. In our framework, the attacker exploits security vulnerabilities to gain control over some of the sensors and actuators. The critical vulnerabilities are those that are not complex to exploit and can lead to a large impact on the physical world through the compromised sensors and actuators. To find these vulnerabilities efficiently, we propose an algorithm that uses the nondecreasing properties of the impact and complexity functions and properties of the security measure allocation problem to speed up the search. Once the critical vulnerabilities are located, the security measure allocation problem reduces to an integer linear program. Since integer linear programs are NP-hard in general, we reformulate this problem as a problem of minimizing a linear set function subject to a submodular constraint. A polynomial time greedy algorithm can then be applied to obtain a solution with guaranteed approximation bound. The applicability of our framework is demonstrated on a control system used for regulation of temperature within a building. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055057291

Firstly, the closed and fixed operating environment is utilized to establish and maintain a white list of legal processes in the cloud security server. Thereafter, the malware detection agent is installed in SM, and all operating processes are enumerated by it. The hash code of each process can be calculated as its identity and submitted to the cloud security server. The SM with malware could be identified by comparing it with the whitelist.

Modular Open architecture security requirements such as those for Anti-Tamper and Cybersecurity need to be an integral part of the MOSA lifecycle. Also, a primary concern of businesses is to maintain competitive advantage by means of protecting their proprietary data. In essence, MOSA systems are characterized by defining common interfaces and not the functionality within the system itself, maintaining proprietary data protected within the boundaries of each module. Is this sufficient to provide horizontal protection across plug-and-play MOSA systems? To begin studying questions such as this, this paper utilizes Systems Thinking methodologies to explore the US Department of Defense (DoD) method to MOSA and Systems Security Engineering (SSE). The authors introduce several systems thinking methodologies to scope the problem and identify the benefits of incorporating SSE into the MOSA lifecycle. Using systemic tools, the authors identify the stakeholders that influence and are affected by both MOSA and SSE, determine the system boundary, describe the relationships between all components within the system, explore several shaping forces that have brought MOSA to its present state and determine the proposed value added by designing a trusted and secure MOSA. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105271319

The strategy of persistent engagement implies the constant conduct of cyber operations that do not reach the level of an armed conflict and combining purely defensive activities with offense. Such strategy is designed to prevent US rivals from carrying out malicious actions in cyberspace and to preserve strategic advantages of the United States by imposing additional costs on opponents and creating tactical friction for them. According to experts, persistent engagement perfectly suits the unique characteristics of cyberspace (interconnectedness and the condition of constant contact), unlike a strategy of deterrence that is suitable for traditional areas of military operations. Nevertheless, the US leadership is not ready to abandon the cyber deterrence strategy, and it is looking for ways to conceptually combine the two strategies. The paper presents the key characteristics of persistent engagement, some of which are: 1) cyber operations do not reach the level of an armed conflict; 2) persistent engagement is not an armed conflict; 3) creating ""tactical friction"" and imposing costs on US opponents; 4) preventive defense. Expert opinions on the prospects of persistent engagement are presented and analyzed. The paper demonstrates the analysis potential advantages and drawbacks of this approach. American specialists expect that persistent engagement will lead to an automatic formation of criteria for acceptable behavior in the process of strategic competition. Among the obvious drawbacks of the analyzed approach, one can single out a possible international escalation due to its application. The author analyzes the transformation of the “conceptual” status of cyberspace and the institutional changes, caused by this new strategic approach. The conclusions regarding the prospects for this strategy are ambiguous. Its effectiveness, safety and risks will become known only with time during the actual application of this strategy and the accumulation of empirical experience. The relevance of the work is due to the current strategic situation between the United States and Russia. Understanding the United States' approaches to cybersecurity and the key strategic changes in them is crucial not only to formulate Russia's cybersecurity policy, but also to build a constructive dialogue with the United States on cybersecurity issues. © 2020 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

The mechanics of providing these services (e.g., activities like processing satellite imagery for defense and civil applications, analyzing patient data for diagnosing acute ailments, ensuring uneventful working of unmanned vehicles and big data analytics for sustaining smart cities) all require unprecedented data acquisition, storage, computation and communication. Driven by the need to achieve agility, intelligence and high performance at lower cost and improve outcomes, these systems are increasingly relying on advanced methods and technologies. Trends show the prevalence of IoT for data collection, multi-cloud computing for storage and analytics and virtualization of communication components. The increasing sophistication of technology also increases susceptibility of these systems to cyberattacks. The overarching objective of the work presented in this paper is to show the feasibility and usefulness of AI-based hierarchical sparse deep neural network models for providing security to data in motion.

The increased use of digital methods and technologies in areas, e.g., order management, supply chain, and analytics lead to secondary and often unexpected consequences in operations. This, in turn, leads to changes to how key roles in an industrial facility are defined, from process operators to operating and improvement engineers. Although many define digital transformation as the introduction or integration of digital technology to transform functions and business processes, implications also exist for process definition and organization design. Industrial transformation is a more specific term, focusing specifically on technology-driven change to industrial operations. The increased emphasis on the security of data transfer and access to production systems has also led to increased demands on operations personnel. Some of these demands, e.g., cybersecurity, have resulted in changes to the definitions for key roles, from process operators to operating and improvement engineers. The competency models and other tools that government, standards groups, consultants, and academia have developed must be further tested and validated in the real world.

However, how to design a highly realistic scenario under the condition of limited resources is a classic problem. This research revolves around three key challenges in solving this difficult problem. In this paper, we first model the network penetration scenario in the real-world as a multi-step, multi-host infiltration process combined with multiple vulnerabilities. Then the design is performed by making use of attack graph techniques which are capable of describing the dependency between vulnerabilities in a complex network information system. Finally, with the support of a cybersecurity testbed which is born to an experimental platform with the ability to quickly reproduce and reconfigure a large-scale network, we implement the entire design. In this study, the experiment was conducted in the form of an intranet attack-defense network penetration competition, named as Explore-Exploit. The longest penetration path in the experiment included four hosts and combined with three vulnerabilities, along with a service, which achieved the motivated goal. Compared to the existing competitions, Explore-Exploit contains more elements, such as network topology exploring, intranet lateral movement, data asset discovery and more. It's proved that Explore-Exploit is more faithful to the authenticity of the real-world network penetration scenario. © Copyright 2020, Institute of Information Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This demand was created and is driven by the ever-increasing rate of technology implementation in mission-critical roles throughout industry, governments, and society. Due, in part, to this need and for a variety of other reasons, numerous non-collegiate cybersecurity offerings have been launched [2]. Many of these programs promise to offer the education and career prospects of a 2-year or 4-year degree in a matter of weeks or months. While the focus is somewhat different and these programs do not offer the well-rounded background of a collegiate degree, they do raise a question of the comparative efficacy of different approaches for providing cybersecurity instruction. This work seeks to answer the question of how educators can best meet the growing demand for cybersecurity professionals. It compares the learning outcomes of a cybersecurity course offered in a traditional three credit hour classroom lecture setting over one academic semester to an immersive 80-hour workshop environment offered as two 40-hour weeks of instruction, lab work and facilitated assignments. The paper describes the study which includes comparative assessment of students in both environments. The work considers both the outcomes achieved and student satisfaction with the learning process. The study includes pre- and post-tests for both formats. Also, students in both environments are surveyed before and after the cybersecurity education experience to evaluate students' perceptions of the education environment's impact on their performance.

This is following the growth of the field in both industry and research. While past research discusses what does and doesn't work, from the perspective of faculty and the department, they leave out an important viewpoint by not including the perspective of the student researcher. In this work, the authors fill that knowledge gap. This work-in-progress tells the details of an undergraduate security project from the perspective of the student, a rising junior at Wentworth Institute of Technology, an undergraduate-centric institution. The presented case study will show insight into the mind of an undergraduate as they approach and explore a new field through extracurricular research with a supervising professor. Before beginning the project, the undergraduate researcher had experience in digital logic and programming, but little experience in more advanced topics. While working closely with the academic supervisor, the student spent significant amounts of time learning the necessary technical skills. Specifically, the student worked towards recreating a FPGA security technique called Moats and Bridges from published research in the computer architecture security community [1]. FPGA logic blocks are capable of attacking co-resident logic blocks via side-channel attacks to reveal the inner-workings of the victim logic, as demonstrated in existing research in the community. The Moats and Bridges technique changes the synthesis process and provides isolation to logic modules. The synthesis process could otherwise lead to placement of logic blocks that breeds vulnerabilities and back channels. The work-in-progress discussed here will primarily focus on understanding and implementing the Moats and Bridges techniques and technology. Through the research, the activities provided insight towards the more fundamental principle of FPGA security and provided technical tasks for the undergraduate. The goal of the work is to inform undergraduate students of difficulties that may be faced when researching material beyond the scope of their knowledge. A secondary goal is to present techniques to increase fluency with resources and results of the research conducted. Lastly, supervisors can gain insight into how best to prepare and support their researchers, particularly outside of a class or graduate environment. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095789215

CPS refers to the integration of digital and internetworked components, and physical devices in systems that affect nearly everyone in society. These devices are always connected to the internet. This connectivity gives CPS devices the capability of being in continuous monitoring mode where data and information are delivered to device owners through a proxy server. These capabilities open up all kinds of security issues for a device that has been built with such features with little regard for security considerations. At present, many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduates are not fully comprehending the security impact of device connectivity. STEM students are graduating without awareness of cybersecurity or cyber-physical systems security issues/challenges and without being aware of the security issues related to algorithms or systems they are designing. This state of affairs is a consequence of the fact that security awareness is currently not part of the curriculum. In this paper we highlight a cybersecurity program at Boise State University that includes an introductory class on CPS security. Some topics included in this course are: information technology versus operation technology, cryptography, industrial control systems, smart grid, CAN bus, risk assessment, red versus blue team, and Kali Linux. In this paper, we provide examples on how students' knowledge of CPS security changes over the course of the program, how students are supported in and out of the classroom towards advancing their knowledge in this field. We also highlight the impact that project-based and team coordinated learning can have on increasing students' understanding of the fundamentals of CPS security. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095786762

These are utilized as a basis of analysis for future improvement. The area of Cyber Ethics is a critical, relatively immature, interdisciplinary, and dynamic field that requires an understanding of ethical frameworks across history and an understanding of the technical details of cyber actions in order to make judgments on the ethical implications of such actions. This course has sought to extend ethical principles to the cyber domain while introducing many of the legal and policy considerations appropriate. Through the use of vibrant in class discussion, research and presentations, and a final project, students learned about, explored, and sought to discern the ethical implications of cybersecurity within the context of society, especially as it pertains to military and law enforcement. Student feedback validated that the course challenged them, offered them an opportunity to present their views, and extended what they had learned in their classic ethics class into the cyber domain.

Preparing qualified students to satisfy the current and future work force requirement in cybersecurity is deemed essential. One of the main cybersecurity domain challenges is its interdisciplinary nature that involves scientists, engineers, technologists, and business teams. It is almost impossible in real life to mitigate threats and defend against attacks without assembling teams and qualified team members with skills in all the aforementioned disciplines. This paper aims at presenting the plan and procedures required for creating an project based interdisciplinary course at cybersecurity of frontier technologies between the College of Engineering, College of Science, and College of Business Administration. The course objective is to bring students from the three disciplines into a multidisciplinary experience that aids students at replicating real life projects. Instructors from all three disciplines guide the students during the course work and supervise the project activities. The fifteen-week course can adopt different types of cybersecurity systems and provide a framework for students' collaboration on a practical project. The framework consists of four modules divided between the three disciplines: 1) project scope, system integration, and teamwork incorporation; 2) system engineering, cybersecurity design, and application development; 3) system cybersecurity algorithms, data collection, organization, and analytics; 4) system business planning, cybersecurity applications operations implementation, and maintenance. The paper also presents an example for an IoT based project to apply the framework and show the projected course model in developing the IoT project. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095768974

The material and platform, deployed at the University of South Carolina, are also used by other institutions to support regular academic courses, self-pace training of professional IT staff, and workshops across the country. The private cloud is used to deploy scenarios consisting of high-speed networks (up to 50 Gbps), multi-domain environments emulating internetworks, and infrastructures under cyber-attacks using live traffic. For regular academic courses, the virtual laboratories have been adopted by institutions in different states to supplement theoretical material with hands-on activities in IT, electrical engineering, and computer science programs. Topics include Local Area Networks (LANs), congestion-control algorithms, performance tools used to emulate wide area networks (WANs) and their attributes (packet loss, reordering, corruption, latency, jitter, etc.), data transfer applications for high-speed networks, queueing delay and buffer size in routers and switches, active monitoring of multi-domain systems, high-performance cybersecurity tools such as Zeek's intrusion detection systems, and others. The training platform has been also used by IT professionals from more than 30 states, for self-pace training. The material provides training on topics beyond general-purpose networks, which are usually overlooked by practitioners and researchers. Additionally, the platform has supported workshops organized across the country. Workshops are co-organized with organizations that operate large backbone networks connecting research centers and national laboratories, and colleges and universities conducting teaching and research activities. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095766281

The last two years of the NSF grant writing model has proven successful in assisting both experienced and inexperienced colleges with achieving a larger or first NSF ATE grant. NSF feedback indicates that mentored projects (both from Mentor Connect and ATE2YC/Mentor Up) are achieving better success in receiving funding than non-mentored projects. The project team remains committed to continuous project evaluation and quality control and the model evolves with feedback. Upcoming innovations expected in 2020 include a revised agenda with more small group activities at the workshop and less seat time and a second summer workshop focused on mentoring cybersecurity and IT proposals. Also, as noted, due to the COVID19 outbreak, the June 15-17, 2020 workshop has been changed to a virtual workshop using zoom and other online tools.

Many Master's level programs include courses that address these skills in an attempt to provide a well-rounded program of study. However, undergraduates who are in the practitioner's world have other alternatives to gain these skills. These individuals can gain various certifications, such as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) or the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM). Due to a perceived gap between academics and field knowledge, it appears that academic programs may not fully consider the very specific competencies of C-Suite members (e.g. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)) since field certification may be the only validation of such skills. Therefore, a framework from degree to industry employment acceptance is needed. To this end, the current study suggests the use of a framework in which to examine and compare C-Suite competencies versus academic preparations. Ultimately, this framework will assist researchers in examining the actual, current job tasks of C-Suite members. Since the CISO position is new to the industry, becoming a common job title within only the last few years, the reporting structure for the CISO varies widely and various organizations have differing expectations of the position [1]. Therefore, the initial phases of this study focus solely upon this position as the starting benchmark. This paper explores historical aspects of the workforce skills gap in the area of computer security while providing survey validation results from Phase I of this project. This pilot investigation invited faculty (n=5; 24% response rate) who are both practitioners and academicians to support this examination and the acceptance of said framework. Demographic data includes a comparison between degree attainment and employment position, and asked respondents to compare academic preparatory tasks to that of required job market skills-those skills collected from the literature and employment position descriptions taken from Yahoo, Google, Monster, Indeed, and other HR-advertised locations. Lastly, respondents were asked to rank these skills by importance to establish the framework baseline of comparison. Future phases of this project will include a larger sample and Delphi results gathered during the ranking phase of this effort. Recommendations for future program designs will be provided upon the completion of the overall study. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095752619

Typical topics in such courses are the layered model of data communication, specifically the OSI seven-layered model, Internet routing, communication standards, protocols and technologies, and learning methods used to design the network and send data over the network in a secure manner. In the last decades, the data communication and applications have grown and become ubiquitous in both industry and people's everyday life, alongside with increasing data rates and emerging broadband technologies, i.e., Internet access technologies. The ability to connect with other computers, remote systems, and mobile devices is also contributing to the increased number of applications in our daily life. Consequently, courses related to computer networks become imperative for students in engineering technology programs, as they are essential in preparing the students for the level of technology required on the current job market. However, it is challenging to keep up in classrooms with today's industry requirements for graduates in terms of both content and hands-on activities. Firstly, the course content should be updated with emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, 5G, cybersecurity, etc. The knowledge of emerging communication technologies is crucial for student's awareness of new trends and to prepare them for the industry, especially telecommunication and Information Technology (IT) sectors. Secondly, the course should cover hands-on activities that are aligned with the theoretical upgrades introduced in the class. Such activities should include the use of network analyzer tools for network analysis and communications protocol development, as well as a network simulator to provide students with a technology development environment for network design, troubleshooting, and protocol modeling in a simulated environment. Following these considerations, this paper presents the way the Data Network Communications course was updated as part of an overall curriculum revision in an Electrical Engineering Technology program. The paper discusses the course topics, the course objectives, and the software tools introduced to support the hands-on activities in the class, including the Wireshark software tool, for network troubleshooting, profiling network traffic and analyzing packets.

The European Union sees collaboration and the establishment of competence networks as indispensable for securing its digital economy, infrastructures, society, and democracy, and preserving its competitive advantages. Four pilot projects were launched in 2019 within the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme aiming at establishing and operating a pilot for a Cybersecurity Competence Network to develop and implement common cybersecurity research and innovation roadmap, to develop and validate an appropriate governance model of the network. The research team of one of the pilots, ECHO, conducted a comprehensive study to identify governance needs, priorities, and models, analysing for that purpose norms, existing networks, and academic sources and interviewing key stakeholders. This paper presents the results of the review of the academic literature conducted to identify and prioritise requirements and support the design of a governance model of a network in the field of cybersecurity. First, it outlines different approaches to creating and governing a Collaborative Networked Organisation (CNO). Then, the authors analyse a variety of CNO governance models and identify possible arrangements for the establishment of collaboration. Further, they examine the collaborative and absorptive capacity of networked organisations and discuss the issues of organisational resilience and value systems alignment in CNOs, with a focus on trust relationships and trustworthiness as one of the crucial factors of success. The paper concludes by summarising the key features of CNO governance models and elaborating on how the identified best practices can be applied in the development of a governance model of a cybersecurity network. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090568894

AI-based cybercrime becomes a product of technological development, posing a threat to national security, public security, and the protection of citizens' personal property rights and privacy rights. In particular, the derivation of cybercrime that follows the development of science and technology leads to a qualitative change in the patterns of cybercrimes, expanding the scope and depth of the harm caused by cybercrime, producing a series of impacts on the conviction rules of traditional criminal law in China. The defects such as the features of the principal offender being weakened, the definition of the responsibility for accessory to the principal offender not clear, the narrow scope applicable to one-sided accomplice are present. To this end, in the era where AI and cybercrime have deep integration, given the derivative trend of AI-based cybercrime, it is urgent to adjust the focus of criminal strategy against cybercrime. The horizontal docking of domestic substantive law and legal interpretation is performed to achieve a gradient balance between judicial interpretation and legislative amendment and adjust the criminal boundary in cybercrime evaluation, thereby changing the current high threshold of conviction in the cybercrime governance and late launch of punishment power. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087385895

This survey includes a brief overview of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and their relationship to the Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Industry 4.0 terminology. The cybersecurity features of eight data diodes are compared, and the cyber attack surface, attack scenarios, and mitigations of a typical PV system are discussed. After assessing cybersecurity, the economic considerations to purchase a data diode are considered. At 13.19 cents/kWh, the sale of 227,445 kWh is needed to fund one 30,000 data diode. On average, a military installation, similar to a small city, requires approximately 48,516 kWh every hour and could fund a 30,000 data diode in 4.7 hours. Comparatively, a 25 kW community-scale PV system costing 75,000 and generating an excess of 20 kW annually (approx. 36,000 kWh), requires 6.3 years to fund a 30,000 data diode.

Like any environment, UNP's cyber environment is vulnerable to security risks which dampen the privacy and safety of stakeholders, the security of assets, and the confidentiality of business proceedings. To proactively address these and other potential risks, this study reviewed existing risk management frameworks used across governments and selected one to be utilized for improving organizational cyber policies and risk mitigation procedures and practices - PRISM, a model to identify and implement cybersecurity risk management tailored towards the problems and needs of the university. Results showed that at least half of the risk areas have poor preparedness level, stemming from the lack of institutionalization of knowledge and solutions, assessing unusual behavior, and proactive and enterprise risk management. Most risk areas seemed to be prioritized, had allocated resources, and has reactive risk management in place. GAP Analysis was also conducted in conjunction with the results of PRISM assessment to better steer the university in the right direction. The study concluded that PRISM is a tool that aided the university in laying down a formalized groundwork for cybersecurity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087396740

To reduce the risk of the software being exposed to such threats the software testers need to identify appropriate controls to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Since there is a constraint on the revenues and the time that these testers can utilize for carrying out security checks, they need to prioritize the vulnerabilities and select those which have maximum severity. Thus, prioritizing the criticality and severity of vulnerabilities to fix such flaws is the primary step in this direction. Taking this into consideration, the purpose of this analysis is to develop a method for determining the relative vulnerability of sensitive network protection services to attacks.

More than a static position, we show a dynamic positioning of our respondents between surrender and defender of their online privacy that depends on: perceived personal susceptibility to digital threat; self-efficacy; catalytic information; social vs. institutional space; type of shared information; and age.

Usually, IoT devices have limited resources and Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are being used to interconnect such devices. Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is one of the preferred routing protocols for this type of network, since it was specially developed for LLNs, also known as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN). In this paper the most well-known routing attacks against 6LoWPAN networks were studied and implemented through simulation, conducting a behavioral analysis of network components (resources, topology, and data traffic) under attack condition. In order to achieve a better understanding on how attacks in 6LoWPAN work, we first conducted a study on 6LoWPAN networks and RPL protocol functioning. Furthermore, we also studied a series of well-known routing attacks against this type of Wireless Sensor Networks and these attacks were then simulated using Cooja simulator provided by Contiki operating system.

However, new capabilities in networked cyber-physical systems demand more complex infrastructure and algorithms and often lead to new security flaws and operational risks that increase the attack surface area exponentially. The interconnected nature of Industry 4.0-driven operations and the pace of digital transformation mean that cyberattacks can have far more extensive effects than ever before. Based on that, the core ideas of this paper are driven by the observation that cybersecurity is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0. Having this in mind, we propose CryptoFactory - a forward-looking design of a layered-based architecture that can be used as a starting point for building secure and privacy-preserving smart factories. CryptoFactory aims to change the security outlook in smart manufacturing by discussing a set of fundamental requirements and functionality that modern factories should support in order to be resistant to both internal and external attacks. To this end, CryptoFactory first focuses on how to build trust relationships between the hardware devices in the factory. Then, we look on how to use several cryptographic approaches to allow IoT devices to securely collect, store and share their data while we also touch upon the emerging topic of secure and privacy-preserving communication and collaboration between manufacturing environments and value chains. Finally, we look into the problem of how to perform privacy-preserving analytics by leveraging Trusted Execution Environments and the promising concept of Functional Encryption. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089274465

IoT systems have become essential in our daily lives, as they are usable for various application areas. They are usually small, connected with other systems, and perform a wide range of tasks. They are subject to multiple constraints in terms of performance, power consumption, chip area, etc. Attackers often target such devices as they are in constant interaction with each other or connected to the internet during private data processing. Cybersecurity, thus, plays a vital role in the design of IoT systems. Hence, designing secure IoT systems is a complex task, particularly for designers with limited security know-how. Security measures increase both computation time and power consumption, creating a conflict between these constraints, which must be solved by the designers. Balancing these constraints is a highly complex task. In this paper, we propose a new approach for considering security constraints in design space exploration, including possible security attacks on embedded systems. The method simplifies the consideration of security requirements at the start of the system design. We introduce a security attack based design space exploration framework, capable of finding the optimal design for an IoT system, based on its architectural, behavioral, and security attack description.

To accomplish this goal, a comparative analysis of the two cybersecurity models was conducted whereby relevant evidence was extracted from existing information. Findings revealed that the IT security management function is too sensitive to be left in the hands of a third-party cloud services provider. Rather, the function ought to be managed internally to minimize the potential attack vector as much as possible. However, despite our primary finding, we note that when cloud-based apps, operations, and data are involved, the SECaaS model is considered to be the most suitable IT security management approach. In particular, SECaaS outperforms the premise-based security model in the following core dimensions: cost-savings, ease of management, scalability and agility, expertise, constant updates, and cost- effective compliance. In our current research, we document the differences between the on-premises IT security and SECaaS models, and justify the case for SECaaS as the most suitable approach primarily focusing on the suite of cloud-based cybersecurity tools packaged with Microsoft 365 Business. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087625044

This adoption introduces new vulnerabilities and entry points for hackers to launch attacks. Advanced cybersecurity threats with automated capabilities are increasing in such sectors as finance, health, grid, retail, government, telecommunications, transportation, etc. These cyber threats are also increasing in railways and, therefore, it needs for cybersecurity measures to predict, detect and respond these threats. The cyber kill chain (CKC) model is a widely used model to detect cyber-attacks and it consists of seven stages/chains; breaking the chain at an early stage will help the defender stop the adversary’s malicious actions. Due to lack of real cybersecurity data, this research simulates cyber-attacks to calculate the attack penetration probabilities at each stage of the cyber kill chain model. The objective of this research is to predict cyber-attack penetrations by implementing various security controls using modeling and simulation. This research is an extension of developed railway defender kill chain which provides security controls at each stage of CKC for railway organizations to minimize the risk of cyber threats. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079163362

The pervasiveness and democratization of ICTs have allowed people from all backgrounds to access and use them, which has resulted in new information-based assets. At the same time, this phenomenon has brought a new class of problems, in the form of activists, criminals and state actors that target the new assets to achieve their goals, legitimate or not. Cybersecurity includes the research, tools and techniques to protect information assets. However, some cybersecurity measures may clash with the ethical values of citizens.We analyze the synergies and tensions between some of these values, namely security, privacy, fairness and autonomy. From this analysis, we derive a value graph, and then we set out to identify those paths in the graph that lead to satisfying all four aforementioned values in the cybersecurity setting, by taking advantage of their synergies and avoiding their tensions. We illustrate our conceptual discussion with examples of enabling technologies. We also sketch how our methodology can be generalized to any setting where several potentially conflicting values have to be satisfied. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074163260

Speeding up the pattern matching task is an essential step for the success of the aforementioned applications. Wu–Manber algorithm is one of the fastest and most widely used algorithms for multi-pattern matching. Many researchers focused on improving the performance of Wu–Manber algorithm and this work presents a novel attempt parallelize Wu–Manber and make it suitable for multi-core machines. This paper uses Kahn processing network (KPN) model to effectively parallelize data and functional tasks. KPN suggests a parallel programming model that can be utilized in today’s multi-core machines. Hence, we use the KPN model to tailor the execution of Wu–Manber algorithm by breaking down the complexity of data sharing and task processing. The data parallelization is implemented using concurrent executions of multiple KPNs. In addition, task parallelization is achieved within each executing KPN. A single KPN consists of two threads, a producer thread and a consumer thread. The proposed KPN-based parallelization achieves up to 4× speedup over the serial implementation of the algorithm. Finally, the algorithm performance scales well with increasing workloads and the speedup up remains almost constant with increasing number of attack signatures. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068881258
