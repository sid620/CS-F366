Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL.

Machine learning (ML) has been applied in various aspects of AM to improve the whole design and manufacturing workflow especially in the era of industry 4.0. In this review article, various types of ML techniques are first introduced.

As one of the most important components of smart health monitoring and improvement systems, there are numerous challenges in the IoHT, among which cybersecurity is a major challenge that must be addressed with priority. As a well-received security solution to achieve fine-grained access control, ciphertext-policy weighted attribute-based encryption (CP-WABE) has the potential to ensure data security in the IoHT. However, many issues, such as inflexibility, poor computational capability, and insufficient storage efficiency in attributes comparison, remain. To address these issues, we propose a novel access policy expression method using 0-1 coding technology. Based on this method, a flexible and efficient CP-WABE is constructed for the IoHT. Our scheme supports not only weighted attributes but also any form of comparison of weighted attributes. Furthermore, we use offline/online encryption and outsourced decryption technology to ensure that the scheme can run on an inefficient IoT terminal.

Accordingly, we need a quantum tool utilised for designing blockchain frameworks to have the ability to be executed in the level of digital computers and resist the probable attacks from both digital and quantum computers. Quantum walks may be utilised as a quantum-inspired model for designing new cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we present a new authentication and encryption protocol based on quantum-inspired quantum walks (QIQW). The proposed protocol is utilized to build a blockchain framework for secure data transmission among IoT devices. Instead of using classical cryptographic hash functions, quantum hash functions based on QIQW are employed for linking blocks of the chain. The main advantages of the presented framework are helping IoT nodes to effectively share their data with other nodes and full control of their records.

Despite the incessant efforts of cybersecurity research to defend against malware threats, malware developers discover new ways to evade these defense techniques. Traditional static and dynamic analysis methods are ineffective in identifying new malware and pose high overhead in terms of memory and time. Typical machine learning approaches that train a classifier based on handcrafted features are also not sufficiently potent against these evasive techniques and require more efforts due to feature‐engineering. Recent malware detectors indicate performance degradation due to class imbalance in malware datasets. To resolve these challenges, this work adopts a visualization‐based method, where malware binaries are depicted as two‐dimensional images and classified by a deep learning model. We propose an efficient malware detection system based on deep learning. The system uses a reweighted class‐balanced loss function in the final classification layer of the DenseNet model to achieve significant performance improvements in classifying malware by handling imbalanced data issues. Comprehensive experiments performed on four benchmark malware datasets show that the proposed approach can detect new malware samples with higher accuracy (98.23% for the Malimg dataset, 98.46% for the BIG 2015 dataset, 98.21% for the MaleVis dataset, and 89.48% for the unseen Malicia dataset) and reduced false‐positive rates when compared with conventional malware mitigation techniques while maintaining low computational time. The proposed malware detection solution is also reliable and effective against obfuscation attacks. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098800575

Cybersecurity is a primary and challenging issue in healthcare due to the legal and ethical perspective of the patient's medical data. Therefore, the design of CPS model for healthcare applications requires special attention for ensuring data security. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes a secure intrusion, detection with blockchain based data transmission with classification model for CPS in healthcare sector. The presented model performs data acquisition process using sensor devices and intrusion detection takes place using deep belief network (DBN) model. In addition, the presented model uses a multiple share creation (MSC) model for the generation of multiple shares of the captured image, and thereby achieves privacy and security. Besides, the blockchain technology is applied for secure data transmission to the cloud server, which executes the residual network (ResNet) based classification model to identify the presence of the disease. The experimental validation of the presented model takes place using NSL-KDD 2015, CIDDS-001 and ISIC dataset.

CPS constitute the backbone of enterprise (e.g., smart cities), industrial (e.g., smart manufacturing), and critical infrastructure (e.g., energy systems). Thus, their vital importance, interoperability, and plurality of computing devices make them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature within the power grid infrastructure, can lead to disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced by leveraging testbed capabilities in order to replicate and understand power systems operating conditions, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. Adequately modeling and reproducing the behavior of CPS could be a challenging task. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with an emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models that can be used to evaluate the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables the system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101439129

Smart mobility is a crucial element in smart cities, and autonomous vehicles are an essential part of smart mobility. However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed.

In this regard, this paper introduces a novel IoT architecture for the online monitoring of the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) status instead of the traditional observation methods. The proposed IoT architecture is derived from the concept of the cyber-physic system (CPS) in Industry 4.0. However, the cyber-attacks and the classification of the GIS insulation defects represent the main challenges against the implementation of IoT topology for the online monitoring and tracking of the GIS status. For this purpose, advanced machine learning techniques are utilized to detect cyber-attacks to conduct the paradigm and verification. Different test scenarios on various defects in GIS are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IoT architecture.

It incorporates secure networks, secure control systems, secure physical processes, and their interactions seamlessly into a unified framework.

However, cybersecurity attacks are still increasing. An ID system can play a vital role in detecting such threats. Existing ID systems are unable to detect malicious threats, primarily because they adopt approaches that are based on traditional ML techniques, which are less concerned with the accurate classication and feature selection. Thus, developing an accurate and intelligent ID system is a priority. The main objective of this study was to develop a hybrid intelligent intrusion detection system (HIIDS) to learn crucial features representation efciently and automatically from massive unlabeled raw network trafc data. Many ID datasets are publicly available to the cybersecurity research community. As such, we used a spark MLlib (machine learning library)-based robust classier, such as logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) was used for anomaly detection, and a state-of-the-art DL, such as a long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTMAE) for misuse attack was used to develop an efcient and HIIDS to detect and classify unpredictable attacks. Our approach utilized LSTM to detect temporal features and an AE to more efciently detect global features.

Biometric data can be collected through the use of wearable devices, especially smartphones that incorporate a variety of sensors, during the performance of activities by the users. In recent research, numerous identification systems using machine learning classification algorithms have been proposed to provide solutions to this classification problem. However, their ability to perform identification is limited to only suitable selected features of time-series data from the biometric raw data. Therefore, in this study, an architecture for the biometric user identification using walking patterns that employs a convolutional neural network is proposed. Validation of the proposed framework for biometric identification was accomplished through the generation of synthetic data from datasets of samples from public walking. As a result, the framework described in this study provides more effective outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the model and additional metrics than the conventional machine learning utilized for biometric user identification. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098192353

Unlike power grid security, PEV cybersecurity is significantly underexplored. However, cyberattacks on PEVs may lead to disastrous situations such as out-of-service EVs via denial-of-charging (DoC) or battery pack damage via overcharging. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by exploring control-oriented approaches for PEV cybersecurity. Specifically, we focus on designing algorithms for detecting cyberattacks that can potentially affect PEV battery packs during charging. We discuss two algorithms: first, static detector that utilizes only measured variables, and, second, dynamic detector that utilizes the knowledge of system dynamics along with the measurements. Furthermore, we propose a filter-based design approach for the dynamic detector that considers a multiobjective criterion including stability, robustness, and attack sensitivity. We perform theoretical analysis and simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms under DoC and overcharging attacks that indicate the superiority of dynamic detector in terms of attack detectability. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084344645

While the problem of insider threat detection has been studied for a long time in both security and data mining communities, the traditional machine learning based detection approaches, which heavily rely on feature engineering, are hard to accurately capture the behavior difference between insiders and normal users due to various challenges related to the characteristics of underlying data, such as high-dimensionality, complexity, heterogeneity, sparsity, lack of labeled insider threats, and the subtle and adaptive nature of insider threats. Advanced deep learning techniques provide a new paradigm to learn end-to-end models from complex data. In this brief survey, we first introduce commonly-used datasets for insider threat detection and review the recent literature about deep learning for such research. The existing studies show that compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning models can improve the performance of insider threat detection.

In this regard, this paper proposes a new IoT architecture based on utilizing machine learning techniques to suppress cyber-attacks for providing reliable and secure online monitoring for the induction motor status. In particular, advanced machine learning techniques are utilized here to detect cyber-attacks and motor status with high accuracy. The proposed infrastructure validates the motor status via communication channels and the internet connection with economical cost and less effort on connecting various networks. For this purpose, the CONTACT Element platform for IoT is adopted to visualize the processed data based on machine learning techniques through a graphical dashboard. Once the cyber-attacks signal has been detected, the proposed IoT platform based on machine learning will be visualized automatically as fake data on the dashboard of the IoT platform. Different experimental scenarios with data acquisition are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT topology. The results confirm that the proposed IoT architecture based on the machine learning technique can effectively visualize all faults of the motor status as well as the cyber-attacks on the networks. Moreover, all faults of the motor status and the fake data, due to the cyber-attacks, are successfully recognized and visualized on the dashboard of the proposed IoT platform with high accuracy and more clarified visualization, thereby contributing to enhancing the decision-making about the motor status. Furthermore, the introduced IoT architecture with Random Forest algorithm provides an effective detection for the faults on motor due to the vibration under industrial conditions with excellent accuracy of 99.03% that is significantly greater than the other machine learning algorithms. Besides, the proposed IoT has low latency to recognize the motor faults and cyber-attacks to present them in the main dashboard of the IoT platform. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113243035

Unsolicited email or spam is one of the sources of many types of cybercrime techniques that use complicated methods to trick specific victims. Spam detection is one of the leading machine learning-oriented applications in the last decade. In this work, we present a new methodology for detecting spam emails based on deep learning architectures in the context of natural language processing (NLP). Past works on classical machine learning based spam email detection has relied on various feature engineering methods. Identifying a proper feature engineering method is a difficult task and moreover vulnerable in an adversarial environment. Our proposed method leverage the text representation of NLP and map towards spam email detection task. Various email representation methods are utilized to transform emails into email word vectors, as an essential step for machine learning algorithms. Moreover, optimal parameters are identified for many deep learning architectures and email representation by following the hyper-parameter tuning approach. The performance of many classical machine learning classifiers and deep learning architectures with various text representations are evaluated based on publicly available three email corpora. The experimental results show that the deep learning architectures performed better when compared to the standard machine learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This is essentially due to the fact that the deep learning architectures facilitate to learn hierarchical, abstract and sequential feature representations of emails. Furthermore, word embedding with deep learning has performed well in comparison to the other classical email representation methods. The word embedding simplify to learn the syntactic, semantic and contextual similarity of emails. This endows word embedding with deep learning methods in spam email filtering in the real environment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097909399

Using the car-following model the subject vehicle (i.e., the following vehicle) utilizes the leading vehicle's information to detect sensor anomalies by employing previously-trained One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models. This approach allows the AEKF to estimate the state of a vehicle not only based on the vehicle's location and speed, but also by taking into account the state of the surrounding traffic. A communication time delay factor is considered in the car-following model to make it more suitable for real-world applications.

Although such connectivity expands the devices’ ability to fulfill healing and diagnostic functions in a quick and cost-effective manner and can help save many lives, too much reliance on software also results in exposure to several security threats.

However, the open nature of IoT makes it vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Especially, identity spoofing attacks, where an adversary passively listens to the existing radio communications and then mimic the identity of legitimate devices to conduct malicious activities. Existing solutions employ cryptographic signatures to verify the trustworthiness of received information. In prevalent IoT, secret keys for cryptography can potentially be disclosed and disable the verification mechanism. Noncryptographic device verification is needed to ensure trustworthy IoT. In this article, we propose an enhanced deep learning framework for IoT device identification using physical-layer signals. Specifically, we enable our framework to report unseen IoT devices and introduce the zero-bias layer to deep neural networks to increase robustness and interpretability. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real data from automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), an application of IoT in aviation. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to the accurate identification of IoT devices in a variety of IoT applications and services. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100739492

Such supply chain attacks are increasing in frequency and their impacts can be costly to an organisation. Trust between supply chain partners is commonly thought to be a risk management tool, where increasing trust results in reduced risk. However, increased trust may actually expose the supply chain to more risk, not less. In this paper, we propose the concept of the zero trust supply chain. Originating in the field of information technology and cybersecurity, a zero trust philosophy assumes that all actors and activity are untrusted. In contrast to perimeter-based security, which attempts to keep adversarial actors out, a zero trust-based security posture assumes that adversaries are already inside the system, and therefore imposes strict access and authentication requirements. In this paper, we map zero trust concepts to the supply chain, and discuss the steps an organisation might take to transition to zero trust. We set forth a research agenda by examining zero trust through the lens of several organisational theories and propose a number of research propositions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101010009

In this paper, we propose a game theory model to investigate cybersecurity investments with third-party risk propagation in a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one retailer and n suppliers. The optimal investments and their responses to relevant security characteristics, such as intrinsic vulnerability, propagation probability, number of suppliers, and attack probability, are analysed and discussed both theoretically and numerically considering one-stage risk propagation. It is found that there are serious prisoners' dilemma and free-riding phenomena in such a scenario. To mitigate third-party risks and improve the investment efficiency, three coordination mechanisms, joint decision, security risk compensation, and security information sharing, are presented and compared numerically. The results indicate that joint decision-making and security risk compensation perform better on stimulating firms' investments and reducing expected costs both individually and collectively relative to security information sharing. Furthermore, the case of two-stage risk propagation is also supplemented and compared with one-stage case. Based on these findings, some management insights are recommended to cybersecurity managers in supply chains for designing more efficient cybersecurity mechanisms and investment strategies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079220879

Contributing to science and technology studies (STS) work on technoscience and statecraft, I develop the concepts of “territorialization projects” and “digital territory” to capture how the production of state power in the digital age increasingly relies on technoscientific expertise about information infrastructure, shifting tasks of government into the domain of computer scientists and network engineers. The notion of territorialization projects describes states’ ongoing struggle to mobilize science and engineering in order to transform globally distributed information infrastructure into bounded national territory and invest it with patriotic meaning: making digital territory. Digital territory, in other words, is nationalized information infrastructure: it includes building and monopolizing infrastructure as well as normative ideas about nation—who is a digital citizen, and who isn’t; or what constitutes “good” and “bad” digital citizens. Nationalizing information infrastructure and placing statecraft into the hands of scientists and engineers might indicate an emerging form of “techno-nationalism”—a combination of nationalist and technocratic tendencies—raising urgent questions for STS scholarship to investigate the consequences of territorialization projects for justice, democracy, and civic life. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078883206

This rich literature synthesis forms the basis of a novel theoretical framework that provides guidance and insight for blockchain adopters and vendors as well as delineate palpable benefits of this novel technology. An interpretivist philosophical design and inductive reasoning are adopted to conduct the systematic review of literature. A total of 867 papers were retrieved from Scopus database between the years of 2016 and 2020 and subsequently analysed via abductive reasoning, grounded theory and a thematic meta-analysis; where the latter was achieved using a scientometric approach and software tools such as VOS viewer and NVivo. Scientometric analysis revealed the most prolific countries, sources, publications and authors who reside at the vanguard of blockchain developments and adoption. Subsequent grounded theory analysis identified six main clusters of research endeavour viz: “case study”, “challenges and opportunity”, “traceability”, “smart contract” “blockchain and IoT” and “data security”. From 28 SCR metrics identified within literature, five were found to have been positively impacted by blockchain technology solutions, namely: “visibility”, “collaboration”, “integration”, “risk management” and “information sharing.” Prominent applications of blockchain technology in practice were “traceability systems” and “smart contracts” which are often implemented separately or in combination and primarily in food supply chains. This research constitutes the first study to critically synthesise extant literature for evaluation of blockchain solutions’ implication on SCR metrics. New perspectives obtained provided a basis for the novel theoretical framework for implementation that will be valued by software developers and adopting organizations, whilst creating new direction for researchers interested in blockchain technology. © 2021 by the authors.

Recently, diverse Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods were proposed to detect botnet attacks in IoT networks. However, highly imbalanced network traffic data in the training set often degrade the classification performance of state-of-the-art ML and DL models, especially in classes with relatively few samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient DL-based botnet attack detection algorithm that can handle highly imbalanced network traffic data. Specifically, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) generates additional minority samples to achieve class balance, while Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) learns hierarchical feature representations from the balanced network traffic data to perform discriminative classification. We develop DRNN and SMOTE-DRNN models with the Bot-IoT dataset, and the simulation results show that high-class imbalance in the training data adversely affects the precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating charac-teristic curve (AUC), geometric mean (GM) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of the DRNN model. On the other hand, the SMOTE-DRNN model achieved better classification performance with 99.50% precision, 99.75% recall, 99.62% F1 score, 99.87% AUC, 99.74% GM and 99.62% MCC.

Such attacks may have severe consequences in ICS systems, as adversaries could potentially bypass the IDS. This could lead to delayed attack detection which may result in infrastructure damages, financial loss, and even loss of life. This paper explores how adversarial learning can be used to target supervised models by generating adversarial samples using the Jacobian-based Saliency Map attack and exploring classification behaviours. The analysis also includes the exploration of how such samples can support the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. An authentic power system dataset was used to support the experiments presented herein. Overall, the classification performance of two widely used classifiers, Random Forest and J48, decreased by 6 and 11 percentage points when adversarial samples were present.

Various automotive serial protocols are used inside vehicles such as Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN), and FlexRay. CAN Bus is the most used in-vehicle network protocol to support exchange of vehicle parameters between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This protocol lacks security mechanisms by design and is therefore vulnerable to various attacks. Furthermore, connectivity of vehicles has made the CAN Bus vulnerable not only from within the vehicle but also from outside. With the rise of connected cars, more entry points and interfaces have been introduced on board vehicles, thereby also leading to a wider potential attack surface. Existing security mechanisms focus on the use of encryption, authentication, and vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which operate under various constraints such as low bandwidth, small frame size (e.g., in the CAN protocol), limited availability of computational resources, and real-Time sensitivity. We survey and classify current cryptographic and IDS approaches and compare these approaches based on criteria such as real-Time constraints, types of hardware used, changes in CAN Bus behaviour, types of attack mitigation, and software/ hardware used to validate these approaches.

Guidelines on telemedicine would assist healthcare providers in delivering healthcare services based on local circumstances. Objective: To explore and compare guidelines on telehealth and telemedicine in South East Asian countries. Methods: Electronic databases such as Google, PubMed, and Cochrane reviews were searched for articles using keywords such as “telemedicine” OR “telehealth” OR “eHealth” OR “telemedis” AND “guidelines” AND “South East Asia” OR “Malaysia” OR “Singapore” OR “Indonesia” OR “Thailand” OR “Vietnam” published up to 2020. Inclusion criteria were full articles and gray materials (i.e., policy statements, advisories, blueprints, executive summaries, and circulars) related to telemedicine guidelines. No language restrictions were imposed. Only the first 100 Google searches were included for eligibility based on its relevance to telemedicine guidelines. Exclusion criteria were abstracts, duplicate publications, blogs, news articles, promotional brochures, conference proceedings, and telemedicine projects unrelated to telemedicine guidelines. Results: A total of 62,300 articles were identified through the search engines (Google 62,203, PubMed 77, and Cochrane 20) and six articles from additional sources. Sixty-eight full-text articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, but only 24 articles contained some form of guidelines on telemedicine: Indonesia (nine), Malaysia (seven), Singapore (five), Thailand (two), and Vietnam (one). There were six laws, six advisory guidelines, five policy statements, and two circulars (regulations) issued by either the Ministry of Communication and Multimedia, Ministry of Health, or Medical Councils from the respective countries. Issues addressed were clinical governance (100%); information and communication technology infrastructure (83.3%); privacy, storage, and record-keeping (77.8%, respectively); ethics and legal (77.8%); security and safety (72.2%); definitions and applications of telemedicine (72.2%); confidentiality (66.7%); licensing (66.7%); identification (55.6%); cost of information and communication technology infrastructure (55.6%); reimbursement (16.7%); mobile applications (11.1%); and feedback and choices (5.6%).

Multi-cloud, on the other hand, can be trustable paradigm to obviate obstacles such as aforesaid unpleasant features of a single cloud. One of the biggest challenges is to know which cloud is commensurate with user’s business process with regards to security objectives. To this end, the new method is presented to quantify the amount of cloud security risk (CSR) in regards to user’s business process. Therefore, in this paper, the web service composition problem is formulated to bi-objective optimisation problem with service cost and multi-cloud risk viewpoints in ever-increasing multi-cloud environment (MCE) in which each provider has its variable pricing policy and different security level. It is obviously an NP-Hard problem. To solve the combinatorial problem, we develop a bi-objective time-varying particle swarm optimisation (BOTV-PSO) algorithm. The parameters are tuned based on elapsed time so a good balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved.

Innovation such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and blockchain is not only confined to the manufacturing industry but covers the whole of human life. Notwithstanding the said innovation, it also gives rise to cybercrimes with these technologies’ assistance. The botnet called Mirai is one example of compromising the technology in IR 4.0 to launch large-scale cyberattacks through Internet access. It is therefore crucial for the digital forensic (DF) organization to be ready to handle this kind of incident. This paper aims to provide the indicators for DF organizations’ maturity and readiness in the era of IR 4.0. To establish the indicators, a systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted. It involves four phases in the SLR, where the focus is; (1) challenges of DF in IR 4.0, (2) chain of custody and DF readiness, (3) existing maturity model, and (4) benchmarking the maturity element, respectively. It covers the research studies taken from five databases. From the comparison analysis, this study has derived five indicators for the maturity and readiness of DF organization: (1) People and capacity development, (2) Organization, policy and cooperation, (3) Process, (4) Technology and technical, (5) Legislation and regulation. Finally the work outlines the DF practices based on the CMMI ver. 2 practice areas and potential governance and management objectives that can govern the DF organization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101598238

The current security tools are almost perfect when it comes to identifying and preventing known attacks in the smart grid. Still, unfortunately, they do not quite meet the requirements of advanced cyber-security. Adequate protection against cyber threats requires a whole set of processes and tools. Therefore, a more flexible mechanism is needed to examine data sets holistically and detect other-wise unknown threats. This is possible with big modern data analyses based on deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Machine learning, which can rely on adaptive baseline behavior models, effectively detects new, unknown attacks.

Indeed, the vulnerability of the wireless sensor networks to attacks comes principally from their inherent characteristics. As the data are transmitted over the air, it is very easy for an adversary to spy on traffic. Also, to meet the strict budgetary requirements, the sensor nodes tend to not be tamperproof and thus offer no protection against security attacks. Alongside with these vulnerabilities, the human intervention is always not allowed to deal with adversaries who attempt to compromise the network. Therefore, security systems are mainly needed to secure the network and ensure the protection against security threats. Indeed, cryptographic based systems are generally used to ensure security. However, due to the lack of memory and power (low computing, limited energy reserves) of the sensor nodes, most of these approaches are not suitable. Therefore, providing security while respecting the specific constraints of the sensors, represents one of the most important research issue in wireless sensor networks. Indeed, several studies have been conducted these last decades to propose lightweight and efficient security protocols for wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we review the most leading protocols and classify them based the addressed security issue.

The second approach uses a dynamic network entity reputation score to predict malicious actors. The third approach uses time series analysis to forecast attack rates in the network. This paper presents a unique evaluation of the three distinct methods in a common environment of an intrusion detection alert sharing platform, which allows for a comparison of the approaches and illustrates the capabilities of predictive analysis for current and future research and cybersecurity operations.

Cyber-attacks can hit an organization hard by causing several damages such as data breach, financial loss, and reputation loss. Some of the most prominent examples of ransomware attacks in history are WannaCry and Petya, which impacted companies’ finances throughout the globe. Both WannaCry and Petya caused operational processes inoperable by targeting critical infrastructure. It is quite impossible for anti-virus applications using traditional signature-based methods to detect this type of malware because they have different characteristics on each contaminated computer. The most important feature of this type of malware is that they change their contents using their mutation engines to create another hash representation of the executable file as they propagate from one computer to another. To overcome this method that attackers use to camouflage malware, we have created three-channel image files of malicious software. Attackers make different variants of the same software because they modify the contents of the malware. In the solution to this problem, we created variants of the images by applying data augmentationmethods. This article aims to provide an image augmentation enhanced deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for detecting malware families in a metamorphic malware environment. The main contributions of the article consist of three components, including image generation from malware samples, image augmentation, and the last one is classifying the malware families by using a CNN model. In the first component, the collected malware samples are converted into binary file to 3-channel images using the windowing technique. The second component of the system create the augmented version of the images, and the last part builds a classification model. This study uses five different deep CNNmodel formalware family detection. The results obtained by the classifier demonstrate accuracy up to 98%, which is quite satisfactory.

Evidently, identifying and addressing every single vulnerability are an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this article, we provide an attack taxonomy, which takes into consideration the different layers of the IoT stack, i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer's designated characteristics, which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore, using nine real-world cybersecurity incidents that had targeted IoT devices deployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the IoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and potential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies.

Then, beyond the familiar scope, we analyze and discuss the effect mechanisms involving 6 aspects (persuasion, social influence, cognition attitude behavior, trust and deception, language thought decision, emotion and decision-making) and the human vulnerabilities involving 6 aspects (cognition and knowledge, behavior and habit, emotions and feelings, human nature, personality traits, individual characters), respectively. Finally, 16 social engineering attack scenarios (including 13 attack methods) are presented to illustrate how these mechanisms, vulnerabilities and attack methods are used to explain the success of social engineering attacks.

These discussions are heavily documented in the scientific literature and have mainly revolved around extreme traffic situations depicted as moral dilemmas, i.e. situations in which the autonomous vehicle (AV) is required to make a difficult moral choice. Quite surprisingly, little is known about the ethical issues in focus by the AV industry. General claims have been made about the struggles of companies regarding the ethical issues of AVs but these lack proper substantiation. As private companies are highly influential on the development and acceptance of AV technologies, a meaningful debate about the ethics of AVs should take into account the ethical issues prioritised by industry. In order to assess the awareness and engagement of industry on the ethics of AVs, we inspected the narratives in the official business and technical reports of companies with an AV testing permit in California. The findings of our literature and industry review suggest that: (i) given the plethora of ethical issues addressed in the reports, autonomous driving companies seem to be aware of and engaged in the ethics of autonomous driving technology; (ii) scientific literature and industry reports prioritise safety and cybersecurity; (iii) scientific and industry communities agree that AVs will not eliminate the risk of accidents; (iv) scientific literature on AV technology ethics is dominated by discussions about the trolley problem; (v) moral dilemmas resembling trolley cases are not addressed in industry reports but there are nuanced allusions that unravel underlying concerns about these extreme traffic situations; (vi) autonomous driving companies have different approaches with respect to the authority of remote operators; and (vii) companies seem invested in a lowest liability risk design strategy relying on rules and regulations, expedite investigations, and crash/collision avoidance algorithms. © 2021 The Author(s).

At the first stage of intrusion detection, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a detection algorithm to discover suspicious behaviors inside a smart meter. At the second stage, the Temporal Failure Propagation Graph (TFPG) technique is used to generate attack routes for identifying attack events. Finally, the proposed pattern recognition algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between a detected abnormal event and pre-defined cyber attacks. A higher similarity value implies a higher chance that a smart meter is under attack.

Due to its low-cost and high availability (regional/city level scale), this type of network has been widely used in several IoT applications, such as Smart Metering, Smart Grids, Smart Buildings, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), SCADA Systems. By using LPWAN technologies, the IoT devices are less dependent on common and existing infrastructure, can operate using small, inexpensive, and long-lasting batteries (up to 10 years), and can be easily deployed within wide areas, typically above 2 km in urban zones. The starting point of this work was an overview of the security vulnerabilities that exist in LPWANs, followed by a literature review with the main goal of substantiating an attack vector analysis specifically designed for the IoT ecosystem. This methodological approach resulted in three main contributions: (i) a systematic review regarding cybersecurity in LPWANs with a focus on vulnerabilities, threats, and typical defense strategies; (ii) a state-of-the-art review on the most prominent results that have been found in the systematic review, with focus on the last three years; (iii) a security analysis on the recent attack vectors regarding IoT applications using LPWANs. Results have shown that LPWANs communication technologies contain security vulnerabilities that can lead to irreversible harm in critical and non-critical IoT application domains. Also, the conception and implementation of up-to-date defenses are relevant to protect systems, networks, and data. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104073314

This novel cybersecurity attack, that is emerging in both the literature and in the wild, has proved to be very effective given the simplicity of running a crypto-client into a target device. Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features and performance, but all characterized by a host-based architecture. The cited solutions, designed to protect the individual user, are not suitable for efficiently protecting a corporate network, especially against insiders. In this paper, we propose a network-based approach to detect and identify crypto-clients activities by solely relying on the network traffic, even when encrypted and mixed with non-malicious traces. First, we provide a detailed analysis of the real network traces generated by three major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Monero, and Bytecoin, considering both the normal traffic and the one shaped by a VPN. Then, we propose Crypto-Aegis, a Machine Learning (ML) based framework built over the results of our investigation, aimed at detecting cryptocurrencies related activities, e.g., pool mining, solo mining, and active full nodes. Our solution achieves a striking 0.96 of F1-score and 0.99 of AUC for the ROC, while enjoying a few other properties, such as device and infrastructure independence.

To help port policymakers develop cybersecurity measures, this study conceptualized and developed three dimensions of port cybersecurity hygiene (i.e. human, infrastructure, and procedure factors) and investigated the relationships between port cybersecurity hygiene and cyberthreats (i.e. hacktivism, cyber criminality, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and cyber war). A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from all international container port operators and shipping lines with branches in Thailand, and the proposed relationships were tested by structural equation modeling. The results indicated that container ports tended to encounter hacktivism when their human, infrastructure, and procedure factors were vulnerable. The weakness of the human factor could also lead to cyber terrorism, while the deficiency of the infrastructure factor could lead to cyber criminality. Moreover, container ports were likely to be harmed by cyber espionage if their procedure factor was poorly implemented. Hence, the provision of training and education to all port workers, including top executives, managers, and supervisors, are necessary to ensure a cyberthreat-awareness culture at all organizational levels. Improving cybersecurity equipment could prevent unauthorized access to port business data and keep important information secure, while the ISPS Code-based procedures and other preventive measures should be strictly implemented by container ports to reduce the risk of cyberthreats. © 2020 The Author",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086432322

We then carried out an empirical study to assess the effectiveness of three different nudge-related interventions on four types of cybersecurity-specific decisions. Our study demonstrated that the combination of a simple nudge and information provision, termed a “hybrid nudge,” was at least as, and in some decision contexts even more effective in encouraging secure choices as the simple nudge on its own. This indicates that the inclusion of information when deploying a nudge, thereby increasing the intervention's transparency, does not necessarily diminish its effectiveness.

The relatively new emerging paradigms in various sciences, such as geometry (fractals), physics (quantum), and database systems (distributed ledger—blockchain), seem to potentially contribute to a greater shift in the framework of the finance industry, bringing also some concerns (cyber-threats). Consistent and extensive investigation of the reasonable potential impact of these new models (and their underlying technologies) is performed, and then tested through a SWOT analysis, as the main objective of this research. Threats and opportunities are always intrinsically driven by the introduction of technological advancements (revolutions). This research confirms that information availability and the increasing interconnection of crosswise applications of each discovery to the different fields of science is determining the rapid succession of revolutions identified by evident large shifts in economic paradigms. The growing computing capacity and the development of increasingly powerful predictive software are leading to a competitive, extremely dynamic, and challenging system.

There are reasons to be concerned that these data provide a distorted view of cyber threat activity. Commercial cybersecurity firms only focus on a subset of the universe of threats, and they only report publicly on a subset of the subset. High end threats to high-profile victims are prioritized in commercial reporting while threats to civil society organizations, which lack the resources to pay for high-end cyber defense, tend to be neglected or entirely bracketed. This selection bias not only hampers scholarship on cybersecurity but also has concerning consequences for democracy. We present and analyze an original dataset of available public reporting by the private sector together with independent research centers. We also present three case studies tracing reporting patterns on a cyber operation targeting civil society. Our findings confirm the neglect of civil society threats, supporting the hypothesis that commercial interests of firms will produce a systematic bias in reporting, which functions as much as advertising as intelligence. The result is a truncated sample of cyber conflict that underrepresents civil society targeting and distorts academic debate as well as public policy. © 2020 The Author(s).

One internationally recognized document for cybersecurity risk management is the framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides guidelines, best practices and standards for cybersecurity risk management. Nevertheless, as other self-assessment frameworks, it produces a static view of an organization's cyber posture and does not capture the dynamics of organizational changes and cyberattacks. Moreover, the current situation sees small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in a critical position since they need to manage their cybersecurity while usually not being skilled or equipped enough to internalize this process. Therefore, there is a need for a practical and easily applicable model able to identify a cybersecurity risk profile and its dynamics. This study proposes a system dynamics methodology and tool (SMECRA - SME Cyber Risk Assessment) for supporting cybersecurity investment decisions for SMEs through the evaluation of cyber risk and previous investments. SMECRA addresses dynamic organizational complexity and can be used to assess cyber risks and related dynamics over time. Three case studies demonstrate its capability to assess a SME's cybersecurity status and to evaluate investments impacts on an organization's risk profile, raising cybersecurity awareness.

The recent rise in the number of phishing attacks has instilled distrust in legitimate internet users, making them feel less safe even in the presence of powerful antivirus apps. Reports of a rise in financial damages as a result of phishing website attacks have caused grave concern. Several methods, including blacklists and machine learning-based models, have been proposed to combat phishing website attacks. The blacklist anti-phishing method has been faulted for failure to detect new phishing URLs due to its reliance on compiled blacklisted phishing URLs. Many ML methods for detecting phishing websites have been reported with relatively low detection accuracy and high false alarm. Hence, this research proposed a Functional Tree (FT) based meta-learning models for detecting phishing websites. That is, this study investigated improving the phishing website detection using empirical analysis of FT and its variants. The proposed models outperformed baseline classifiers, meta-learners and hybrid models that are used for phishing websites detection in existing studies. Besides, the proposed FT based meta-learners are effective for detecting legitimate and phishing websites with accuracy as high as 98.51% and a false positive rate as low as 0.015. Hence, the deployment and adoption of FT and its meta-learner variants for phishing website detection and applicable cybersecurity attacks are recommended. © 2021 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110078302

Developing models for these cyberattacks and analyzing them will elucidate hidden layers and tactics used to design the attacks, helping water systems’ authorities to improve and upgrade state-estimation processes and detection algorithms accordingly. In this paper, a bi-level nonlinear optimization cyberattack model is proposed that will result in sequential tank's overflow or fully withdrawn in less than three hours. The attack model is developed based upon injecting false data into the hourly measurements of the pump(s) feeding the tank, as well as the total demand of the network.

The legal framework, together with technical standards, is a necessary parameter for the production and deployment of robots. However, European law does not regulate robots as such, and there exist multiple and overlapping legal requirements focusing on specific contexts, such as product safety and medical devices. Besides, the recently enacted European Cybersecurity Act establishes a cybersecurity certification framework, which could be used to define cybersecurity requirements for robots, although concrete cyber-physical implementation requirements are not yet prescribed. In this article, we illustrate cybersecurity challenges and their subsequent safety implications with the concrete example of care robots. These robots interact in close, direct contact with children, elderly, and persons with disabilities, and a malfunctioning or cybersecurity threat may affect the health and well-being of these people. Moreover, care robots may process vast amounts of data, including health and behavioral data, which are especially sensitive in the healthcare domain. Security vulnerabilities in robots thus raise significant concerns, not only for manufacturers and programmers, but also for those who interact with them, especially in sensitive applications such as healthcare. While the latest European policymaking efforts on robot regulation acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity, many details, and their impact on user safety have not yet been addressed in depth. Our contribution aims to answer the question whether the current European legal framework is prepared to address cyber and physical risks from care robots and ensure safe human–robot interactions in such a sensitive context. Cybersecurity and physical product safety legal requirements are governed separately in a dual regulatory framework, presenting a challenge in governing uniformly and adequately cyber-physical systems such as care robots. We conceptualize and discuss the challenges of regulating cyber-physical systems’ security with the current dual framework, particularly the lack of mandatory certifications. We conclude that policymakers need to consider cybersecurity as an indissociable aspect of safety to ensure robots are truly safe to use. © 2021 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102615126

However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience.

Analysis of the modern security threats at the IoT/IIoT, VANET, and WSN inter-device infrastructures demonstrates that the main concern is a set of network security threats targeted at the functional sustainability of smart urban infrastructure, the most common use case of smart networks. As a result of our study, systematization of the existing cybersecurity risk assessment methods has been provided. Expert-based risk assessment and active human participation cannot be provided for the huge, complex, and permanently changing digital environment of the smart city. The methods of scenario analysis and functional analysis are specific to industrial risk management and are hardly adaptable to solving cybersecurity tasks. The statistical risk evaluation methods force us to collect statistical data for the calculation of the security indicators for the self-organizing networks, and the accuracy of this method depends on the number of calculating iterations. In our work, we have proposed a new approach for cybersecurity risk management based on object typing, data mining, and quantitative risk assessment for the smart city infrastructure. The experimental study has shown us that the artificial neural network allows us to automatically, unambiguously, and reasonably assess the cyber risk for various object types in the dynamic digital infrastructures of the smart city. © 2021 by the authors.

To be trustworthy, systems need to remain safe while being resilient to unpredictable changes, functional/operational failures and cybersecurity threats. Rigorous validation and verification are essential to ensure trustworthiness of AS. Current engineering practice relies heavily on Verification and Validation (V&V) test-and-fix of system characteristics which is very time-consuming and expensive, limiting the possibilities for exploration of alternatives in system design. Instead, we focus on building a correct-by-construction system. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying and analysing mission requirements for squads of autonomous missions. Clear definition of requirements is an important pre-requisite for mission planning and for V&V of mission management. We use a structured approach to requirements identification and use formal modelling to help remove ambiguities in the requirements and to specify formal properties that should be satisfied by the missions. Our approach use a combination of analysis techniques based on Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and formal modelling to generate critical requirements that ensure the safety and security of the system. We also suggest a compositional approach for formal modelling to enhance re-usability and address the complexity of formal modelling. Our approach is being evaluated through consideration of a combined mission of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with deployment/recovery of small Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) within a shipping channel whereby the USV has to safely maintain station for a long period and then proceed to recover the UUV, while maintaining a communication link to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099185815

Generic Object-Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE), which is a widely used communication protocol defined in IEC 61850, provides reliable and fast transmission of events for the electrical substation system. This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of this protocol and analyzes the potential impact on the smart grid by rigorously analyzing the security of the GOOSE protocol using an automated process and identifying vulnerabilities in the context of smart grid communication. The vulnerabilities are tested using a real-time simulation and industry standard hardware-in-the-loop emulation. An in-depth experimental analysis is performed to demonstrate and verify the security weakness of the GOOSE publish-subscribe protocol towards the substation protection within the smart grid setup. It is observed that an adversary who might have familiarity with the substation network architecture can create falsified attack scenarios that can affect the physical operation of the power system. Extensive experiments using the real-time testbed validate the theoretical analysis, and the obtained experimental results prove that the GOOSE-based IEC 61850 compliant substation system is vulnerable to attacks from malicious intruders. © 2020 by the authors.

The classical approach to tackling this problem is the periodic (observation) method, which is inefficient because it often observes states at a very high frequency. This inefficiency has motivated the idea of event-based method, which leverages the evolution dynamics in question and makes observations only when some rules are triggered (i.e., only when certain conditions hold). This paper initiates the investigation of using the event-based method to estimate the equilibrium in the new application domain of cybersecurity, where equilibrium is an important metric that has no closed-form solutions. More specifically, the paper presents an event-based method for estimating cybersecurity equilibrium in the preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics, which has been proven globally convergent. The presented study proves that the estimated equilibrium from our trigger rule i) indeed converges to the equilibrium of the dynamics and ii) is Zeno-free, which assures the usefulness of the event-based method. Numerical examples show that the event-based method can reduce 98% of the observation cost incurred by the periodic method. In order to use the event-based method in practice, this paper investigates how to bridge the gap between i) the continuous state in the dynamics model, which is dubbed probability-state because it measures the probability that a node is in the secure or compromised state, and ii) the discrete state that is often encountered in practice, dubbed sample-state because it is sampled from some nodes. This bridge may be of independent value because probability-state models have been widely used to approximate exponentially-many discrete state systems. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097155177

Furthermore, outbreaks of new malware often cannot provide a large quantity of training samples for machine-learning-based approaches to counter malware campaigns. The malware defense system should aim to achieve the best balance between early detection and detection accuracy. In this paper, we present a situation-aware access control framework to work with existing file systems as a stackable add-on. Our framework enables the access control decision making to be deferred when required, to observe the consequence of such an access request to the file system and to roll back changes if required. As an application against ransomware attacks, it can be applied to preserve file content integrity, by enforcing that all binary files written to the file system have consistent internal file structures with the declared file types, and rolling back changes that violate such constraints. We envision our access control framework to complement existing operating system access control frameworks, to significantly reduce the dimension of data required for machine learning, and to build extra resilience into the operating systems against damages caused by either malware or software defects. We demonstrate the practicality of our framework through a prototype testing, capturing relevant ransomware situations. The experimental results along with a large ransomware dataset show that our framework can be effectively applied in practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092371894

These systems are vulnerable to several cybersecurity attacks, which are increasing in number and sophistication. Due to this reason, new intrusion detection techniques have to be developed, being as accurate as possible for these scenarios. Intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms have already shown a high performance in terms of accuracy. This research proposes the study and evaluation of several preprocessing techniques based on traffic categorization for a machine learning neural network algorithm. This research uses for its evaluation two benchmark datasets, namely UGR16 and the UNSW-NB15, and one of the most used datasets, KDD99. The preprocessing techniques were evaluated in accordance with scalar and normalization functions. All of these preprocessing models were applied through different sets of characteristics based on a categorization composed by four groups of features: basic connection features, content characteristics, statistical characteristics and finally, a group which is composed by traffic-based features and connection direction-based traffic characteristics. The objective of this research is to evaluate this categorization by using various data preprocessing techniques to obtain the most accurate model. Our proposal shows that, by applying the categorization of network traffic and several preprocessing techniques, the accuracy can be enhanced by up to 45%. The preprocessing of a specific group of characteristics allows for greater accuracy, allowing the machine learning algorithm to correctly classify these parameters related to possible attacks. © 2021 by the authors.

The threats present in cyberspace are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, and their prevention requires not only knowledge and special equipment, but also considerable financial resources. As such, the State has to put a great deal of effort (both institutional and financial) into cybersecurity measures directed against attacks. In order to meet the challenges connected with ensuring cybersecurity, the legislators have undertaken the regulation of such issues by adopting laws on the national cybersecurity system to allow the responsible authorities to properly secure cyberspace against threats. As part of the national cybersecurity system, lawmakers have imposed a number of obligations on public entities to ensure that information systems are resistant to actions which compromise the confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, and authenticity of processed data, and the related services offered by such systems. Appropriate obligations have also been exacted on the operators of essential services (OES), i.e. services key to maintaining critical social or economic activities which are included in the list of essential services. © 2021, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Sklodowskiej w Lublinie.

Several models and techniques to automatically detect spam emails have been introduced and developed yet non showed 100% predicative accuracy. Among all proposed models both machine and deep learning algorithms achieved more success. Natural language processing (NLP) enhanced the models' accuracy. In this work, the effectiveness of word embedding in classifying spam emails is introduced. Pre-trained transformer model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is fine-tuned to execute the task of detecting spam emails from non-spam (HAM). BERT uses attention layers to take the context of the text into its perspective. Results are compared to a baseline DNN (deep neural network) model that contains a BiLSTM (bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) layer and two stacked Dense layers. In addition results are compared to a set of classic classifiers k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) and NB (Naive Bayes). Two open-source data sets are used, one to train the model and the other to test the persistence and robustness of the model against unseen data.

Social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats are one of the major methods for creating turmoil, especially by targeting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and healthcare services. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks are based on the use of psychological and systematic techniques to manipulate the target. The objective of this research study is to explore the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice social engineering-based techniques, attack methods, and platforms used for conducting such cybersecurity attacks and threats. We undertake a systematically directed Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) related to the recent upsurge in social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 52 primary studies were selected from both formal and grey literature based on the established quality assessment criteria. As an outcome of this research study; we discovered that the major social engineering-based techniques used during the COVID-19 pandemic are phishing, scamming, spamming, smishing, and vishing, in combination with the most used socio-technical method: fake emails, websites, and mobile apps used as weapon platforms for conducting successful cyber-attacks. Three types of malicious software were frequently used for system and resource exploitation are; ransomware, trojans, and bots. We also emphasized the economic impact of cyber-attacks performed on different organizations and critical infrastructure in which hospitals and healthcare were on the top targeted infrastructures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we identified the open challenges, general recommendations, and prospective solutions for future work from the researcher and practitioner communities by using the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099095693

We aimed to understand whether and how digital health technologies (DHTs) are absorbed in Africa, tracking Ethiopia as a key node. We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from inception to 02 February 2021 for studies of any design that investigated the potential of DHTs in clinical or public health practices in Ethiopia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021240645) and it was designed to inform our ongoing DHT-enabled randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04216420). We found 27,493 potentially relevant citations, among which 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 596,128 patients, healthy individuals, and healthcare professionals. The studies involved six DHTs: mHealth (29 studies, 574,649 participants); electronic health records (13 studies, 4534 participants); telemedicine (4 studies, 465 participants); cloud-based application (2 studies, 2382 participants); information communication technology (3 studies, 681 participants), and artificial intelligence (1 study, 13,417 participants). The studies targeted six health conditions: maternal and child health (15), infectious diseases (14), non-communicable diseases (3), dermatitis (1), surgery (4), and general health conditions (15). The outcomes of interest were feasibility, usability, willingness or readiness, effectiveness, quality improvement, and knowledge or attitude toward DHTs. Five studies involved RCTs. The analysis showed that although DHTs are a relatively recent phenomenon in Ethiopia, their potential harnessing clinical and public health practices are highly visible. Their adoption and implementation in full capacity require more training, access to better devices such as smartphones, and infrastructure. DHTs hold much promise tackling major clinical and public health backlogs and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem in Ethiopia. More RCTs are needed on emerging DHTs including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, cybersecurity, telemedicine, and wearable devices to provide robust evidence of their potential use in such settings and to materialize the WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health. © 2021, The Author(s).",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113141711

Furthermore, it is investigated whether the stakeholders involved in this ecosystem can create sufficient value to sustain in the market. The outcome of this research includes an economic model for evaluating the value creation and distribution among the stakeholders. This model is a critical step forward to better align the values (i.e., utilities and profits) of stakeholders.

Cybersecurity experts use the term “social engineering” to highlight the “human factor” in digitized systems, as social engineering attacks aim at manipulating people to reveal sensitive information. In this paper, we explore how discursive framings of individual versus collective security by cybersecurity experts redefine roles and responsibilities at the digitalized workplace. We will first show how the rhetorical figure of the deficient user is constructed vis-à-vis notions of (in)security in social engineering discourses. Second, we will investigate the normative tensions that these practices create. To do so, we link work in science and technology studies on the politics of deficit construction to recent work in critical security studies on securitization and resilience. Empirically, our analysis builds on a multi-sited conference ethnography during three cybersecurity conferences as well as an extensive document analysis. Our findings suggest a redistribution of institutional responsibility to the individual user through three distinct social engineering story lines—“the oblivious employee,” “speaking code and social,” and “fixing human flaws.” Finally, we propose to open up the discourse on social engineering and its inscribed politics of deficit construction and securitization and advocate for companies and policy makers to establish and foster a culture of collective cyber in/security and corporate responsibility. © The Author(s) 2021.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100958757

As a primary defense mechanism, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is expected to adapt and secure the computing infrastructures from the ever-changing sophisticated threat landscape. Many deep learning approaches have recently been proposed; however, these techniques face significant challenges in identifying all types of attacks, especially rare attacks due to network traffic imbalances and the lack of a sufficient number of abnormal traffic samples for model training. To overcome these shortcomings and improve detection performance, this paper presents an unsupervised deep learning approach for intrusion detection. Unlike the existing IDS model that extracts features and trains a classifier in two separate stages, a single-stage IDS approach that integrates a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (1D CAE) and a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) as a classifier into a joint optimization framework is introduced in this paper for the first time. Using only the normal traffic samples, the approach simultaneously optimizes the 1D CAE for compact feature representation and the OCSVM for classification by defining a unified objective function combining reconstruction error with classification error. Thus, the generated compact feature representation has not only reconstruction ability but also discriminative ability for classification. An in-depth ablation analysis validates the design decisions and provides further insight of the proposed approach. An extensive set of experiments on two benchmark intrusion datasets, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, demonstrates the generalization ability of the proposed model for unseen attacks and confirms it as a competitive approach over the recent state-of-the-art intrusion detection baselines. Overall, the obtained results emphasize that the proposed approach has potential to serve as a baseline for building an effective IDS. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101500628

New technologies have increased the type and scope of assets vulnerable to cyberthreats, and with them the number of governing units who can claim jurisdiction over cybersecurity-related issues. Uncertainty about the nature of the problem has led the U.S. Congress to rely heavily on bureaucratic witnesses and focus on how existing regulations can be brought to bear.

Presently, there are two major challenges known with the existing anti-phishing solutions. Low detection rate and lack of quick access time in a real-time environment. However, it has been established that blacklist solution methods offer quick and immediate access time but with a low detection rate. This research paper presents an automated white-list approach for detecting phishing attacks. The white-list is determined by carrying out a detailed analysis between the visual link and the actual link. The similarities of the known trusted site are calculated by juxtaposing the domain name with the contents of the whitelist and later match it with the IP address before a decision is made and further analyzing the actual link and the visual link by calculating the similarities of the known trusted site. The technique then takes a final decision on the extracted information from the hyperlink, which can also be obtained from the web address provided by the user. The experiments carried out provided a very high level of accuracy, specifically, when the dataset was relatively at the lowest level. Six different datasets were used to perform the experiments. The average accuracy obtained after the six experiments was 96.17% and the approach detects phishing sites with a 95.0% true positive rate. It was observed that the level of accuracy varies from one dataset to another. This result shows that the proposed method performs better than similar approaches benchmarked with. The efficiency of the approach was further established through its computation time, memory, bandwidth as well as other computational resources that were utilized with the minimum requirements when compared with other approaches. This solution has provided immense benefits over the existing solutions by reducing the memory requirements and computational complexity, among other benefits. It has also shown that the proposed method can provide more robust detection performances when compared to other techniques. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107530292

This paper presents a novel testbed architecture of IoT network which can be used to evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based security applications. The platform NSX vCloud NFV was employed to facilitate the execution of Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Orchestration (SO) to offer dynamic testbed networks, which allow the interaction of edge, fog and cloud tiers. While deploying the architecture, real-world normal and attack scenarios are executed to collect labeled datasets. The generated datasets are named ‘TON_IoT’, as they comprise heterogeneous data sources collected from telemetry datasets of IoT services, Windows and Linux-based datasets, and datasets of network traffic. The TON_IoT network dataset is validated using four machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms of Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Deep Neural Networks, revealing a high performance of detection accuracy using the set of training and testing.

Sometimes, there are uncertainties in recognizing a cyberattack and nullifying its effects using righteous cybersecurity. For that reason, this article introduces interval-valued complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations (IVCIFRs). For the first time in the theory of fuzzy sets, we investigated the relationships among different types of cybersecurity and the sources of cyberattacks. Moreover, the Hasse diagram for the interval-valued complex intuitionistic partial order set and relation is defined. The concepts of the Hasse diagram are used to inspect different cybersecurity techniques and practices. Then, using the properties of Hasse diagrams, the most beneficial technique is identified.

To name but a few, the primary goals of OPF are to meet system demand at minimum production cost, minimum emission, and minimum voltage deviation. Being at the heart of power system problems for half a century, the OPF can be split into two significant categories, namely optimal active power flow (OAPF) and optimal reactive power flow (ORPF). The OPF is spontaneously a complicated non-linear and non-convex problem; however, it becomes more complex by considering different constraints and restrictions having to do with real power grids. Furthermore, power system operators in the modern-day power networks implement new limitations to the problem. Consequently, the OPF problem becomes more and more complex which can exacerbate the situation from mathematical and computational standpoints. Thus, it is crucially important to decipher the most appropriate methods to solve different types of OPF problems. Although a copious number of mathematical-based methods have been employed to handle the problem over the years, there exist some counterpoints, which prevent them from being a universal solver for different versions of the OPF problem. To address such issues, innovative alternatives, namely heuristic algorithms, have been introduced by many researchers. Inasmuch as these state-of-the-art algorithms show a significant degree of convenience in dealing with a variety of optimization problems irrespective of their complexities, they have been under the spotlight for more than a decade. This paper provides an extensive review of the latest applications of heuristic-based optimization algorithms so as to solve different versions of the OPF problem. In addition, a comprehensive review of the available methods from various dimensions is presented.

In the interests of storing these attributes of user behavior, as well as storing such attributes from large-scale WSN, a hybrid NoSQL database is created based on graph and document-oriented approaches. The algorithms for determining each of the features using the NoSQL database are specified. The general scheme of stego-insider detection is also provided. To confirm the efficiency of the approach, an experiment was carried out on a real network. During the experiment, a database of user behavior was collected. Then, user behavior features were retrieved from the database using special SQL queries. The analysis of the results of SQL queries is carried out, and their applicability for determining the attribute is justified. Weak points of the approach and ways to improve them are indicated. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107972618

In this regard, this paper proposes a secured stochastic energy management scheme for both grid-connected and islanded hybrid AC-DC MGs (HMGs) considering renewable energy sources (RESs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and energy storage devices (ESs). In this work, the operation of HMGs is formulated as a single objective optimization problem, which is solved using the interior search optimization algorithm (ISOA). In order to reinforce data security in HMGs, a deep learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and prediction interval is proposed to detect false data injection attacks (FDIA) on advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs). In this work, the 2 m point estimation method is utilized to model uncertainties associated with the forecasted output power of RESs, energy market price, charging demand of PHEVs, and load demand. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using IEEE 33 bus test system for both operation modes. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103320250

Thus, aspects of national cybersecurity can often critically depend on the personal attitudes and behavior of average citizens connecting online. However, to date, theories of state cybersecurity have almost exclusively focused on the macro-level, and very little is known about how the mass public reacts to-and protects themselves from-cybersecurity threats. This study addresses this gap, drawing on psychological theories of risk perception to explain why the public simultaneously reports great concern about cybersecurity, yet does little to protect their personal safety online. Using a novel survey experiment, we examine how exposure to different types of data breaches impacts citizens' cyber risk assessments, personal online behavior, and support for various national cybersecurity policies. We find that baseline concerns about cybersecurity and knowledge about safe online practices are very low. However, exposure to a personally relevant data breach heightens risk perception and increases willingness to engage in safer online practices. But these effects are circumscribed-actual online behavior is more resistant to change. These results have important implications for the design of effective state cybersecurity policy. © 2020 The Author(s) (2020).

Aiming to minimize the social costs incurred due to cyberattacks, we consider not only the monetary investment costs but also the deprivation costs due to detection and containment delays. We also consider the effect of positive externalities of the overall cybersecurity investment on an individual firm's resource allocation attitude. The optimal decision guides the firms on the countermeasure portfolio mix (detection vs. prevention vs. containment) and government intelligence investments while accounting for actions of a strategic attacker and firm budgetary limitations. We accomplish this via a two-stage stochastic programming model. In the first stage, firms decide on prevention and detection investments aided by government intelligence investments that improve detection effectiveness. In the second stage, once the attacker's actions are realized, firms decide on containment investments after evaluating the cyberattacks. We demonstrate the applicability of our model via a case study. We find that externality can reduce the government's intelligence investment and that the firm's detection investment receives priority over containment. We also note that while prevention effectiveness has a decreasing impact on intelligence, it is beneficial to spend more on intelligence given its increasing returns to the reduction of social costs related to cybersecurity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092645227

Currently most published security solutions available for healthcare data are not focused on data flow all the way from IoT sensor devices placed on a patient's body through network routers to doctor's offices. In this paper, we studied how the IoT network facilitates healthcare data transmission for remote medical treatment, explored security risks associated with unsecured data transmission, especially between IoT sensor devices and network routers, and then proposed an encrypted security solution initiated at IoT sensor devices. Our proposed solution provides a cryptography algorithm embedded into the sensor device such that the packets generated with patient's health data are encrypted right at the sensor device before being transmitted. The proof of concept has been verified using a lab setup with two level encryption at the IoT sensor level and two level decryption at the receiving end at the doctor's office.

However, tightly coupled feature-engineering based on previous domain knowledge risks not being effective when faced with a new threat.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on 29 semi-structured interviews with members of management committees and internal auditors based in Belgium. Findings: The analysis reveals that a digitalised business environment affects the internal audit function in three respects. First, it impacts its scope. The agility of the internal audit planning and the required digital knowledge are expected to increase and information technology (IT) risks gain importance, especially cybersecurity threats. Second, the demand for consulting activities performed by internal auditors is higher and third, digitalisation modifies the working practices of internal auditors in their day-to-day tasks. New technologies such as data analytics tools are being implemented progressively in internal audit departments and digital skills are considered a critical asset. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted in the European Union and gathers opinions of members of management committees and internal auditors. Future research could focus on other internal auditing stakeholders in other legal contexts. Practical implications: The internal audit function needs to integrate IT and data analytics skills. In addition, the internal audit function should develop consulting activities to help organisations deal with the digitalisation of the business environment.

The pandemic has resulted in a number of recent cyberattacks on hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization and its partners, and others. Objective: The aim of this review was to identify key cybersecurity challenges, solutions adapted by the health sector, and areas of improvement needed to counteract the recent increases in cyberattacks (eg, phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks), which have been used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in technology and people introduced through changes to working practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A scoping review was conducted by searching two major scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) using the search formula “(covid OR healthcare) AND cybersecurity.” Reports, news articles, and industry white papers were also included if they were related directly to previously published works, or if they were the only available sources at the time of writing. Only articles in English published in the last decade were included (ie, 2011-2020) in order to focus on current issues, challenges, and solutions. Results: We identified 9 main challenges in cybersecurity, 11 key solutions that health care organizations adapted to address these challenges, and 4 key areas that need to be strengthened in terms of cybersecurity capacity in the health sector. We also found that the most prominent and significant methods of cyberattacks that occurred during the pandemic were related to phishing, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and malware. Conclusions: This scoping review identified the most impactful methods of cyberattacks that targeted the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges in cybersecurity, solutions, and areas in need of improvement. We provided useful insights to the health sector on cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics that may materialize in the future. © Ying He, Aliyu Aliyu, Mark Evans, Cunjin Luo.

For example, weight in kilograms or pounds and fuel-efficiency in km/l or l/100 km. One unit can be a linear or non-linear scaling of another. The variation in metrics due to the non-linear scaling makes Anomaly Detection (AD) challenging. Most existing AD algorithms rely on distance- or density-based functions, which makes them sensitive to how data is expressed. This means that they are representation dependent. To avoid such a problem, we introduce a new anomaly detection method, which we call ‘usfAD: Unsupervised Stochastic Forest-based Anomaly Detector’. Our empirical evaluation in synthetic and real-world cybersecurity (spam detection, malicious URL detection and intrusion detection) datasets shows that our approach is more robust to the variation in units/scales used to express data. It produces more consistent and better results than five state-of-the-art AD methods namely: local outlier factor; one-class support vector machine; isolation forest; nearest neighbor in a random subsample of data; and, simple histogram-based probabilistic method. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094883852

Fifth generation (5G) networks are important components of smart cities, where intelligent access control is deployed for identity authentication, online banking, and cyber security. To assure secure transactions and to protect user's identities against cybersecurity threats, strong authentication techniques should be used. The prevalence of biometrics, such as fingerprints, in authentication and identification makes the need to safeguard them important across different areas of smart applications. Our study presents a system to detect alterations to biometric modalities to discriminate pristine, adulterated, and fake biometrics in 5G-based smart cities. Specifically, we use deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a hybrid model that combines CNN with convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) to compute a three-tier probability that a biometric has been tempered.

RBM training can be performed using contrastive divergence (CD) and quantum annealing (QA). QA-based RBM training is fundamentally different from CD and requires samples from a quantum computer. We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a RBM using QA for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24&#x0025; to 95.68&#x0025;, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases from 74.14&#x0025; to 80.04&#x0025;. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93&#x0025;. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset.

Recently, the author has explored adversarial learning for invertible steganography (ALIS) and demonstrated the potential of deep neural networks to reinvigorate an obsolete invertible steganographic method. With the worldwide popularisation of the Internet of things and cloud computing, invertible steganography can be recognised as a favourable way of facilitating data management and authentication due to the ability to embed information without causing permanent distortion. In light of growing concerns over cybersecurity, it is important to take a step forwards to investigate invertible steganography for encrypted data. Indeed, the multidisciplinary research in invertible steganography and cryptospace computing has received considerable attention. In this paper, we extend previous work and address the problem of cryptospace invertible steganography with deep neural networks. Specifically, we revisit a seminal work on cryptospace invertible steganography in which the problem of message decoding and image recovery is viewed as a type of binary classification. We formulate a general expression encompassing spatial, spectral, and structural analyses towards this particular classification problem and propose a novel discrimination function based on a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN) which predicts bit-planes with stacked neural networks in a top-down manner. Experimental results evaluate the performance of various discrimination functions and validate the superiority of neural-network-aided discrimination function in terms of classification accuracy.

To overcome this problem, a four-phase system is developed for intrusion detection based on encoding techniques and deep learning. In the first phase, input data are collected from NSL-KDD, Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity-Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CIC-IDS2017), and Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID). The collected data are converted into the machine-readable form by using label and one hot encoding technique that reduces the human intervention process and increases the accuracy of data classification. Next, the top percentile and recursive features are selected utilizing second percentile methodology and recursive feature elimination. The undertaken feature selection techniques; second percentile method and recursive feature elimination selects the relevant or active features from the pre-processed data that effectively diminishes the computational time and complexity of the proposed model. In the final phase, sparse autoencoder with swish-PReLU activation model is proposed to classify the normal and traffic types in the NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2017, and AWID datasets.

Different approaches have been designed in order to detect anomalies: statistics-based, isolation-based, clustering-based, etc. In this paper, we present a structured survey of the existing anomaly detection methods for data streams with a deep view on Isolation Forest (iForest). We first provide an implementation of Isolation Forest Anomalies detection in Stream Data (IForestASD), a variant of iForest for data streams. This implementation is built on top of scikit-multiflow (River), which is an open source machine learning framework for data streams containing a single anomaly detection algorithm in data streams, called Streaming half-space trees. We performed experiments on different real and well known data sets in order to compare the performance of our implementation of IForestASD and half-space trees. Moreover, we extended the IForestASD algorithm to handle drifting data by proposing three algorithms that involve two main well known drift detection methods: ADWIN and KSWIN. ADWIN is an adaptive sliding window algorithm for detecting change in a data stream. KSWIN is a more recent method and it refers to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Windowing method for concept drift detection. More precisely, we extended KSWIN to be able to deal with n-dimensional data streams. We validated and compared all of the proposed methods on both real and synthetic data sets. In particular, we evaluated the F1-score, the execution time, and the memory consumption. The experiments show that our extensions have lower resource consumption than the original version of IForestASD with a similar or better detection efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose a supervised machine learning method for cyber-threat detection, which modifies the training set to reduce data over-fitting when training a deep neural network. This is done by re-positioning the decision boundary that separates the normal training samples and the threats. Particularly, it re-assigns the normal training samples that are close to the boundary to the opposite class and trains a competitive deep neural network from the modified training set. In this way, it learns a classification model that can detect unseen threats, which behave similarly to normal samples.

The risk of system intrusion is augmented by the intrinsic openness of commonly utilized technologies like TCP/IP protocols. As TCP relies on IP addresses, an attacker may easily trace the IP address of the organization. Given that many organizations run the risk of data breach and cyber-attacks at a certain point, a repeatable and well-developed incident response framework is critical to shield them. Enterprise cloud possesses the challenges of security, lack of transparency, trust and loss of controls. Technology eases quickens the processing of information but holds numerous risks including hacking and confidentiality problems. The risk increases when the organization outsources the cloud storage services through the vendor and suffers from security breaches and need to create security systems to prevent data networks from being compromised.

However, these systems are typically vulnerable to cyberattacks. Among the different types of cyberattacks, the covert attack is one of the hardest to detect–it is undetectable when the system is operating under normal conditions. In this article, we develop a data-driven detection framework that utilizes the degradation process of the system to detect covert attacks. We derive mathematical characteristics of the degradation processes under covert attacks that are used for developing a sequential likelihood ratio test method for attack detection. We verify our methodology through an extensive numerical study and a case study on a rotating machinery setup. Our results show that the methodology helps detect covert attacks within reasonable delay time and is applicable under real-world settings. © Copyright © 2020 “IISE”.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091189075

This discipline adds to cybersecurity the mindset of preparing for the unexpected and prioritizing business continuity over simply protecting systems and assets. However, cyber resilience operationalization requires knowledge and investing into its multiple domains and policies. Moreover, the only aids companies have for the operationalization of cyber resilience are frameworks that list the domains and policies, but do not guide them on an effective order in which to implement them. These aids will often require companies to select the set of policies that suits them and decide the order of implementation on their own. This selection process will require resources for acquiring the required knowledge on top of the resources for the implementation of the policies. Since most companies have limited resources and to minimize the investment required for cyber resilience operationalization, this study proposes an implementation order for cyber resilience policies based on the current literature and the iterative evaluation by six experts. This implementation order could potentially help companies operationalize cyber resilience effectively and diminish the investment needed to do so. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091164581

Actions that reclaim control of a resource pose costs, but control of a resource by an adversary also poses costs. Thus, strategy is required to maximize outcomes. Research on the Dark Triad of personality has suggested that Machiavellianism is associated with a strategic orientation, whereas psychopathy and narcissism are associated with direct aggression and overconfidence (respectively). Thus, individuals high in Machiavellianism should outperform those high in psychopathy and narcissism in a strategic resource control game. We tested this hypothesis using a modified version of the “Flipit” game. Using this type of behavioral extension of an Extensive Form Game (EFG) we found that Machiavellian individuals were more successful in their performance than were those high in narcissism and psychopathy. Further, poor performance in psychopathy was partially driven by non-attention to costs.

Different operating modes (normal and hazard modes) may occur in the nominal process. In this article, we consider that the transition between different modes follows a Markov chain model with a certain transition probability. However, when the Stuxnet attack is launched, the attack signals with random multitude and frequency will be injected to trigger more hazard modes, and finally, hasten fatigue of control devices. Under this unpredictable attack, the transition between operating modes will not follow the regular transition probabilities. Therefore, a hidden Markov model with time-varying transition probabilities is utilized to describe the Stuxnet attack. The transition probabilities are estimated based on the measurements. By recognizing operating modes and predicting the number of the occurrence of hazard modes, the Stuxnet attack can be detected earlier if the predicted value exceeds the threshold. In the operating mode recognition, the expectation maximization algorithm is used to estimate the parameters considering random packet dropouts caused by the unreliable network.

Cardiac implants represent the most deployed types of IMD nowadays. Current solutions, to control their remote access, usually use a single feature for authentication. However, this feature is easily replicable, making these authentication schemes vulnerable to attacks. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this article a distance bounding protocol to manage access control of IMDs: ACIMD. ACIMD combines two security mechanisms, namely, identity verification (authentication) and proximity verification (distance checking). The authentication mechanism, formally and informally verified, conforms to the ISO/IEC 9798-2 standard. The distance checking is performed using the whole Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and relies on the correlation coefficient (comparing an external versus an internal ECG signal) in the Hadamard domain. We evaluate the accuracy and security of ACIMD access control using ECG signals of 199 individuals recorded over 24 hours while considering three adversary strategies.

While the advent of connected mobility is expected to benefit travelers and the society by smoothing traffic, improving rider convenience, and reducing accidents, the augmented cyber components in connected and autonomous vehicles and related infrastructure also give rise to cyber-attacks to the transportation system. And yet, little attention has been paid to transportation cyber resilience. This paper thus proposes an investigation on this topic with a comprehensive literature review. The cyber components and plausible autonomous mobility systems (AMS) operation scenarios are discussed, before identifying possible cyber-attacks to AMS at both vehicle and system levels. The discussion then moves to existing practices to enhance cybersecurity, and a number of strategies are investigated toward enhancing AMS cyber resilience. At the vehicle level, creating layers and separation to reduce cyber component connectivity and deploying an independent procedure for data collection and processing are important in vehicle design and manufacturing. At the system level, recommended strategies include keeping redundancy in transportation capacity, maintaining a separate road network, and deploying different sub-autonomous mobility systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102291373

How and why did this concept become entrenched in US doctrine? What are its effects? Focusing on the emergence and consolidation of this terminology, I make three arguments about the role of language in cybersecurity policy. First, I propose a new, politically consequential category of metaphor: foundational metaphors, implied by using particular labels rather than stated outright. These metaphors support specific ways to understand complex issues, provide discursive resources to some arguments over others, and shape policy contestation and outcomes. Second, I present a detailed empirical study of US military strategy and doctrine that traces the emergence and consolidation of terminology built on the cyberspace domain. This concept supported implicit metaphorical correspondences between the Internet and physical space, yielding specific analogies and arguments for understanding the Internet and its effects. Third, I focus on the rhetorical effects of this terminology to reveal two important institutional consequences: this language has been essential to expanding the military's role in cybersecurity, and specific interests within the Department of Defense have used this framework to support the creation of US Cyber Command. These linguistic effects in the United States also have implications for how other states approach cybersecurity, for how international law is applied to cyber operations, and for how International Relations understands language and technological change.

Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can be utilized to compensate such power variations due to their aggregated and controllable power consumptions. Meanwhile, one basic requirement for the users' side of TCLs is to realize the fair sharing of power states and comfort states. This article proposes a distributed event-based control strategy, where information of neighboring TCLs is exchanged only when a dynamic event-triggered condition is satisfied, and thus it intelligently determines the necessary transmission frequency to save communication resources. From a cybersecurity perspective, the communication network of TCLs may be subject to hybrid attacks, for example, denial-of-service (DoS) and false data-injection (FDI) attacks. During DoS attack intervals, no information can be communicated even through the event-triggered condition is satisfied. Furthermore, the control inputs may also be tampered by FDI attacks. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability and hybrid control theories, sufficient conditions regarding the attack parameters are derived such that fair sharing of power states and comfort states of all involved TCLs can be achieved exponentially. The exclusion of Zeno behaviors is proved and a corollary for ideal communication situations is also deduced. Finally, simulation examples with various attack parameters are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the main results. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119448830

This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020).

Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a robust security culture.

We identified five functional modules in FAIXID: (1) the pre-modeling explainability module that improves the quality of network traffic’s data through data cleaning; (2) the modeling module that provides explanations of the AI models to help analysts make sense of the model internals; (3) the post-modeling explainability module that provides additional explanations to enhance the understandability of the results produced by the AI models; (4) the attribution module that selects the appropriate explanations for the analysts according to their needs; and (5) the evaluation module that evaluates the explanations and collects feedback from analysts.

However, people are being affected due to cybersecurity threats. People can adhere to the recommended cybersecurity guidelines, rules, adopted standards, and cybercrime preventive measures to largely mitigate these threats. The ignorance of or lack of cybersecurity knowledge also causes a critical problem regarding confidentiality and privacy. It is not possible to fully avoid cybercrimes that often lead to sufficient business losses and spread forbidden themes (disgust, extremism, child porn, etc.). Therefore, to reduce the risk of cybercrimes, a web-based Blockchain-enabled cybersecurity awareness program (WBCA) process is introduced in this paper. The proposed WBCA trains users to improve their security skills. The proposed program helps with understanding the common behaviors of cybercriminals and improves user knowledge of cybersecurity hygiene, best cybersecurity practices, modern cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and trends. Furthermore, the proposed WBCA uses Blockchain technology to protect the program from potential threats. The proposed program is validated and tested using real-world cybersecurity topics with real users and cybersecurity experts. We anticipate that the proposed program can be extended to other domains, such as national or corporate courses, to increase the cybersecurity awareness level of users. A CentOS-based virtual private server is deployed for testing the proposed WBCA to determine its effectiveness. Finally, WBCA is also compared with other state-of-the-art web-based programs designed for cybersecurity awareness. © 2021 by the authors.

The concern of energy management is improved by providing connected and one-touch services with energy systems knowledge. External and internal attacks over the energy management systems degrade its performance by energy exploitations or increasing energy demands. This paper proposes an online security framework (OSF) for smart energy management systems (EMS). The proposed framework is responsible for monitoring EMS operations and mitigating security threats at different time intervals. The proposed OSF Monitoring aims to inform consumers of their use pattern, which uses energy Monitoring systems to store, analyze, and subsequently provide the systems to the service provider with valuable information. For this purpose, the proposed framework monitors the variations in energy distribution and consumption based on the routine factor. It then determines the variations based on the appliances/applications’ functional requirements using differential predictive learning. The OSF-based predictive learning performance monitoring is used to detect early faults, improve productivity, minimize downtime, and reduce energy costs. This helps align the distribution and consumption factors for different appliances to identify the fluctuating threats through fore-hand predictions. The entire process is administered using a centralized cybersecurity system coupled with the EMS.

The spread of fake news, misinformation, digital kidnapping, and ransomware-related crimes are amongst the most recurrent crimes in which manipulated digital photos and videos are the perpetrating and disseminating medium. Criminal investigation has been challenged in applying machine learning techniques to automatically distinguish between fake and genuine seized photos and videos. Despite the pertinent need for manual validation, easy-to-use platforms for digital forensics are essential to automate and facilitate the detection of tampered content and to help criminal investigators with their work. This paper presents a machine learning Support Vector Machines (SVM) based method to distinguish between genuine and fake multimedia files, namely digital photos and videos, which may indicate the presence of deepfake content. The method was implemented in Python and integrated as new modules in the widely used digital forensics application Autopsy. The implemented approach extracts a set of simple features resulting from the application of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to digital photos and video frames. The model was evaluated with a large dataset of classified multimedia files containing both legitimate and fake photos and frames extracted from videos. Regarding deepfake detection in videos, the Celeb-DFv1 dataset was used, featuring 590 original videos collected from YouTube, and covering different subjects. The results obtained with the 5-fold cross-validation outperformed those SVM-based methods documented in the literature, by achieving an average F1-score of 99.53%, 79.55%, and 89.10%, respectively for photos, videos, and a mixture of both types of content. A benchmark with state-of-the-art methods was also done, by comparing the proposed SVM method with deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Despite CNN having outperformed the proposed DFT-SVM compound method, the competitiveness of the results attained by DFT-SVM and the substantially reduced processing time make it appropriate to be implemented and embedded into Autopsy modules, by predicting the level of fakeness calculated for each analyzed multimedia file. © 2021 by the authors.

Evaluation results show that the approach allows learning from unlabelled data under challenging conditions for insider threat detection.

We have been witnessing the convergence of OT/IT networks, combined with massively distributed metering and control scenarios such as smart grids. Larger and geographically widespread attack surfaces, and inherently more data to analyse, will become the norm. Despite several advances in recent years, domain-specific security tools have been facing the challenges of trying to catch up with all the existing security flaws from the past, while also accounting for the specific needs of the next-generation of IACS. Moreover, the aggregation of multiple techniques and sources of information into a comprehensive approach has not been explored in depth. Such a holistic perspective is paramount since it enables a global and enhanced analysis enabled by the usage, combination and aggregation of the outputs from multiple sources and techniques. This paper starts by providing a review of the more recent anomaly detection techniques for SCADA systems, focused on both theoretical machine learning approaches and complete frameworks. Afterwards, it proposes a complete framework for an Intrusion and Anomaly Detection System (IADS) composed of specific detection probes, an event processing layer and a core anomaly detection component, amongst others. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of the framework within a large-scale hybrid testbed, and a comparison of different anomaly detection scenarios based on various machine learning techniques. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100501706

They promise a reduction in marine accidents and mitigation of human errors. Most of the ongoing research effort is directed toward autonomous navigation and cybersecurity. However, the importance of a machinery plant in the engine room that can operate reliably without human attendance is hardly investigated. To prevent failures in such systems and extend the interval between required human interventions, it is essential to improve their reliability. This paper aims to present a systematic approach to evaluate the reliability of an autonomous system under the influence of uncertain disruptions and to predict failure rates of unattended machinery plants. A Multinomial Process Tree is used to model failures in the main failure-sensitive components. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference is adopted to facilitate the prediction of frequencies of disruptive events and estimate the entire system's failure rate. The outcome of this research enables design strategies to improve the reliability of autonomous ships and prevent Fatal Technical Failure during the operation. This allows assessing whether a given machinery plant is sufficiently reliable to be used on unmanned ships. A case study is considered to demonstrate the application of the presented method. © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100492077

However, strengthening the security of an organization’s internal network may not be sufficient since modern organizations depend on third parties, and these dependencies may open new attack paths to cybercriminals. Cyber Third-Party Risk Management (C-TPRM) is a relatively new concept in the business world. All vendors or partners possess a potential security vulnerability and threat. Even if an organization has the best cybersecurity practice, its data, customers, and reputation may be at risk because of a third party. Organizations seek effective and efficient methods to assess their partners’ cybersecurity risks. In addition to intrusive methods to assess an organization’s cybersecurity risks, such as penetration testing, non-intrusive methods are emerging to conduct C-TPRM more easily by synthesizing the publicly available information without requiring any involvement of the subject organization. In this study, the existing methods for C-TPRM built by different companies are presented and compared to discover the commonly used indicators and criteria for the assessments. Additionally, the results of different methods assessing the cybersecurity risks of a specific organization were compared to examine reliability and consistency. The results showed that even if there is a similarity among the results, the provided security scores do not entirely converge. © 2021 by the authors.

A special emphasis is placed on emerging fit-for-purpose land administration solutions. The research synthesis uses reputable sources from the contemporary era. Results show the challenges of maintaining land administration systems and the data held are long recognized. The 1970s–1980s gave the issue impetus as data and processes moved from paper-based and manual to digital and automated. The 1990s recognized concerns on maintenance, albeit as a secondary issue: system establishment was the primary concern. The 2000s placed more emphasis on more holistic sociotechnical systems but, again maintenance was supplementary. The fit-for-purpose era deliveres a vast range of new social and technological innovations; however, scaled and sustainable implementations still struggle with system maintenance. From the findings, a consolidated model for analyzing maintenance problems and solutions at jurisdictional level is developed. Maintenance of a land administration system can be understood by identifying the level of change, method for change, components to change, and options for what to change to. The United Nations-endorsed Framework for Effective Land Administration is then used to identify specific maintenance challenges and available solutions. It is suggested that due to the scope and size of what can be considered maintenance issues, there exists no single solution—instead the country should identify its persistant maintenance problems, and the most appropriate solution set from the suite of available options. Emerging solutions and challenges include ensuring interlinkage to maintenance of spatial planning, land valuation, and marine administration; exploiting survey data ‘back capture’ initiatives; supporting grassroots IT; and giving serious attention to cybersecurity concerns. © 2021 by the authors.

Fortunately, cyber defense competitions are well-established and provide a critical window into what makes a cybersecurity team more or less effective. We examined data collected at the national finals and four regional events of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and posited that experience, access to simulation-based training, and functional role composition by the teams would predict team performance on four scoring dimensions relevant to the application of information assurance skills and defensive cyber operations: (a) maintaining services, (b) help-desk customer support, (c) handling scenario injects, and (d) mitigating red team attacks. Bayesian analysis highlighted that experience was a strong predictor of service availability, scenario injects, and red team defense. Simulation training was also associated with good performance along these scoring dimensions.

The proposed cyberattack detection system is first trained with current and voltage measurements representing various types of faults on the transmission lines. The cyberattack detection system is then employed to detect current and voltage measurements that are maliciously injected by an attacker to trigger the transmission line protective relays.

However, many cybersecurity awareness training (CSAT) programs fall short due to their misaligned training focuses. Design/methodology/approach: To help organizations develop effective CSAT programs, we have developed a theoretical framework for conducting a cost–benefit analysis of those CSAT programs. We differentiate them into three types of CSAT programs (constant, complementary and compensatory) by their costs and into four types of CSAT programs (negligible, consistent, increasing and diminishing) by their benefits. Also, we investigate the impact of CSAT programs with different costs and the benefits on a company's optimal degree of security. Findings: Our findings indicate that the benefit of a CSAT program with different types of cost plays a disparate role in keeping, upgrading or lowering a company's existing security level. Ideally, a CSAT program should spend more of its expenses on training employees to deal with the security threats at a lower security level and to reduce more losses at a higher security level.

This study aims to describe the responses from the health information systems (HIS) to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide empirical evidence in the application of emerging health technologies in China. Methods: This observational descriptive study utilized a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of hospitals in China (N = 1,014) from 30 provincial administrative regions across the country. Participants include hospital managers, hospital information workers, and health care providers. Results: Among all the responses, the most popular interventions and applications include expert question-and-answer sessions and science popularization (61.74%) in online medical consultation, online appointment registration (58.97%) in online medical service, and remote consultation (75.15%) in telehealth service. A total of 63.71% of the participating hospitals expanded their fever clinics during the pandemic, 15.38% hospitals used new or upgraded mobile ward rounds systems, and 44.68% hospitals applied online self-service systems. Challenges and barriers include protecting network information security (57.00%) since some hospitals experienced cybersecurity incidents. 71.79% participants hope to shorten wait time and optimize the treatment process. Health care workers experienced increased amount of work during the pandemic, while hospital information departments did not experience significant changes in their workload. Conclusion: In the process of fighting against the COVID-19, hospitals have widely used traditional and emerging novel HITs. These technologies have strengthened the capacity of prevention and control of the pandemic and provided comprehensive information technology support while also improving accessibility and efficiency of health care delivery. © 2021.

This article formulates the dynamic interaction between an intelligent spoof attacker and the wide-area damping control (WADC) center as a zero-sum two-player Markov game. In this Markov game, the attacker intelligently spoofs the communication links sending wide-area control signals to selected generators while the WADC selectively encrypts transmitted control signals with limited cyberresources. The successful spoof of specific communication links leads to the degradation of the WADC performance and even to system instability indicated by the real part of the targeted interarea oscillation mode. The potential performance degradation in the physical layer is uniquely included in the cost function of this game while the other two parts of the cost function are the cybersecurity investments of both the attacker and the WADC (defender). The minimax Q-learning approach is used to obtain the optimal defense and attack strategies. Simulation results show that the strategies for the attacker and the WADC converge within 3000 iterations by using the minimax Q-learning approach. The proposed Markov game provides a cyberphysical framework to make the optimal defense strategy for the WADC. © 2021 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102757431

Cyber deception is one of many solutions to protect critical documents after an attacker penetrates the network. It requires the generation and deployment of decoys such as fake text. The comprehensibility of a fake text document can affect the required time and effort for an attack to succeed. However, existing cybersecurity research has given limited attention to exploring the comprehensibility features of text for fake document generation. This article presents a novel method to generate believable fake text documents by measuring and manipulating the comprehensibility of legit text within a genetic algorithm (GA) framework. For measuring text comprehensibility, we adopt a set of quantitative measures based on qualitative principles of psycholinguistics and reading comprehension: connectivity, dispersion, and sequentiality. Our user-study analysis indicates that the quantitative comprehensibility measures can approximate the degree of human effort required to comprehend a fake text document in contrast to a legit text. For manipulating text comprehensibility, we develop a multiobjective, multimutation GA that modifies a legit document to Pareto-optimally alter its comprehensibility measures and generate hard-to-comprehend, believable fake documents. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates fake documents for a broader class of legit documents with varied text characteristics when compared to baselines from previous research. Hence, the application of our method can help improve cyber deception systems by providing more believable yet hard-to-comprehend fake documents to mislead cyber attackers. © 2021 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102755966

Both architectures are dependent on the reliability of their individual generators and a quantitative and realistic comparison of the overall system reliability of the two architectures is lacking. Using recently published work on emergency diesel generator finite reliability, a quantitative methodology is presented to compare the reliability of a microgrid architecture based on centralized emergency diesel generators to the traditional approach of generators tied to individual buildings. Three system reliability performance metrics are calculated as a function of outage duration: (1) probability to meet 100% of the critical load; (2) expected fraction of lost load; and (3) probability to meet the highest priority critical loads. It is shown that stand-alone building-tied emergency diesel generators systems, even when two emergency diesel generators are used per building, cannot provide the reliability required to sustain critical loads for a grid outage lasting multiple days. Due to their network configuration and ability to share load, diesel generator-based microgrid configurations are estimated to have ≥ 93% probability of powering all buildings for a 2-week outage there the individual building-tied emergency diesel generator architecture has a ≤20% probability.

Despite the increase in the number of research papers in these areas, scholarly articles defining cyber risk are relatively scarce. Moreover, the uniform broadly accepted definition of cyber risk has not been adopted yet, probably due to the interdisciplinary nature of this concept and the dynamics of its change. The paper contributes to the literature on the cyber risk, cybersecurity and cyber risk management. The author presents a comparative content analysis of existing definitions of cyber risk. Based on identification of three key characteristics of the cyber risk concept (source of cyber risk, cyber risk object, impact of cyber risk) in each definition, the analysed definitions are categorised as one-dimensional, two-dimensional or comprehensive definition. Among the collected 20 definitions of cyber risk, there is only one that can be called comprehensive. The remaining definitions address only selected aspects of this notion. The author proposes a new, comprehensive and universal definition of cyber risk. As an extension to the proposed approach, the ontological meta model of the cyber risk concept is developed. It supports deeper description of the cyber risk concept by depicting functional interdependencies with other terms and factors that constitute the cyber risk framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098851170

Once sensitive information is leaked, it may lead to serious effects. In this context, sensitive information leakage has long been a question of great interest in the field of cybersecurity. However, most sensitive information resides in unstructured data. Therefore, how to extract sensitive information from voluminous unstructured data has become one of the greatest challenges. To address the above challenges, we propose a method named ExSense for extracting sensitive information from unstructured data, which utilizes the content-based and context-based extract mechanism. On the one hand, the method uses regular matching to extract sensitive information with predictable patterns. On the other hand, we build a model named BERT-BiLSTM-Attention for extracting sensitive information with natural language processing. This model uses the latest BERT algorithm to accomplish word embedding and extracts sensitive information by using BiLSTM and attention mechanism, with an F1 score of 99.15%. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that ExSense has a higher detection rate than using individual methods (i.e., content analysis and context analysis). In addition, we analyze about a million texts on Pastebin, and the results prove that ExSense can extract sensitive information from unstructured data effectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098740671

In MEC, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine and extreme learning machine are separately designed as individual detectors for intrusion identification.

As an example, these cyber-attacks could interrupt physical industrial processes and cause potential injuries to workers.

Three use cases show specific threats in manufacturing as well as the SafeMan actions carried out to detect and mitigate them.

Compounding this issue, there is currently a documented gap between the cybersecurity and privacy risk assessment (RA) avenues, which are treated as distinct management processes and capitalise on rather rigid and make-like approaches. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds by proposing the APSIA (Automated Privacy and Security Impact Assessment) methodology, which stands for Automated Privacy and Security Impact Assessment. APSIA is powered by the use of interdependency graph models and data processing flows used to create a digital reflection of the cyber-physical environment of an organisation. Along with this model, we present a novel and extensible privacy risk scoring system for quantifying the privacy impact triggered by the identified vulnerabilities of the ICT infrastructure of an organisation. We provide a prototype implementation and demonstrate its applicability and efficacy through a specific case study in the context of a heavily regulated sector (i.e., assistive healthcare domain) where strict security and privacy considerations are not only expected but mandated so as to better showcase the beneficial characteristics of APSIA. Our approach can complement any existing security-based RA tool and provide the means to conduct an enhanced, dynamic and generic assessment as an integral part of an iterative and unified risk assessment process on-the-fly. Based on our findings, we posit open issues and challenges, and discuss possible ways to address them, so that such holistic security and privacy mechanisms can reach their full potential towards solving this conundrum. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the use of smart devices and communications in CAVs introduce new risks. CAVs would leverage vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, thus providing additional system access points compared to traditional systems. Automation makes these systems more vulnerable and increases the consequences of cyberattacks. This study utilizes an infrastructure-based communication platform consisting of cooperative adaptive cruise control and lane control advisories developed by the authors to perform cyber risk assessment of CAVs. The study emulates three types of cyberattacks (message falsification, dedicated denial of service, and spoofing attacks) in a representative traffic environment consisting of multiple CAV platoons and lane change events to analyze the safety and stability impacts of the cyberattacks. Simulation experiments using VISSIM reveals that traffic stream and CAV string is unstable under all three types of cyberattacks. The worst case is represented by the message falsification attack. Increases in volatility are observed over a no attack case, with variations increasing by an average of 43%–51% along with an increase of over 3000 crash conflicts. Similarly, lane change crash conflicts are observed to be more severe compared to rear end crash conflicts, showing a higher probability of severe injuries. Further, the case of slight cyberattack on a single CAV also creates significant disruption in the traffic stream. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals the statistical significance of the results.

Needless to say, in today’s dynamic, virtualized, and complex network environments, it has become undeniably necessary for network administrators, analysts as well as engineers to practice network vigilantism, on traffic as well as other network events in real-time. The reason is to understand the exact security posture of an organization’s network environment at any given time. This is driven by the fact that modern network environments do, not only present new opportunities to organizations but also a different set of new and complex cybersecurity challenges that need to be resolved daily. The growing size, scope, complexity, and volume of networked devices in our modern network environments also makes it hard even for the most experienced network administrators to independently provide the breadth and depth of knowledge needed to oversee or diagnose complex network problems. Besides, with the growing number of Cyber Security Threats (CSTs) in the world today, many organisations have been forced to change the way they plan, develop and implement cybersecurity strategies as a way to reinforce their ability to respond to cybersecurity incidents. This paper, therefore, examines the relevance of Real-Time Monitoring (RTM) as a supplementary security component of vigilantism in modern network environments, more especially for proper planning, preparedness, and mitigation in case of a cybersecurity incident.

The challenges exist because of three reasons; First, there is a lack of policy direction. Second, user values related to cybersecurity are not well understood. Third, there is a lack of clarity as to how IoT public policy should be developed. In this paper we argue that new IoT policy should be guided by key stakeholder values (i.e. what users think to be important). We utilize the Public Value Forum to elicit public values to inform decision-making surrounding IoT policy by public administrators, conceptually informed by Rational choice theory. We use a five-phase process to introduce the decision context (i.e. the policy problem), define fundamental objectives, rank these objectives, identify value-based trade-offs between them and construct a multi-attribute utility model. The findings indicate several key themes for IoT security from the citizens themselves and decision-making administrators in diverse public agencies developing IoT cybersecurity public policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091938398

The proposed framework uses multimodal encrypted biometric traits to perform authentication. It employs a combination of centralized and federated identity access techniques along with biometric based continuous authentication. The framework uses a fusion of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals when performing authentication. In addition to relying on the unique identification characteristics of the users’ biometric traits, the security of the framework is empowered by the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The use of HE allows patients’ data to stay encrypted when being processed or analyzed in the cloud. Thus, providing not only a fast and reliable authentication mechanism, but also closing the door to many traditional security attacks. The framework’s performance was evaluated and validated using a machine learning (ML) model that tested the framework using a dataset of 25 users in seating positions. Compared to using just ECG or PPG signals, the results of using the proposed fused-based biometric framework showed that it was successful in identifying and authenticating all 25 users with 100% accuracy. Hence, offering some significant improvements to the overall security and privacy of personalized healthcare systems. © 2021 by the authors.

In the main, organisations employ reactive approaches for cyber security, focused on rectifying immediate incidents and preventing repeat attacks, through protections such as vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, anti-spam/anti-malware solutions and system patches. Such system have weaknesses in addressing modern modern stealthy attacks. Proactive approaches, have been seen as part of the solution to this problem. However, approaches such as VAPT have limited scope and only works with threats that have already been discovered. Promising methods such as threat hunting are gaining momentum, enabling organisations to identify and rapidly respond to any potential attacks, though they have been criticised for their significant cost. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid model for uncovering tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through offensive security, specifically threat hunting via adversary emulation. The proposed technique is based on a novel approach of inducing adversary emulation (mapping each respective phase) model inside the threat hunting approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach uses threat hunting via adversary emulation and has countervailing effects on hunting advance level threats. Moreover, the threat detection ability of the proposed approach utilizes minimum resources. The proposed approach can be used to develop the offensive security-aware environment for organizations to uncover advanced attack mechanisms and test their ability for attack detection. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115282365

At the basic level (third level of organization maturity), there are generally no specific requirements for detailing, and it is sufficient to use the standard list of cyber risks classes. At the same time, the amount of risk assessment is not considered, which is acceptable for some types of basic level techniques. For example, the German BSI Standard1 contains a catalog of typical cyber-threats for component-information infrastructure. The advantage of such lists is the acceptable completeness level: classes, usually, are few (dozen), they are quite wide and consciously cover all existing sets of cyber risks. The disad-vantage is the difficulty in assessing the cyber risk level and the effectiveness of countermeasures for a wide class since it is more convenient to make settlements of the narrower (specific) risk classes. For example, ""router malfunction"" risk class can be divided into many subclasses, including possible types of malfunc-tion (vulnerability) of the software of the particular router and equipment mal-function. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

With its extensive usage in diverse scenarios, IoT devices generate bulk data contrived by attackers to disrupt normal operations and services. Hence, there is a need for proactive data analysis to prevent cyber-attacks and crimes. To investigate crimes involving Electronic Mail (e-mail), analysis of both the header and the email body is required since the semantics of communication helps to identify the source of potential evidence. With the continued growth of data shared via emails, investigators now face the daunting challenge of extracting the required semantic information from the bulks of emails, thereby causing a delay in the investigation process. This gives an edge to the criminal in erasing their footprints of malicious acts. The existing keyword-based search techniques and filtration often result in extraneous, short sequence emails, which skips meaningful information. To overcome the above limitation, we propose a novel efficient approach named SeFACED that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) for multiclass email classification. SeFACED not only works on short sequences but with long dependencies of 1000+ characters as well. SeFACED focuses on tuning LSTM based GRU parameters to attain the best performance and with assessment by comparing it with traditional machine learning, deep learning models, and state-of-the-art studies on the subject. Experimental results on self-extended benchmark datasets exhibit that SeFACED effectively outperforms existing methods while keeping the classification process robust and reliable. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110650556

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system, which is based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) model, to simultaneously localize and classify suspicious breast lesions from entire mammograms. The proposed system first preprocesses the raw images, then recognizes abnormal regions as breast lesions and determines their pathology classification as either mass or calcification.

Yet many AHC executives may not have sufficient knowledge of the potential impact of cyberattacks on institutional missions such as clinical care, research, and education. Improved cybersecurity awareness and education are areas of opportunity for many AHCs. Approach The authors developed and facilitated a tabletop cybersecurity simulation at an international conference for AHC leaders in September 2019 to raise awareness of cybersecurity issues and threats and to provide a forum for discussions of concerns specific to CEOs and C-suite-level executives. The 3.5-hour interactive simulation used an evolving, 3-phase case study describing a hypothetical cyberattack on an AHC with a ransomware demand. The approximately 70 participants, from AHCs spanning 25 states and 11 countries, worked in teams and discussed how they would react if they held roles similar to their real-life positions. The authors provide the full scenario as a resource. Outcomes The exercise was well received by the participants. In the postsession debrief, many participants noted that cybersecurity preparedness had not received the level of institutional attention given to threats such as epidemics or natural disasters. Significant variance in teams' courses of action during the simulation highlighted a lack of consensus with regard to foundational decisions. Participants identified this as an area that could be remedied by the development of guidelines or protocols. Next Steps As health care cybersecurity challenges persist or grow in magnitude, AHCs will have increased opportunities to lead in the development of best practices for preparedness and response. AHCs are well positioned to work with clinicians, security professionals, regulators, law enforcement, and other stakeholders to develop tools and protocols to improve health care cybersecurity and better protect patients. © 2020 by the Association of American Medical Colleges",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106969033

State estimation-based solutions provide a critical tool in monitoring and control of smart grids. Recently there has been an increased focus on false data injection attacks which can circumvent the traditional statistical bad data detection algorithm. Most of the research methodologies focus on the presence of FDIA in measurement set, whereas their exact locations remain unknown. To cater this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning architecture for detection of the exact locations of data intrusions in real-time. This deep learning model in association with traditional bad data detection algorithms is capable of detecting both structured as well as unstructured false data injection attacks. The deep learning architecture is not dependent on statistical assumptions of the measurements, it emphasizes on the inconsistency and co-occurrence dependency of potential attacks in measurement set, thus acting as a multilabel classifier. Such kind of architecture remains model free without any prior statistical assumptions. Extensive research work on IEEE test-bench shows that this scheme is capable of identifying the locations for intrusion under varying noise scenarios. Such kind of an approach shows potential results also in detection of presence of falsified data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106346421

It manifests as a weariness or aversion to cybersecurity-related workplace behaviors or advice and occurs as a result of prior overexposure to cybersecurity-related work demands or training. While some previous theoretical conceptualizations of cybersecurity fatigue are available, this article is the first to capture all dimensions of the phenomenon in a four-component model. The model holds that cybersecurity fatigue can result from overexposure to workplace cybersecurity advice (e.g., training) or cybersecurity actions (e.g., forced password updates). Similarly, we argue that there can be two types of cybersecurity fatigue: attitudinal (e.g., a belief that cybersecurity is not important) and cognitive (e.g., habituated bad behaviors). We present a multidisciplinary review, which draws on research from management, psychology, and information systems. Practitioners can use the four-component model to identify the type of cybersecurity fatigue that may be occurring in employees and adapt workplace processes accordingly to improve behavior. In addition, we present three illustrative case studies, adapted from employee experiences, to demonstrate the application of the four-component model to an organizational context.

Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems, thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal consequences for such systems. In this article, an adversarial example attack that triggers malfunctioning of NMS in OD models is proposed. The attack, namely, Daedalus, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalized to different OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications. Furthermore, a way of crafting robust adversarial examples is developed by using an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the pervasive nature of model reuse in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples crafted based on an ensemble of substitutes can launch attacks without knowing the parameters of the victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes. As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate in detection results to 99.9&#x0025; and reduces the mean average precision scores to 0, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It also demonstrates that the attack can be practically launched against real-world OD systems via printed posters. IEEE",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099195781

However, the security of the IoT ecosystem remains an afterthought for most IoT providers. This action results in many cybersecurity breaches in the field, most likely due to the lack of access control mechanisms. In this paper, we propose BorderChain, an access control framework based on blockchain for IoT endpoints. The security protocol guarantees two properties. First, our proposal assures IoT users and services that they communicate with approved IoT gateways as endpoints, holding verified IoT devices that they need. Second, BorderChain also generates access tokens that the IoT service and users can use to query IoT resources legitimately inside the IoT domains. As a result, the protocol can convince IoT domain owners that the system will only authorize IoT requests that they approve. We realize our protocol in the form of a smart contract to allow many IoT entities such as IoT domain owners, IoT devices, IoT gateways, IoT vendors, IoT services, IoT users, and Internet Service Provider (ISP) to collaborate in a unified environment. We then implement entities in BorderChain as Node JS applications connecting to the Ethereum blockchain as our peer-to-peer platform. Based on our performance evaluation using several Raspberry Pi hardware and our private server, we show that BorderChain can process entities' authentication and authorization requests efficiently using all hardware resources.

The common properties of embedded systems, such as mobility, small size, low cost, independence, and limited power consumption when compared to traditional computer systems, have caused many challenges in CSES. The conflict between cybersecurity requirements and the computing capabilities of embedded systems makes it critical to implement sophisticated security countermeasures against cyber-attacks in an embedded system with limited resources, without draining those resources. In this study, twelve factors influencing CSES have been identified: (1) the components; (2) the characteristics; (3) the implementation; (4) the technical domain; (5) the security requirements; (6) the security problems; (7) the connectivity protocols; (8) the attack surfaces; (9) the impact of the cyber-attacks; (10) the security challenges of the ESs; (11) the security solutions; and (12) the players (manufacturers, legislators, operators, and users).

This will enable cybersecurity practitioners to conduct an assessment of their systems with regard to twelve identified cybersecurity aspects. In MuLFESC, the feedback from the system-components layer to the system-operations layer could help implement 'Security by Design' in the design stage at the bottom layer.

We examine how the board’s gender composition can influence the extent of such disclosure, based on a sample of the companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 Index over the period 2014–2018. Results show evidence of a positive association between the presence and level of cybersecurity disclosure and board gender diversity.

Our findings contribute to the debate on the importance of gender diversity by adding the concept of the positive influence of heterogeneity on cyber disclosure. We also augment the literature on the critical mass of women in boardrooms by providing empirical evidence that three or more women constitute the threshold for better governance. Our study has important implications for investors, stakeholders and regulators. If investors wish to increase cybersecurity disclosure, they should ask for more diversified boards.

A collaborative detection system allows multiple collaborators or service providers to share their security-incident-response data, in order to effectively identify and isolate stealthy malicious actors who hide their traffic under the umbrella of legitimate Internet data transmissions. The fundamental challenge in the design of a collaborative system is ensuring the privacy of collaborators in a decentralized setting without incurring substantial computation and communication overheads. In this paper, we use healthcare as a case study and present Sharing Is Caring (SIC), a framework that allows multiple healthcare organizations to share their security defense and attack data with other organizations for the collaborative defense against common attackers without compromising the privacy of their system configurations and user data. The SIC framework ensures two essential properties: (1) it ensures that no party should learn how a particular healthcare organization has reacted to suspected IP addresses, attacks or security incidents; and (2) it performs operations in a decentralized setting, without relying on a trusted third party. We provide an analysis of the privacy and security properties of our framework against honest-but-curious as well as malicious players. We prototype the proposed system and evaluate its performance in terms of computation time and communication bandwidth.

It is an effortless way for people to enhance their communication, connect with like-minded people, and share ideas. Online social networks (OSNs) can be used for noble causes by bringing together communities with common shared interests and to promote awareness of various causes. However, there is a dark side to the use of OSNs. OSNs can also be used as a coordination and amplification platform for attacks. For instance, adversaries can increase the impact of an attack by causing panic in an area by promoting attacks using OSNs. Public data can help adversaries to determine the best timing for attacks, scheduling attacks, and then using OSNs to coordinate attacks on networks or physical locations. This convergence of the cyber and physical worlds is known as cybernetics. In this paper, we introduce an integrated method to identify malicious behavior and the actors responsible for propagating this behavior via online social networks. Throughout history we have used surveillance techniques to monitor negative behavior, activities, and information. Quantitative socio-technical methods such as deviant cyber flash mob (DCFM) detection and focal structure analysis (FSA) can provide reconnaissance capabilities that enable cities and governments to look beyond internal data and identify threats based on active events. Groups of powerful hackers can be identified through FSA which is an integrated model that uses a betweenness centrality method at the node-level and spectral modularity at group-level to identify a hidden malicious and powerful focal structure (a subset of the network). Assessment of groups using DCFM methods can help to identify powerful actors and prevent attacks. In this study, we examine multiple data sets integrating the DCFM and FSA models to help cybersecurity experts see a better picture of the threat which will help to plan a better response. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090847334

The proposed MCGDM algorithm aggregates the data, determines the optimal weights for criteria and ranks alternatives with no further input. The intervals give flexibility to experts in assessing alternatives against criteria and provide an opportunity to gain maximum information. We also propose a novel method to aggregate experts’ judgements using cloud models. We introduce an experimental approach to check the validity of the aggregation method. After that, we use the aggregation method for an MCGDM problem. Here, we find the optimal weights for each criterion by proposing a bi-level optimisation model. Then, we extend the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for data based on cloud models to prioritise alternatives. As a result, the algorithm can gain information from decision-makers with different levels of uncertainty and examine alternatives with no more information from decision-makers. The proposed MCGDM algorithm is implemented on a case study of a cybersecurity problem to illustrate its feasibility and effectiveness.

This paper problematizes both information security governance and the broader concept of governance. What does it mean to govern information security, or for that matter, anything? Why have information technologies proven difficult to govern? And what assurances can governance provide for the billions of people who rely on information technologies every day? Drawing together several distinct bodies of literature—including multiple strands of governance theory, actor–network theory, and scholarship on sociotechnical regimes—this paper conceptualizes networked action on a spectrum from uncertain governance to governing uncertainty. I advance a twofold argument. First, I argue that networks can better govern uncertainty as they become more able not only to enroll actors in a collective agenda, but also to cut ties with those who seek to undermine that agenda. And second, I argue that the dominant conception of information security governance, which emphasizes governing uncertainty through risk management, in practice devolves to uncertain governance. This is largely because information technologies have evolved toward greater connectedness—and with it, greater vulnerability—creating a regime of insecurity. This evolution is illustrated using the history of the US government’s efforts to govern information security. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078716947

At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network's operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system's characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework's performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES. Results confirm that the developed LSTM-based attack detection model has a generalization ability to catch modern power grids’ dynamic behaviors, excelling current traditional approaches in the designed case studies and achieves accuracy higher than 90% in all experiments. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117711985

Some studies have indicated that deep neural networks are sensitive in detecting adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are instances with certain perturbations that cause deep neural networks to misclassify.

The information seekers could face health risks if they are not proficient in OHI literacy. The OHI-seeking behaviors and skills of Chinese college students, the largest proportion of college students in the world, are understudied. This study was aimed to describe OHI-seeking behaviors and skills of college students in Guangdong, China. Methods: College students in the Guangdong province with OHI-seeking experience were invited via WeChat, QQ, and Sina Weibo using QR code posters and flyers for participation in this online anonymized questionnaire-based study. Data on demographics, OHI literacy, information resources, search approaches, and behaviors were collected. The relationship between perceived OHI literacy and high-risk behaviors was investigated by bivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Respondents were 1203 college students with a mean age of 20.6 years, females (60.2%), and undergraduates (97.2%). They sought health information via websites (20.3%), WeChat (2.6%), or both (77.1%). Baidu was the main search engine, and baike.baidu.com (80.3%), Zhihu.com (48.4%), and Zhidao.baidu.com (35.8%) were top three among 20 searched websites for information about self-care (80.7%), general health (79.5%), disease prevention (77.7%), self-medication (61.2%), family treatment (40.9%), drugs (37.7%), western medications (26.6%), hospitals (22.7%), physicians (21.4%), and Traditional Chinese Medicine (15.6%). Despite most respondents (78%) lacked confidence in the evidence quality and satisfaction with the results, only 32.4% further consulted doctors. Many (> 50%) would recommend the retrieved information to others. About 20% experienced hacking/Internet fraud. Cronbach’s alpha for the internal consistency of OHI literacy was 0.786. Bivariate logistic regression analysis showed that students who believed they can judge the evidence level of OHI were more likely to self-diagnose (OR = 2.2, 95%CI, 1.6–3.1) and look for drug usage (OR = 3.1, 95%CI, 1.9–5.0). Conclusions: This study reveals Chinese college students’ heavy reliance on OHI to manage their own and others’ health without sufficient knowledge/skills to identify misinformation and disinformation. The apparent risky information-seeking behaviors of Chinese college students warrant the provision of regulated, accurate, and actionable health information; assurance of cybersecurity; and health information literacy promotion in colleges by concerned authorities. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104403611

These devices frequently employ a combination of peroxide based explosives as well as nitramines, nitrates, and nitroaromatics. Detection of these explosives can be challenging due to varying chemical composition and the extremely low vapor pressures exhibited by some explosive compounds. No electronic trace detection system currently exists that is capable of continuously monitoring both peroxide based explosives and certain nitrogen based explosives, or their precursors, in the vapor phase. Recently, we developed a thermodynamic sensor that can detect a multitude of explosives in the vapor phase at the parts-per-trillion (ppt) level. The sensors rely on the catalytic decomposition of the explosive and specific oxidation–reduction reactions between the energetic molecule and metal oxide catalyst; i.e. the heat effects associated with catalytic decomposition and redox reactions between the decomposition products and catalyst are measured. Improved sensor response and selectivity were achieved by fabricating free-standing, ultrathin film (1 µm thick) microheater sensors for this purpose. The fabrication method used here relies on the interdiffusion mechanics between a copper (Cu) adhesion layer and the palladium (Pd) microheater sensor. A detailed description of the fabrication process to produce a free-standing 1 µm thick sensor is presented. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103186317

Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a methodology that uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to calculate scores and the likelihood of occurrence based on communication frequencies to ultimately determine risk categories for different paths in a construction network. As a proof of concept, the proposed methodology is implemented in a construction network from a real project found in the literature. Findings: Results show that the proposed methodology could provide valuable information to assist project participants to assess the overall cybersecurity vulnerability of construction and assist during the vulnerability-management processes. For example, a project owner can use this information to get a better understanding of what to do to limit its vulnerability, which will lead to the overall improvement of the security of the construction network. Research limitations/implications: It has to be noted that the scoring systems, the scores and categories adopted in the study need not necessarily be an exact representation of all the construction participants or networks. Therefore, caution should be exercised to avoid generalizing the results of this study. Practical implications: The proposed methodology can provide valuable information and assist project participants to assess the overall cyber-vulnerability of construction projects and support the vulnerability-management processes. For example, a project owner can use this approach to get a better understanding of what to do to limit its cyber-vulnerability exposure, which will ultimately lead to the overall improvement of the construction network's security. This study will also help raise more awareness about the cybersecurity implications of the digitalization and automation of the AEC industry among practitioners and construction researchers. Social implications: Given the amount of digitized services and tools used in the AEC industry, cybersecurity is increasingly becoming critical for society in general. In some cases, (e.g. critical infrastructure) incidents could have significant economic and societal or public safety implications. Therefore, proper consideration and action from the AEC research community and industry are needed.

Modern communication network technologies have enormous growth in the cyber threats and masquerading attacks to steal data. Hence concepts and mechanisms are built and made into regulations for a safer environment. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often known as drones, are becoming increasingly common, posing new problems in areas such as monitoring, agriculture, weather prediction, surveillance and other fields. This includes a large number of devices that, owing to a lack of energy or a system shutdown, might occasionally send incorrect signals and must be monitored autonomously by drones in remote regions. In this paper, we propose a energy intensive blockchain-based platform for controlling drone operations while ensuring trust and security for all parties involved. The goal of this paper is to explore the extent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) vulnerability to deceptive (Global Navigation Satellite System) GNSS signals by establishing the necessary conditions for UAV via GPS (Global Positioning System) spoofing. The existing algorithms used to mitigate spoofing attacks have unbounded long-term errors, which increase in time during its performance. An innovative idea is necessitating to eliminate those errors, thereby in the proposed work, Ethereum Blockchain has been implemented to create a blockchain network to mitigate the spoofing attacks. Blockchains are incredibly popular nowadays and is the basic technology for cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology greatly impacts the applications in UAVs. The proposed methodology uses the network that has to be registered in the aerospace components through the ledger associated with relevant data communication in the Blockchain. When an intruder gets acquired with the data in the network with a single block, it cannot affect the entire network due to the data integrity in the ledgers that has been cryptographically assigned. The blockchain network intermittently verifies the geolocation data so that any outlying data would be detected and eliminated quickly. The data that has been verified is made available for the view of aviation and spacecraft operations through the distributed network. The proposed methodology outperforms the existing methods in intense drift error and, in the case of confidentiality and integrity, it has very low risk when compared to existing methods. © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119878224

A high energy system resilience is of utmost importance to modern societies that are highly dependent on continued access to energy services. This review covers the terminology of energy system resilience and the assessment of a broad landscape of threats mapped with the proposed framework. A more detailed discussion on two specific threats are given: extreme weather, which is the cause for most of the energy supply disruptions, and cyberattacks, which still are a minor, but rapidly increasing concern. The framework integrates various perspectives on energy system threats by showcasing interactions between the parts of the energy system and its environment. Weather-related threats are discussed distinguishing relevant meteorological parameters and different durations of disruptions, increasingly related to the impacts of the climate change. Extremes in space weather caused by solar activity are very rare, but are nonetheless considered due to their potentially catastrophic impacts on a global scale. Digitalization of energy systems, e.g. through smart grids important to renewable electricity utilization, may as such improve resilience from traditional weather and technical failure threats, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Major differences between the internet and smart grids limit the applicability of existing cybersecurity solutions to the energy sector. Other structural energy system changes will likely bring new threats, which call for updating the threat landscape for expected system development scenarios. © 2021 The Authors",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110211234

There is abundant evidence of SCADA systems being subject to cyberattacks. With increasing interest in industrial digitization, the cybersecurity of SCADA systems is poised to be even more important. Equipment faults and cyberattacks can manifest themselves in a similar fashion, i.e., they can exhibit similar signatures. This article focuses on methods that are capable of distinguishing equipment faults from bona fide cyberattacks. Especially, we consider a relatively sophisticated form of cyberattack known as the 'replay attack' (RA). We derive mathematical formalisms that distinguish the RA from several classes of equipment faults and verify our methodology through an extensive numerical study. Note to Practitioners-This article is motivated by the problem of detecting replay cyberattacks in industrial control systems and differentiating it from equipment faults. Existing approaches mainly focus on the detection aspect but usually ignore the importance of differentiation. We an ensembled statistical process monitoring approach based on five statistical metrics. The statistical metrics are derived based on a theoretical analysis that shows the data characteristics under each system anomaly, including replay attack (RA), controller fault, and plant fault. We mathematically prove that the signatures generated by the derived metrics can be used to differentiate an RA from the equipment faults. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the detection delay of our method regarding the magnitude of the cyberattack. Physical experiments on a rotating machinery setup show that the proposed approach applies to some simple real-world settings. In future research, we will address the scalability issue of our method as well as more generalized nonlinear system settings. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090454102

At the same time, a growing number of information security incidents is being observed including the occurrence of unauthorized accesses, also named intrusions. As a consequence of these two developments, Information and Communications services providers require automated processes to detect and solve such intrusions, and this should done quickly in order to keep the related cybersecurity risks at acceptable levels. However, the presence of large volumes of data negatively interferes with the performance of classifiers used in intrusion detection tasks, which limits their applicability in practical cases. The research reported in this paper focuses on proposing a novel feature selection algorithm for intrusion detection scenarios. To this end, an extensive literature review was executed to first discover issues in the feature selection algorithms reported. Based on the insights obtained, the new multi-measure feature selection algorithm was designed that uses qualitative information provided by multiple feature selection measures, and reduces the dimensionality of the training data set. The algorithm proposed was next extensively tested using various data sets. It provides greater efficacy than other feature selection algorithms used for intrusion detection purposes.

Bitcoin transactions make use of peer-to-peer network nodes without a third-party intermediary, and the transactions can be verified by the node. Although Bitcoin networks have exhibited high efficiency in the financial transaction systems, their payment transactions are vulnerable to several ransomware attacks. For that reason, investigators have been working on developing ransomware payment identification techniques for bitcoin transac-tions’ networks to prevent such harmful cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose a high performance Bitcoin transaction predictive system that investigates the Bitcoin payment transactions to learn data patterns that can recognize and classify ransomware payments for heterogeneous bitcoin networks. Specifically, our system makes use of two supervised machine learning methods to learn the dis-tinguishing patterns in Bitcoin payment transactions, namely, shallow neural networks (SNN) and optimizable decision trees (ODT). To validate the effectiveness of our solution approach, we evaluate our machine learning based predictive models on a recent Bitcoin transactions dataset in terms of classification accuracy as a key performance indicator and other key evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, positive predictive value, true positive rate, and the corresponding prediction errors. As a result, our superlative experimental result was registered to the model-based decision trees scoring 99.9% and 99.4% classification detection (two-class classifier) and accuracy (multiclass classifier), respectively. Hence, the obtained model accuracy results are superior as they surpassed many state-of-the-art models developed to identify ransomware payments in bitcoin transactions. © 2021 by the authors.

Potential cyberattacks can deteriorate microgrid performances by corrupting and intercepting data exchanges among participating DERs, whereby microgrids deviate from desired operating conditions and stable microgrid operations are jeopardized. In this paper, a cross-layer control strategy is proposed to enhance the microgrid resilience against false data injection (FDI) and denial of service (DoS) attacks. On the one hand, the proposed control strategy will not interfere with microgrid normal operations when there are no cyberattacks. On the other hand, the proposed control strategy can effectively mitigate the impacts of FDI and DoS attacks on microgrids without relying on prompt detection and isolation of cyberattacks. The stability of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated using the Lyapunov theory under different scenarios, including without and with FDI and DoS attacks.

The central U.S. response to this challenge has been a series of sectoral “partnerships” with private owner-operators of critical infrastructure, involving varying degrees of regulation. Qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews with over 40 policymakers and senior private sector managers, as well as public documents, reveals considerable variation in how well this approach has worked in practice.

However, other factors—such as the nature of intra-industry competition—also affect how well the current regime works in specific sectors.

Cybersecurity researchers are also starting to experiment with fear appeals, many reporting positive outcomes. Yet there are ethical concerns related to the use of fear to motivate action. In this paper, we explore this aspect from the perspectives of cybersecurity fear appeal deployers and recipients. We commenced our investigation by considering fear appeals from three foundational ethical perspectives. We then consulted the two stakeholder groups to gain insights into the ethical concerns they consider to be pertinent. We first consulted deployers: (a) fear appeal researchers and (b) Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), and then potential cybersecurity fear appeal recipients: members of a crowdsourcing platform. We used their responses to develop an effects-reasoning matrix, identifying the potential benefits and detriments of cybersecurity fear appeals for all stakeholders. Using these insights, we derived six ethical principles to guide cybersecurity fear appeal deployment. We then evaluated a snapshot of cybersecurity studies using the ethical principle lens. Our contribution is, first, a list of potential detriments that could result from the deployment of cybersecurity fear appeals and second, the set of six ethical principles to inform the deployment of such appeals. Both of these are intended to inform cybersecurity fear appeal design and deployment. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092772036

As a result, they can also constrain ethical reasoning about new technologies, by uncritically carrying over assumptions about moral roles and obligations from an existing domain. The discussion of global governance of cybersecurity problems has to date been dominated by the metaphor of ‘cyber war’. In this paper, I argue that this metaphor diminishes possibilities for international collaboration in this area by limiting states to reactive policies of naming and shaming rather than proactive actions to address systemic features of cyberspace.

Recent studies suggested that 85% of breaches involved a human element and the frequent patterns used are social engineerings. Therefore, many studies focus on making a better understanding of human behavior in cybersecurity and the factors that affect cybersecurity practices. However, there are only a few peer-reviewed studies that focus on the link between stress level and cybersecurity practices. In this study, we examined the link between stress level and cybersecurity practices among hospital employees in Indonesia by surveying 99 hospital workers. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used to measure the employees' stress level and a new scale to measure hospital staff's risky cybersecurity practices was proposed. This study showed that both PSS and proposed cybersecurity practices scales are reliable with Cronbach's α value of more than 0.7. The survey results also revealed that hospital worker's higher stress levels correlate significantly with riskier cybersecurity practices (rs = 0.305, p < 0.01). Besides, a higher stress level is also significantly linked to certain cybersecurity practices, such as clicking on a link in an email from an unknown sender, not preventing colleagues from viewing patients' information for a non-therapeutic purpose, posting patient information on social media, ignoring colleagues who engage in negative information security practices, and failing to create strong passwords. © 2021 Owner/Author.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113225025

To combat threats, SMEs must first be willing and able to assess their cybersecurity posture. Cybersecurity risk assessment, generally performed with the help of metrics, provides the basis for an adequate defense. Significant challenges remain, however, especially in the complex socio-technical setting of SMEs. Seemingly basic questions, such as how to aggregate metrics and ensure solution adaptability, are still open to debate. Aggregation and adaptability are vital topics to SMEs, as they require the assimilation of metrics into an actionable advice adapted to their situation and needs. To address these issues, we systematically review socio-technical cybersecurity metric research in this paper. We analyse aggregation and adaptability considerations and investigate how current findings apply to the SME situation. To ensure that we provide valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, we integrate our results in a novel socio-technical cybersecurity framework geared towards the needs of SMEs. Our framework allowed us to determine a glaring need for intuitive, threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment approaches for the least digitally mature SMEs. In the future, we hope our framework will help to offer SMEs some deserved respite by guiding the design of suitable cybersecurity assessment solutions. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112609036

There are many challenges in the robot’s communication with the environment, widely described in the literature on the subject. The threats that scientists believe have the most significant impact on the robot’s communication include denial‐of‐service (DoS) attacks, satellite signal spoofing, external eavesdropping, spamming, broadcast tampering, and man‐in‐the‐middle attacks. In this article, the authors attempted to identify communication threats in the new robot‐to‐infrastructure (R2I) model based on available solutions used in transport, e.g., vehicle‐to‐infrastructure (V2I), taking into account the threats already known affecting the robot’s sensory systems. For this purpose, all threats that may occur in the robot’s communication with the environment were analyzed. Then the risk analysis was carried out, determining, in turn, the likelihood of potential threats occurrence, their consequence, and ability of detection. Finally, specific methods of responding to the occurring threats are proposed, taking into account cybersecurity aspects. A critical new approach is the proposal to use communication and protocols so far dedicated to transport (IEEE 802.11p WAVE, dedicated short‐range communications (DSRC)). Then, the companion’s robot should be treated as a pedestrian and some of its sensors as an active smartphone. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the greatest challenges in the automotive sector is to make the vehicle secure and reliable. In fact, there are more connected instruments on a vehicle, such as the infotainment system and/or data interchange systems. Indeed, with the advent of new paradigms, such as Smart City and Smart Road, the vision of Internet of Things has evolved substantially. Today, we talk about the V2X systems in which the vehicle is strongly connected with the rest of the world. In this scenario, the main aim of all connected vehicles vendors is to provide a secure system to guarantee the safety of the drive and persons against a possible cyber‐attack. So, in this paper, an embedded Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the automotive sector is introduced. It works by adopting a two‐step algorithm that provides detection of a possible cyber‐attack. In the first step, the methodology provides a filter of all the messages on the Controller Area Network (CAN‐Bus) thanks to the use of a spatial and temporal analysis; if a set of messages are possibly malicious, these are analyzed by a Bayesian network, which gives the probability that a given event can be classified as an attack. To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, an experimental campaign was conducted to evaluate them, according to the classic evaluation parameters for a test’s accuracy. These results were compared with a common data set on cyber‐attacks present in the literature. The first experimental results, obtained in a test scenario, seem to be interesting. The results show that our method has good correspondence in the presence of the most common cyber‐attacks (DDoS, Fuzzy, Impersonating), obtaining a good score relative to the classic evaluation parameters for a test’s accuracy. These results have decreased performance when we test the system on a Free State Attack. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the inherent interconnectivity, IoT devices are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, cryptographic primitives can be employed, but they require significant computation, which restricts their adoption in IoT. Moreover, IoT systems have diverse requirements, ranging from high-throughput (TP) to the area constrained. This makes it hard to deploy appropriate security measures in a systematic manner. To address these issues, three generic implementation strategies (unrolled, round-based, and serialized) are proposed for developing highly efficient hardware architectures. They are applicable to all authenticated encryption schemes and are lightweight and fast, compared to conventional public key encryption. In this article, Ascon is implemented as an example based on those three strategies: 1) the unrolled architecture achieves TP of 766.9 Mb/s (Ascon-128) and 1389.2 Mb/s (Ascon-128a), which are suitable for high-throughput IoT applications; 2) the round-based architecture achieves 0.153 (Ascon-128) and 0.244 (Ascon-128a) TP-to-area ratio, which are, respectively, 73.8% and 40.2% better than state-of-the-art results; and 3) a novel serialized implementation technique is proposed wherein the substitution-box (S-box) is processed in multiple-bit-per-cycle, in contrast to the conventional one-bit-per-cycle approach. The TP of the two-bits-per-clock-cycle implementation is increased by 230.8% with only 36.8% additional hardware area. The proposed strategies allow us to scale the number of rounds (round-based) and bits-per-clock-cycle (serialized) to meet differing requirements in TP and area which are demonstrated for smart city IoT applications. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099725313

The main contribution of this work is a dataset coming from a real-world, academic network. Real-life traffic was collected and, after performing a series of attacks, a dataset was assembled. The dataset contains 44 network features and an unbalanced distribution of classes. In this work, the capability of the dataset for formulating machine-learning-based models was experimentally evaluated. To investigate the stability of the obtained models, cross-validation was performed, and an array of detection metrics were reported. The gathered dataset is part of an effort to bring security against novel cyberthreats and was completed in the SIMARGL project. © 2021 by the authors.

Most existing impact assessment studies are scenario-based where derived results are scenario specific and not generalizable. Moreover, stochasticity in temporal behavior of multiple spatially distributed PVs requires a large number of scenarios to be simulated that increases with the size of the network and the level of penetration. Therefore, we propose a new computationally efficient analytical framework of voltage sensitivity analysis that allows for stochastic analysis of voltage change due to random changes in PV generation. We derive an analytical approximation for voltage change at any node of the network due to a change in power at other nodes in an unbalanced distribution network. Then, we derive the probability distribution of voltage change at a certain node due to random changes in power injections/consumptions at multiple locations of the network. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated using a modified version of IEEE 37 bus and IEEE 123 bus test systems. The proposed framework can serve as a powerful tool for proactive monitoring/control of voltage, and ease the computational burden associated with perturbation based cybersecurity mechanisms. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100460366

We reformulate the problem to find a Nash equilibrium using an efficient, sequence-form linear program. Solving this linear program produces optimal defender strategies for the multi-domain security game. We address large problem instances with an application of the approximate counterfactual regret minimization algorithm. This approximation reduces computation time by 95% while maintaining an optimality gap of less than 3%. Our application of discounted counterfactual regret results in a further 36% reduction in computation time from the base algorithm. We develop domain insights through a designed experiment to explore the parameter space of the problem and algorithm. We also address robust opponent exploitation by combining existing techniques to extend the counterfactual regret algorithm to include a discounted, constrained variant.

To prove this hypothesis with Thai employees, this paper presents a comparative study of cybersecurity awareness enhancement associated with the employees who work in different departments within the same organization in Bangkok, Thailand. In this study, the first phishing attack simulation was conducted before providing knowledge and training in cybersecurity to the employees and attacking with the second simulation. After result collection and analysis, it has been found that there are significant differences in cybersecurity awareness level between Thai employees from technology-based departments (e.g., IT department) and social-based departments (e.g., HR department) within the same organization. Of course, the technology-based employees are the better. Furthermore, it has been found that the cybersecurity awareness level of Thai employees from the social-based department, which were poor when compared to the other one, was improved obviously after they were involved with the cybersecurity awareness enhancement processes. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114851712

We performed semi-structured interviews of patients, clinicians, and device clinic technicians involved in clinical remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable devices at our institution. Twenty-eight interviews comprised of 15 patients and 13 clinicians were conducted from October 2019 through February 2020. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Perspectives among clinicians and patients varied regarding familiarity, educational experiences, and preferences regarding how remote monitoring data are handled. Three key domains emerged including knowledge and understanding, managing alerts, and cost transparency. Within these domains, key findings includedvery limited understanding of how remote monitoring functions and how alerts in particular are handled. These knowledge deficits (both patients and providers) appeared to arise in part from different equipment and platforms among manufacturers, the complexity of the technology, and lack of formalized education in remote monitoring. However, interviewees expressed generally high levels of trust in the technology and care systems supporting remote monitoring. Few respondents described concerns around cybersecurity, but patients in particular did raise concerns about cost transparency and frequent billing. In conclusion, conflicting perceptions around remote monitoring persist and indicate important knowledge gaps despite high trust in the care pathway. This qualitative analysis offers insight into patient and clinician understanding of and attitudes toward remote monitoring, and may guide future efforts to improve education and patient-centeredness of remote monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103950133

A weak voltage profile can not only reduce the power-quality services, but can also result in system instability in severe cases. The cybersecurity of EAFs is becoming a significant concern due to their cyber-physical structure. The reliance of SVC controllers on reactive power measurement and network communications has resulted in a cyber-vulnerability point for unauthorized access to the EAF, which can affect its normal operation. This paper addresses concerns about cyber attacks on EAFs, which can cause network communication issues in measurement data for SVCs. Three significant and different types of cyber attacks that are launched on SVC controllers—a replay attack, delay attack, and false data injection attack (FDIA)—were simulated and investigated. In order to stop the activities of cyber attacks, a secured anomaly detection model (ADM) based on a prediction interval is proposed. The proposed model is dependent on a support vector regression and a new smooth cost function for constructing the optimal and symmetrical intervals. A modified algorithm based on teaching–learning-based optimization was developed to adapt the ADM’s parameters during training. The simulation’s outcomes on a genuine dataset showed the strong capability of the proposed model against cyber attacks in EAFs. © 2021 by the authors.

Our study aims were: to review the current use and applicability of telemedicine; evaluate its suitability, safety and effectiveness in a surgical outpatient setting, particularly in the era of social distancing restrictions and provide insight into future applications. Methods: Databases searched included: PubMed, OVID Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and review of reference lists. Key words used were “telemedicine”; “telehealth”; “videoconference”; “outpatient” and “surgical clinic”. For inclusion, articles required to be in English, published between 2000 and 2021, were in an outpatient surgical setting and if they had a focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: 335 articles were identified and screened, so that 63 articles were included in the review. Almost all articles were from Western countries (n = 60), mostly in surgical journals (n = 35) and from a range of sub-specialities, but pre-dominantly orthopaedics (n = 12) and general surgery (n = 7). The majority were original comparative studies where 31 studies directly compared telemedicine to in-person appointments and 14 papers focused on implementation during COVID-19. Discussion/conclusions: Telemedicine has been safely used across various phases of surgical outpatient care, with its effectiveness evaluated by clinical outcomes, economics and user/provider satisfaction. Telemedicine has multiple accepted benefits including time efficiency, patient/healthcare cost savings and community access, but with reported limitations of clinical uncertainty, technology infrastructure requirements, cybersecurity vulnerabilities and healthcare regulatory restraints. These limitations are being overcome by accelerated implementation during COVID-19 via fast-tracked practice development. Further work is required via development of research protocols to refine the application of emerging telemedicine technologies and their applicability to different surgical sub-specialties. © 2021",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105701111

Because of the unique functional requirement of omni-inclusiveness, HEs are expected to monitor patients, allowing for connectivity with vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In the absence of literature on security provisioning frameworks that connect VANETs and HEs, this paper presents a smart zero-knowledge proof and statistical fingerprinting-based trusted secure communication framework for a fog computing environment. A zero-knowledge proof is used for vehicle authentication, and statistical fingerprinting is employed to secure communication between VANETs and HEs. Authenticity verification of the operations is performed at the on-board unit (OBU) fitted in the vehicle based on the service executions at the resident hardware platform. The processor clock cycles are acquired from the service executions in a complete sandboxed environment. The calculated cycles assist in developing the blueprint signature for the particular OBU of the vehicle. Hence, the fingerprint signature helps build trust and plays a key role in authenticating the vehicle's horizontal movement to everything or to different sections of the HEs. In an environment enabled for fog computing, our novel model can provide efficient remote monitoring. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103271199

By the joint effort of the employees and the security analysts during the last two years, a large dataset of potentially malicious spam emails has been collected with each email being labeled as critical or irrelevant spam. By analyzing the main distinguishing characteristics of dangerous emails, a set of both traditional and novel features was identified and then tested and optimized by applying common supervised machine learning classifiers. The obtained massive experimental results show that Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifiers achieve the best performance, with the optimized feature set of only 36 features achieving 91.6% Recall and 95.2% Precision.

The literature has witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis. However, the integration of cybersecurity or safety aspects, along with the RAM to develop RAMS analysis methods, tools, and models, is a significant aspect for protecting CIs as their digitalization is progressing. In recent times, digital components and systems comprising information and communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a considerable cost, such as the necessity to integrate innovative cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities, efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development, resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focused on addressing integrated protection aspects, recent developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs. Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing studies dealing with developing techniques, methodologies, protocols, models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between 2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212 records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally, after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19 articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a comparative analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies, performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenarios, targeted applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is an emerging research area, with currently focused applications including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing, maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8% of the studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis. Also, 84.2% of the included studies focus on integrating only three aspects of CIs protection.

Given these conditions, the timing of this agreement was surprising. In this article I argue that state representatives engaged in a rule-governed social practice of applying old rules to new cases, and that the procedural rules governing this practice help to explain the existence, timing, and form of the agreement. They also help to explain further agreements expressed in a follow-on report issued in 2015. The findings of the case study presented here demonstrate that social practices of rule-making are simultaneously rule-governed and politically contested, and that outcomes of these processes have been shaped by specialized rules for making, interpreting, and applying rules. The effectiveness of procedural rules in shaping the outcome of a contentious, complex global security issue suggests that such rules are likely to matter even more in simpler cases dealing with less contentious issues. © 2020 The Author(s) (2020).

This cybernetic–mechatronic augmentation expanded the attack vectors in critical infrastructure's network, which gained the attraction of both cyber-offenders and cybersecurity researchers. Though the recent research works focus on developing proficient cybersecurity mechanisms, they often fail to address the major challenges such as handling the unseen zero-day exploits and detecting data irregularities that result in a poor attack detection rate. Hence to address the aforementioned challenges, this research article proposes an intelligent multi-level intrusion detection system to detect data-abnormalities in process-control network packets. The proposed approach involves the following phases: (i) Bloom-filter based payload level detection, (ii) partition-based Kohonen mapping for learning abnormal data patterns using a deep version of Kohonen neural network enhanced by principal component analysis and partitioning property of Hypergraph, and (iii) BLOSOM – a hybrid anomaly detection model. The impact of the proposed approach has been validated with the high-dimensional and heterogeneous benchmark datasets obtained from Mississippi State University (Gas-pipeline dataset) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (Secure WAter Treatment dataset).

Our data analysis applied a grounded approach which was then refined using an emotion theoretic lens with the application of Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT). Drawing on structural appraisal theory, our findings indicate the IT security team in the case study oscillated between positive problem-focused coping and negative emotion-focused coping. A key explanatory feature or turnaround mechanism that mediated this oscillation was senior management empathy and resource mobilization. Building on the analyses, a conceptual model is developed called the Transformation of Coping through Empathic Leadership (T-CEL).

Because of their sheer volume, and because phishing emails are designed to deceive, purely technological solutions can only go so far, leaving human judgment as the last line of defense. However, because it is difficult to phish people in the lab, little is known about the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying phishing susceptibility. There is therefore a critical need to develop an ecologically valid lab-based measure of phishing susceptibility that will allow evaluation of the cognitive mechanisms involved in phishing detection. Here we present such a measure based on a task, the Phishing Email Suspicion Test (PEST), and a cognitive model to quantify behavior. In PEST, participants rate a series of phishing and non-phishing emails according to their level of suspicion. By comparing suspicion scores for each email to its real-world efficacy, we find initial support for the ecological validity of PEST – phishing emails that were more effective in the real world were more effective at deceiving people in the lab. In the proposed computational model, we quantify behavior in terms of participants’ overall level of suspicion of emails, their ability to distinguish phishing from non-phishing emails, and the extent to which emails from the recent past bias their current decision. Together, our task and model provide a framework for studying the cognitive neuroscience of phishing detection. © 2020, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092931122

Cybersecurity represents one of the most serious threats to society, and it costs millions of dollars each year. The most significant question remains: Where do these attacks come from? The answer is that botnets provide platforms for cyberattacks. For many organizations, a botnet-assisted attack is a terrifying threat that can cause financial losses and leave global victims in its wake. It is therefore imperative to defend organizations against botnet-assisted attacks. Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for this because it allows exponential increases in the complexity of network management and configuration. SDN has a substantial advantage over traditional approaches with regard to network management because it separates the control plane from network equipment. However, security challenges continue to arise, which raises the need for different types of implementation strategies to spread attack vectors, despite the significant benefits. The main objective of this survey is to assess botnet detection techniques by using systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We evaluated various articles published since 2006 in the field of botnet detection, based on machine learning, and from 2015 in the field of SDN. Specifically, we used top-rated journals that featured the highest impact factors. In this paper, we aim to elaborate on several research areas regarding botnet attacks, detection techniques, machine learning, and SDN. We also address current research challenges and propose directions for future research. © 2021 by the authors.

In this context, this work investigates the feasibility of an attacker using a radar system or AIS as open door to remotely send commands to a cyber threat hosted on a ship, even if the ship’s systems are air gapped—i.e., are not connected to other networks. The received commands are intended to trigger a cyber threat located in the ship. Although the literature covers several analyzes on cyber risks and vulnerabilities in naval systems, it lacks exploiting mechanisms capable of acknowledging attack commands received through radar and AIS. To this end, this work proposes a triggering mechanism that uses a template matching technique to detect specific patterns transmitted by the attacker to the ship’s radar or AIS. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique as a tool to acknowledge the received attack commands and activate a malicious code previously installed on the ship. In the case of attacks on a radar system, the accuracy achieved by the proposed method is 0.90. In the case of attacks on an AIS/ECDIS setup it presents an accuracy of 0.93.

In an integrated system, where critical operating information and control signals of both systems need to be communicated, the risk of cyber attack is intensified. In this article, we present a new model for the integration of power and gas systems using power-to-gas (PtG) and gas-fired generation (GfG) facilities. We demonstrate how the operation of the integrated system can be adversely impacted during cyber attacks that may not be detected using traditional methods. We propose two new detection schemes for false data injection attacks against the input and output signals of the PtG/GfG facility scheduler. In the first scheme, a supervised machine-learning technique, based on the convolutional neural network and wavelet transforms, is adopted to detect attacks on the information received by the facility scheduler. In the second scheme, a hybrid neural network is developed, based on an unsupervised learning technique, that requires no labeled training information to detect attacks on the output control signals issued by the scheduler. In both schemes, information acquired from local sensors and deterministic estimation methods is utilized for signal evaluation. The proposed schemes are incorporated into the facilities' scheduler to create a cyber-attack resilient scheduling model in an integrated power and gas grid. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are evaluated via numerical studies using the IEEE30-bus power system integrated with the Belgian gas grid as the test bed using historical operating parameters. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101955274

Each of these busy learners have their own training needs and prior knowledge. Adopting the one-size-fits-all teaching approach is definitely not effective, motivating and encouraging. For some learners, the content might be too easy and for others, it might be too difficult. This is why this research presents the use of SMART Learning Environment that makes use of Intelligent Techniques to personalise the learning materials for each learner. This mismatch in skills is becoming a pressing issue and is having a direct impact on the ICT Sector, which is one of the pillars of the Mauritian Economy. This research, therefore, besides proposing a novel approach to learning, also attempts to address an issue of national importance. Data was collected during three phases, namely an Expert Reference Group Discussion, a pre-test questionnaire and a survey questionnaire. The Expert Reference Group Discussion was carried out to further understand the training needs and expectations of Cybersecurity professionals in Mauritius. A SMART Learning Environment making use of Artificial Neural Networks and Backpropagation Algorithm to personalise learning materials was eventually designed and implemented. The major findings of this research were that personalisation of learning materials through the use of a SMART Learning Environment can be used to address the training needs of Cybersecurity professionals in Mauritius. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099181801

According to recent security reports, malicious software (a.k.a. malware) is rising at an alarming rate in numbers as well as harmful purposes to compromise security of computing systems. To address the high complexity and computational overheads of conventional software-based detection techniques, Hardware-Supported Malware Detection (HMD) has proved to be efficient for detecting malware at the processors' microarchitecture level with the aid of Machine Learning (ML) techniques applied on Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) data. Existing ML-based HMDs while accurate in recognizing known signatures of malicious patterns, have not explored detecting unknown (zero-day) malware data at run-time which is a more challenging problem, since its HPC data does not match any known attack applications' signatures in the existing database. In this work, we first present a review of recent ML-based HMDs utilizing built-in HPC registers information. Next, we examine the suitability of various standard ML classifiers for zero-day malware detection and demonstrate that such methods are not capable of detecting unknown malware signatures with high detection rate. Lastly, to address the challenge of run-time zero-day malware detection, we propose an ensemble learning-based technique to enhance the performance of the standard malware detectors despite using a small number of microarchitectural features that are captured at run-time by existing HPCs. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach by applying AdaBoost ensemble learning on Random Forrest classifier as a regular classifier achieves 92% F-measure and 95% TPR with only 2% false positive rate in detecting zero-day malware using only the top 4 microarchitectural features. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106046991

However, many of these systems are developed with “black box” AI, which makes it difficult to explain how they work. For this reason, explainability and interpretability are key factors that need to be taken into consideration in the development of AI systems in critical areas. In addition, different contexts produce different explainability needs which must be met. Against this background, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) appears to be able to address and solve this situation. In the field of automated driving, XAI is particularly needed because the level of automation is constantly increasing according to the development of AI techniques. For this reason, the field of XAI in the context of automated driving is of particular interest. In this paper, we propose the use of an explainable intelligence technique in the understanding of some of the tasks involved in the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Since ADAS assist drivers in driving functions, it is essential to know the reason for the decisions taken. In addition, trusted AI is the cornerstone of the confidence needed in this research area. Thus, due to the complexity and the different variables that are part of the decision-making process, this paper focuses on two specific tasks in this area: the detection of emotions and the distractions of drivers. The results obtained are promising and show the capacity of the explainable artificial techniques in the different tasks of the proposed environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Namely, a variable threshold which indicates an attack on an observed and protected network is determined by using all three values obtained with three known IDS algorithms i.e., on previously recorded data by making a decision by majority. For these algorithms authors used algorithm of k-nearest neighbors, cumulative sum algorithm, and algorithm of exponentially weighted moving average. Using a proposed method we can get a threshold that is more precisely determined than in the case of any method individual. Practically, using TMR we obtain a dynamically threshold adjustment of IDS software, which reduces the existence of false alarms and undetected attacks, so the efficiency of such IDS software is notably higher and can get better results. Today, Denial of Service attacks (DoS) are one of the most present type of attacks and the reason for the special attention paid to them in this paper. In addition, the authors of the proposed method for IDS software used a known CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which contains various data recordings of such attacks. Obtained results with the proposed solution showed better characteristics than each individual used algorithm in this solution. IDS software with the proposed method worked precisely and timely, which means alarms were triggered properly and efficiently. © 2021 by the authors.

They come with various potential cyberattacks, which may cause power supply interruption or even human casualties. Therefore, decision-making for timely mitigation of cyberattack risks is highly desirable in the security protection of power systems. However, there is a lack of effective decentralized decision-making strategies that are able to deal with MMG scenarios through distributed consensus. To address this issue, a decentralized consensus decision-making (DCDM) approach is proposed in this article for the security of MMG systems. It achieves decentralized consensus without the need of a trusted authority or central server, making it distinct from existing consensus methods. Meanwhile, it guarantees the consistency and nonrepudiability of consensus results, which are stored on the blockchain in sequence. In each of the distributed agents, the approach consists of a fuzzy static Bayesian game model (FSB-GM) to determine the optimal security strategy and a hybrid consensus algorithm to achieve consensus. The FSB-GM considers the fuzzy preferences of different types of attackers and defenders. The hybrid consensus algorithm is implemented by the fusion improvement of two consensus mechanisms in the blockchain. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through a case study on an MMG system. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103226144

The aim of this article was to describe the experience designing and organizing a web congress by the 2020 IWBNC method. Methods: The 2020 IWBNC was organized by the Center for Research and Training in Neurosurgery (Centro de Investigación y Entrenamiento en Neurocirugía [CIEN]) in a record time of 4 weeks. Eight committees were created and assigned a specific task. The event followed a strict protocol based on the double-room method, which consisted of 2 virtual rooms (A and B) hosted from 4 different physical locations to avoid lecture overlapping and connection drops. Quality and impact were measured by a videoconferencing platform and social media parameters as well as an audience perception survey. Results: High quality was achieved in academic standards, worldwide assistance, schedule adherence, and security.

We find that local governments are affected by cyber incidents more frequently, and disruption incidents that lead to the malfunction of e-government services are on the rise. In addition, the magnitude of cyber losses used to have a strong positive relationship with the affected governments' budget size. However, in recent years, this relationship is weakening, and small local governments are more heavily impacted by cyber incidents than before. Our findings further suggest that investing in information technology is becoming more effective in terms of lowering the loss-to-budget ratio.

The attackers inserted malware into that source code so that, when the software was distributed to and deployed by SolarWinds customers as part of an update, the malicious software could be used to surveil customers who unknowingly installed the malware and gain potentially arbitrary control over the systems managed by Orion. One of the solutions is to improve government software procurement. Software is critical to national security. Any system of procuring that software needs to evaluate the security of the software and the security practices of the company, in detail, to ensure that they are sufficient to meet the security needs of the network they are being installed in.

To be specific, when the change occurs, a time-varying unknown vector is added in the linear regression model. The parameter vector of the linear regression model is also assumed to be unknown and time-varying. Thus, the pre- and post-change distributions are both unknown and time-varying. This imposes a significant challenge for designing a computationally efficient sequential detector. We first propose two Cumulative-Sum-type algorithms to address this challenge. One is called generalized Cumulative-Sum (GCUSUM) algorithm, and the other one is called relaxed generalized Cumulative-Sum (RGCUSUM) algorithm, which is a modified version of the GCUSUM. It can be shown that the computational complexity of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm scales linearly with the number of observations. Next, considering Lordon's setup, for any given constraint on the expected false alarm period, a lower bound on the threshold employed in the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm is derived, which provides a useful guideline for the design of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm to achieve any prescribed performance requirement in practice. In addition, for any given threshold employed in the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm, an upper bound on the expected detection delay is also provided. The performance of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm is numerically studied in the context of an IEEE standard power system under FDIAs. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RGCUSUM in computational efficiency. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099248524

Thus, the promotion of cybersecurity behaviors can effectively protect individuals from these threats. However, cybersecurity behaviors do not necessarily come naturally, and people need support and encouragement to develop and adopt them. A habit is an important factor that may motivate cybersecurity behaviors, but it has often been overlooked in past studies. To address this limitation, this study examined the formation of cybersecurity behavioral habits. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze cybersecurity behavior survey data obtained from 393 college student participants. The results revealed the following: (1) efficacy and behavioral comprehensiveness predict cybersecurity behavioral habits; (2) efficacy has a positively impact on behavioral comprehensiveness; (3) situational support has a positive influence on efficacy. These findings suggest that cybersecurity behavioral habits can be formed by promoting the diversity of cybersecurity measures practiced (behavioral comprehensiveness) and efficacy. © 2020",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098987743

In response to this pandemic, governments in different countries have implemented social distancing measures to stop the spread of the virus. The closure of schools and switch to remote learning of universities to protect youth and children from exposure to the virus might also open opportunities for certain crimes such as cyberbullying. The study aimed at exploring the risks of victimization of children and youth through cyberbullying during the lockdown. A qualitative approach, non-participant observation was utilised. Data was collected from three social media platforms which include Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram from posts since the beginning of lockdown. Keywords such as “ama2000s”, “2000s” and “90s vs 2000s” were used to search for content. Facebook groups for “2000s” where most young people engage were also used. The study found that with the increase of the use of social media among children and youth during the lockdown, most have been victims of cyberbullying. In these platforms where young people engage, most posts and comments carried content which includes sexting, sexual comments on young girls’ pictures, trending of videos of school children fighting, and insulting each other. A significant finding was the use of fake accounts to perpetrate cyberbullying. The study recommends that addressing cyberbullying through educating children and youth about acceptable online behaviour, signs of cyberbullying, responses to it, and cybersecurity should be prioritised. © 2021 Lifescience Global.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101869402

They tend to use standard security to implement CAPTCHAs in order to prevent hackers from writing malicious automated programs to make false website registrations and to restrict them from stealing end‐users’ private information. Among the categories of CAPTCHAs, the text‐based CAPTCHA is the most widely used. However, with the evolution of deep learning, it has been so dramatic that tasks previously thought not easily addressable by computers and used as CAPTCHA to prevent spam are now possible to break. The workflow of CAPTCHA breaking is a combination of efforts, approaches, and the development of the computation‐efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that attempts to increase accuracy. In this study, in contrast to breaking the whole CAPTCHA images simultaneously, this study split four‐character CAPTCHA images for the individual characters with a 2‐pixel margin around the edges of a new training dataset, and then proposed an efficient and accurate Depth‐wise Separable Convolutional Neural Network for breaking text‐based CAP‐ TCHAs. Most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first CAPTCHA breaking study to use the Depth‐wise Separable Convolution layer to build an efficient CNN model to break text-based CAPTCHAs. We have evaluated and compared the performance of our proposed model to that of fine‐tuning other popular CNN image recognition architectures on the generated CAPTCHA image dataset. In real‐time, our proposed model used less time to break the text‐based CAPTCHAs with an accuracy of more than 99% on the testing dataset. We observed that our proposed CNN model has efficiently improved the CAPTCHA breaking accuracy and streamlined the structure of the CAPTCHA breaking network as compared to other CAPTCHA breaking techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

The initial corpus of malicious samples consists of network flows belonging to different botnet families presented in three public datasets containing real enterprise network traffic. We use these datasets to devise detectors capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance. We then train two DRL agents, based on Double Deep Q-Network and Deep Sarsa, to generate realistic adversarial samples: the goal is achieving misclassifications by performing small modifications to the initial malicious samples. These alterations involve the features that can be more realistically altered by an expert attacker, and do not compromise the underlying malicious logic of the original samples.

A six-step DL driven methodology is provided to summarize and analyze the surveyed literature for applying DL methods to detect cyber attacks against CPS systems. The methodology includes CPS scenario analysis, cyber attack identification, ML problem formulation, DL model customization, data acquisition for training, and performance evaluation. The reviewed works indicate great potential to detect cyber attacks against CPS through DL modules. Moreover, excellent performance is achieved partly because of several high-quality datasets that are readily available for public use. Furthermore, challenges, opportunities, and research trends are pointed out for future research. IEEE",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115176484

The reason for this is the high computation speed and the huge storage capacity that cloud owners provide at low prices. However, despite the attractiveness of the cloud computing environment to database users, privacy issues remain a cause for concern for database owners since data access is out of their control. Encryption is the only way of assuaging users' fears surrounding data privacy, but executing Structured Query Language (SQL) queries over encrypted data is a challenging task, especially if the data are encrypted by a randomized encryption algorithm. Many researchers have addressed the privacy issues by encrypting the data using deterministic, onion layer, or homomorphic encryption. Nevertheless, even with these systems, the encrypted data can still be subjected to attack. In this research, we first propose an indexing scheme to encode the original table's tuples into bit vectors (BVs) prior to the encryption. The resulting index is then used to narrow the range of retrieved encrypted records from the cloud to a small set of records that are candidates for the user's query. Based on the indexing scheme, we then design a system to execute SQL queries over the encrypted data. The data are encrypted by a single randomized encryption algorithm, namely the Advanced Encryption Standard-Cipher-Block Chaining (AES-CBC). In the proposed scheme, we store the index values (BVs) at user's side, and we extend the system to support most of relational algebra operators, such as select, join, etc. Implementation and evaluation of the proposed system reveals that it is practical and efficient at reducing both the computation and space overhead when compared with state-of-the-art systems like CryptDB. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113193828

The industry 4.0 paradigm encourages the usage of smart sensors, devices, and machines, to enable smart factories that continuously collect data pertaining to production. ML techniques enable the generation of actionable intelligence by processing the collected data to increase manufacturing efficiency without significantly changing the required resources. Additionally, the ability of ML techniques to provide predictive insights has enabled discerning complex manufacturing patterns and offers a pathway for an intelligent decision support system in a variety of manufacturing tasks such as intelligent and continuous inspection, predictive maintenance, quality improvement, process optimisation, supply chain management, and task scheduling. While different ML techniques have been used in a variety of manufacturing applications in the past, many open questions and challenges remain, from Big data curation, storage, and understanding, data reasoning to enable real-time actionable intelligence to topics such as edge computing and cybersecurity aspects of smart manufacturing.

It preemptively gets rid of digital dangers and supports security foundation utilizing different methods. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, utilizes formulas constructed from historical databases and observable analysis to create presumptions regarding the actions of a machine. The machine would then be able to alter its activities—and even perform capacities for which it hasn’t been unequivocally modified. With its capacity to figure out a huge number of records and distinguish conceivably risky ones, machine learning is progressively being utilized to reveal dangers and naturally squash them before they can unleash ruin. Looking at the numerous benefits, this chapter tries to explore the various forms of cyberattacks and the application of Machine Learning in handling these attacks and thereby increasing cyber security.

A typical industry network consists of sensors, actuators, devices, and services to connect, track, and manage production processes to increase performance and boost productivity. The SEMI Equipment Communications Standard/Generic Equipment Model (SECS/GEM) is SEMI’s Machine-to-Machine (M2M) protocol for equipment-to-host data communications. It is the most popular and profoundly used M2M communication protocol operating in the manufacturing industry. With Industry 4.0 as a guiding factor, connectivity to business networks is required for accessing real-time data whenever and wherever needed. This openness of connectivity raises security concerns as SECS/GEM protocol offers no security, which endangers exposing the manufacturing industries’ business secrets and production processes. This paper discusses the key processes involved in SECS/GEM communications and how potential attackers can manipulate these processes to obtain illegal or unauthorized access. The experiments’ results indicate that the SECS/GEM processes are entirely vulnerable to numerous attacks, including DoS attack, Replay attack, and False-Data-Injection-Attack. Thus, the future direction involves developing a prevention mechanism that aims at securing the SECS/GEM processes in the industrial network. This study’s findings are useful as preliminary guidance for the infrastructure owners to plan for appropriate security measures to protect the industrial network. © 2021.

The average revenue of participating organizations was $5.4 billion (median $420 million). IT spending, as a percentage of revenue, was 6.9%, the highest figure in ten years and 27% higher than in 2019. Average IT spending in 2020 was $372.6 million. The percentage of organizations decreasing IT spending more than doubled. Most reported increases in both head count and employee salaries, which were, however, less than in recent years. These and many other findings were likely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The top five IT management issues in 2020 were Cybersecurity, Alignment of IT with the Business, Data Analytics, Digital Transformation, and Compliance &amp; Regulations, unchanged from 2019. The top five largest IT investments were also largely unchanged: Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, Cybersecurity, Application Development and CRM. Use of cloud services continued to increase, almost doubling in the last five years, and cybersecurity continues to be a concern. The most common criteria for assessing CIO performance were User Satis -faction (Internal), Value of IT to the Business, Contribution of IT to Strategy, IT Cost Control and Cybersecurity. The average tenure of CIOs remains a little over six years, with almost 47% reporting to the CEO and over 26% to the CFO, the former down and the latter up since 2019. Continuing trends are for CIOs to come from outside the organization (now over 80%) and from non-IT positions (now nearly a quarter). suc-cessfully.1 © 2021.

Therefore, the necessity of intelligent systems or techniques can prevent and protect the data over the network. Cyberattack is the most prominent problem of cybersecurity and now a challenging area of research for scientists and researchers. These attacks may destroy data, system, and resources and sometimes may damage the whole network. Previously numerous traditional techniques were used for the detection and mitigation of cyberattack, but the techniques are not efficient for new attacks. Today's machine learning and metaheuristic techniques are popularly applied in different areas to achieve efficient computation and fast processing of complex data of the network. This paper is discussing the improvements and enhancement of security models, frameworks for the detection of cyberattacks, and prevention by using different machine learning and optimization techniques in the domain of cybersecurity. This paper is focused on the literature of different metaheuristic algorithms for optimal feature selection and machine learning techniques for the classification of attacks, and some of the prominent algorithms such as GA, evolutionary, PSO, machine learning, and others are discussed in detail. This study provides descriptions and tutorials that can be referred from various literature citations, references, or latest research papers. The techniques discussed are efficiently applied with high performance for detection, mitigation, and identification of cyberattacks and provide a security mechanism over the network.

Such technologies of using IoT and remote patient monitoring systems have become dramatically fundamental to reduce the movement of patients, and hence reducing the risk of spreading Covid-19 infection. The Ministry of Health in the Kingdom of Bahrain strives to achieve digital transformation in the healthcare industry, where the National Health Information System (I-SEHA) was launched to provide higher-quality health services. The system interconnects the public healthcare institutes, allowing access to patient’s data from any location without the hassle of moving the files physically. Digitization of medical data of patients and sharing some of the data with other institutions outside the protected networks may lead to major privacy and integrity concerns. This paper introduces Blockchain-based Zero-Knowledge Proof (BZKP) model, which is an IoT-based patient-centric model that fuses a zero-knowledge proof solution to be developed for protecting patient’s privacy, and ensures patients prior consent on any access to their data including their health status and account balance. The proposed model is developed to provide a robust and scalable architecture for data sharing, which protects the privacy of sensitive data while maintaining high availability. It also provides strong trust and integrity of data by using the immutability features of the blockchain. BZKP is based on pre-approved blockchain access tokens to address challenges of accountability and privacy in Bahrain smart cities. As a result, the model provides a secure and trusted access model between different stakeholders to share patient data while maintaining privacy, trust, and high availability. The zero-knowledge proof can be used with the smart contracts, which provides programmable actions that can be used for automating the prescriptions dispensation process for private pharmacies in a decentralized manner with high confidence. Finally, it recommends enhanced electronic key (eKey) procedures used by eGovernment of the Kingdom of Bahrain to update the smart card which stores the personal keys for protecting patient’s privacy and provide better consent. © 2021 The Author(s).

Encryption techniques may be utilized to achieve data robustness and security in digital multimedia communication systems. From this perspective, this paper presents an optical ciphering framework using Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE) for efficient and secure transmission of Three-Dimensional Videos (3DVs). Firstly, in the DRPE-based 3DV cybersecurity framework proposed in the paper, an optical emitter converts each frame of the transmitted 3DV into an optical signal. Then, the DRPE technique encrypts the obtained optical signal using two kinds of phase modulation in the time and frequency domains. Lastly, a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) digital camera converts, upon detection, the optical cipher frames to digital format. The proposed DRPE-based 3DV cybersecurity framework is examined and investi-gated through visual inspection and various security statistical metrics. Experi-ments and analysis show that the proposed DRPE-based 3DV cybersecurity framework is secure and effective to mitigate different multimedia attacks. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

In this paper, a stochastic programming formulation is presented for optimisation of cybersecurity investment and selection of security controls to mitigate and balance the impact of direct and indirect (propagated) cyber risks in a multi-tier supply chain. Using a network transformation combined with the first-order Taylor series approximation of natural logarithm to linearise the nonlinear constraints, a nonlinear stochastic combinatorial optimisation model is approximated by its linear equivalent. The problem objective is to determine an optimal cybersecurity investment under limited budget and portfolio of security controls for each supply chain node to balance the cybersecurity over the entire supply chain. The minmax objective functions are applied to minimise either the maximum breach probability or the maximum loss of supply chain nodes. Alternatively, maxmin objectives are used to maximise either the minimum non-breach probability or the minimum saving of loss. The proposed integrated modelling approach is illustrated with results of computational study and a comparison of approximated and exact solution values is presented.

Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) is widely believed to be an ideal infrastructure for connecting IoV. In this paper, we present an approach for understanding the security issues of complex IoT systems and propose a security reference architecture for assessing security risks and addressing the security requirements. Specifically, we propose an Activity-Network-Things (ANT)-centric security reference architecture which is based on the three architectural perspectives in studying IoT systems namely device, internet and semantic. We discuss the limitations of existing IoT system architecture models, which are mainly evolved from enterprise system architecture with some adaptation to the inherent features of IoT systems. Our approach can help manage the security risks by focusing on the critical activities performed in different micro-perimeters within an IoT system. The proposed architecture includes an organized process to understand the security requirements and select specific parameters for tailored security controls that are commensurate with organization-specific and application-specific security impacts of IoT.

Wide-spread use of information technology in smartgrid domain is an outcome of this need. IEC 61850-based communication solutions have become popular due to a myriad of reasons. Object-oriented modeling capability, interoperable connectivity and strong communication protocols are to name a few. However, power system communication infrastructure is not well-equipped with cybersecurity mechanisms for safe operation. Unlike online banking systems that have been running such security systems for decades, smartgrid cybersecurity is an emerging field. A recent publication aimed at equipping IEC 61850-based communication with cybersecurity features, i.e. IEC 62351, only focuses on communication layer security. To achieve security at all levels, operational technology-based security is also needed. To address this need, this paper develops an intrusion detection system for smartgrids utilizing IEC 61850's Sampled Value (SV) messages. The system is developed with machine learning and is able to monitor communication traffic of a given power system and distinguish normal data measurements from falsely injected data, i.e. attacks. The designed system is implemented and tested with realistic IEC 61850 SV message dataset. Tests are performed on a Modified IEEE 14-bus system with renewable energy-based generators where different fault are applied. The results show that the proposed system can successfully distinguish normal power system events from cyberattacks with high accuracy. This ensures that smartgrids have intrusion detection in addition to cybersecurity features attached to exchanged messages. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103893778

Based on representative survey data collected from 967 respondents, we found that people who feel well-informed about online safety feel less vulnerable to cybercrime and are less inclined to take security measures. At the same time, feeling informed is associated with being more convinced of the severity of cybercrime. High levels of trust in the safety of the internet are linked to the feeling that one is less vulnerable to cybercrime and the perception that cybercrime is not a severe threat.

By using a combination of cybersecurity-related visualisations, our goals are: i) to raise awareness about cybersecurity, and ii) to improve communication among IT personnel, security experts, and non-technical personnel. To achieve these goals, we combine two modelling languages: Customer Journey Modelling Language (CJML) is a visual language for modelling and visualisation of work processes in terms of user journeys.

Traditional risk assessment and underwriting practices face serious shortcomings when encountered with cyber threats. Conventional assessment frameworks rate risk based on historical frequency and severity of losses incurred, this method is effective for known risks; however, due to the absence of historical data, prove ineffective for assessing cyber risk. This paper proposes a conceptual cyber risk classification and assessment framework, designed to demonstrate the significance of proactive and reactive barriers in reducing companies’ exposure to cyber risk and quantify the risk. This method combines a bow-tie model with a risk matrix to produce a rating based on the likelihood of a cyber-threat occurring and the potential severity of the resulting consequences. The model can accommodate both historical data and expert opinion and previously known frameworks to score the Threats, Barriers and Escalators for the framework. The resultant framework is applied to a large city hospital in Europe. The results highlighted both cyber weaknesses and actions that should be taken to bolster cyber defences. The results provide a quick visual guide that is assessable to both experts and management.

As a result, once an attacker has gained access, they have full control of the entire production plant because of the lack of network segmentation. With the goal of raising cybersecurity awareness, in this paper we describe a practical case study showing attack scenarios that we have validated on a real modular smart manufacturing system, and suggest practical security counter measures. The testbed smart manufacturing system is part of the Industry 4.0 research laboratory hosted by Politecnico di Milano, and comprises seven assembly stations, each with their programmable logic controllers and human-computer interfaces, as well as an industrial robotic arm that performs pick-and-place tasks. On this testbed we show two indirect attacks to gain initial access, even under the best-case scenario of a system not directly connected to any public network. We conclude by showing two post-exploitation scenarios that an adversary can use to cause physical impact on the production, or keep persistent access to the plant. We are unaware of a similar security analysis performed within the premises of a research facility, following a scientific methodology, so we believe that this work can represent a good first step to inspire follow up research on the many verticals that we touch. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Consider the case where a cybersecurity breach is suspected following the discovery of one attack action, for example by observing the modification of sensitive registry keys, suspicious network traffic patterns, or the abuse of legitimate credentials. At this point, the investigator can have multiple options as to what to check next to discover the rest, and will likely pick one based on experience and training. This will be the case at each new step. We argue that the efficiency of this aspect of the job, which is the selection of what next step to take, can have significant impact on its overall cost (e.g., the duration) of the investigation and can be improved through the application of constrained optimization techniques. Here, we present DISCLOSE, the first data-driven decision support framework for optimizing forensic investigations of cybersecurity breaches. DISCLOSE benefits from a repository of known adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), for each of which it harvests threat intelligence information to calculate its probabilistic relations with the rest. These relations, as well as a proximity parameter derived from the projection of quantitative data regarding the adversarial TTPs on an attack life cycle model, are both used as input to our optimization framework. We show the feasibility of this approach in a case study that consists of 31 adversarial TTPs, data collected from 6 interviews with experienced cybersecurity professionals and data extracted from the MITRE ATTCK STIX repository and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100475334

In this article, we initiate the study of modeling and predicting risk in enterprise-level data breaches. This problem is challenging because of the sparsity of breaches experienced by individual enterprises over time, which immediately disqualifies standard statistical models because there are not enough data to train such models. As a first step towards tackling the problem, we propose an innovative statistical framework to leverage the dependence between multiple time series.

Additionally, every year, data is stolen and modified from the internet when transmitting. Therefore, to improve security while transmission, there are two techniques available called cryptography and steganography. In cryptography, the information is encrypted to ciphertexts using a private key, but the message’s existence is visible to others, no matter how unbreakable they are. On the other hand, steganography hides the secret data in an ordinary non-secret file to avoid visual detection. This paper proposed a new data hiding method using LSB image steganography, where confidential information uses only the selected image pixel. For that, image pixel information is used to filter the complete image to decide the candidate pixel, and a user-defined password is used to secure the LSB steganography. For better security, before applying steganography, the AES method encrypts the secret message. In the experiment, MSE and PSNR value are measured to assess the quality of the resultant stego image. The stego image provides higher PSNR and less MSE value as compared to other studied methods, which illustrate the flexibility of the proposed method. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096875530

The increasing complexity of both Internet services and traffic determines a scenario that in many cases impedes the proper deployment of intrusion detection and prevention systems. Although it is a common practice to monitor network and applications activity, there is not a general methodology to codify and interpret the recorded events. Moreover, this lack of methodology somehow erodes the possibility of diagnosing whether event detection and recording is adequately performed. As a result, there is an urge to construct general codification and classification procedures to be applied on any type of security event in any activity log. This work is focused on defining such a method using the so-called normalized compression distance (NCD). NCD is parameter-free and can be applied to determine the distance between events expressed using strings. As a first step in the concretion of a methodology for the integral interpretation of security events, this work is devoted to the characterization of web logs. On the grounds of the NCD, we propose an anomaly-based procedure for identifying web attacks from web logs. Given a web query as stored in a security log, a NCD-based feature vector is created and classified using a support vector machine. The method is tested using the CSIC-2010 data set, and the results are analyzed with respect to similar proposals. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

In this context, organizations acknowledge the importance of strengthening their cybersecurity programs to protect critical business processes along with the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information and information systems through people, processes, and technology by preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber attackers resorting to sophisticated cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Meanwhile, national and international standardization bodies reacted through the development of various cybersecurity risk management frameworks and standards that can be leveraged by organizations while maturing their cybersecurity capabilities. In a nutshell, this paper aims to provide a critical evaluation of several widespread cybersecurity risk management frameworks adopted by organizations to alleviate cyber risks. The paper starts with an introduction about the key drivers for adopting a cybersecurity risk management framework within organizations. Further, the paper gives an overview of several well-renowned cybersecurity risk management frameworks and related standards, methods and methodologies.

Although cybersecurity has become a concern of national policymakers, insurers appear to have supplanted the state to play an influential role in governing some aspects of client behavior. This paper explores private governance by cyber insurance firms and evaluates two competing explanations for its emergence – either that the private sector advanced to set and enforce cybersecurity standards for financial gain, or that the state retreated from its responsibility to regulate and private sector actors filled the gap only as necessary. To find an answer between these explanations, this article develops a single outcome case study of the American cyber insurance industry. Following a theoretical introduction to private governance and its manifestation through insurance, the article examines the insurance process and its application in cybersecurity, the key role of standards, and the mechanism of enforcing those standards.

This study's motivation was to understand the current state of the art and identify gaps to suggest future directions regarding OT in construction from the cybersecurity perspective. To achieve that, a bibliometric analysis was conducted. The analysis utilized the Scopus database to retrieve related publications and VOSviewer version 1.6.15 software to visualize bibliometric networks. Main research themes were identified, and each theme was reviewed from a cybersecurity perspective. The limitations of the analysis include the lack of industry-based categorization, the domination of publications focusing on the cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs), and the set of keyword combinations used for the literature search that could be expanded to cover a broader range of research topics.

Hence, they integrate human, cyber, and physical elements. Since MCPSs are life-critical and context-aware, they are significant to the healthcare industry, which is prone to data breaches and cyber-attacks. As an emerging research area, MCPS faces several challenges with respect to system reliability, assurance, autonomy and security, and privacy. In this paper, we initially examine the state-of-the-arts of MCPS over the last few decades (1998–2020) and subsequently propose a new framework considering security/privacy for MPCS that incorporates several models that depict various domains of security. An interaction between various models followed with a qualitative assessment of the framework has been carried out to present a detailed description of the proposed framework. It is useful in various healthcare industries like health care services, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, etc. that utilize smart devices. Additionally, the framework may be applied to enhance security in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. It may be also useful to deploy efficient workflow operations for patients under the consideration framework. The framework will also lay out the foundation for implementing cybersecurity infrastructures in many healthcare applications. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103155502

Our investigation confirmed a number of aspects that we were indeed aware of, when it came to people’s lived cybersecurity experiences. We also identified one particular blind spot issue: widespread, but not universal, negativity towards cybersecurity. We then carried out an investigation using a recognized methodology from psychology, as a first attempt to assess the nature of this negativity and to get a sense of its roots. What our initial experiment revealed was that scoping cybersecurity-related emotions is nontrivial and will require the formulation of new measurement tools.

To overcome this problem, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has been introduced to facilitate the operation and production management process. However, the palm oil industry needs to address sustainability issues. Therefore, the circular economy (CE) is the best solution. By deploying I4.0 in the CE, the palm oil industry, a multimillion-dollar industry, is expected to improve its operations and production and achieve sustainability in the near future. However, to benefit from advanced I4.0 in the CE, it is important to assess the drivers that cause the evolution and dissemination of these technologies. By considering the importance of I4.0 in the CE, this study aims to investigate the drivers of I4.0 in the CE and the nexus between them from an ecological modernization theory perspective. This study uses a combined approach based on the Delphi technique, fuzzy decision-making trials and evaluation laboratory methods to analyse the driving forces of I4.0 in the CE. The results show 17 driving criteria in the cause group and 13 criteria in the effect group. In particular, information for practitioners, cybersecurity, improving real-time, economic attractiveness, laws and policy and energy recovery are the most powerful criteria that can influence the other criteria, especially the criteria in the effect group. Overall, this study contributes theoretical and practical insights, as well as policy implications. The study's findings will help firms clarify the connectivity between the significant drivers of I4.0 in the CE, especially in the palm oil industry, which is valuable in the development of congruent solutions for inducing sustainable development. Finally, this study suggests that a wide range of integration and connectivity effects on I4.0 in the CE allow for an improvement in the overall performance, including operations and production, by adopting a holistic approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116552070

Adversaries need, for example, to develop attack tools, select open services to abuse, test them, and adapt the attacks if necessary, each of which can be implemented in myriad ways. Thus, to understand the entire ecosystem and how adversaries work, we need to look at the entire chain of activities. This paper analyzes adversarial techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) based on 549 honeypots deployed in 5 clouds that were rallied to participate in 13,479 attacks. Using a traffic shaping approach to prevent meaningful participation in DDoS activities while allowing short bursts of adversarial testing, we find that adversaries actively test for plausibility, packet loss, and amplification benefits of these servers, and show evidence of a 'memory' of previously exploited servers among attackers.

Design/methodology/approach: Characteristics of cybersecurity footprint are presented based on documented cases, and the domino effect of cybersecurity is illustrated. Organizational and individual cybersecurity footprints are outlined. Active and passive – digital vs cybersecurity footprints are then reviewed. Taxonomy of aware/unaware vs active/passive cybersecurity footprints are presented, followed by brief discussion of the implications for future research. Findings: The concept of cybersecurity footprint is defined, and the evidence from prior cyber incidents is shown to emphasize the concept. Smaller organizations may have a large cybersecurity footprint, whereas larger organizations may have smaller one. Cyberattacks are focusing on the individuals or small organizations that are in the supply chain of larger organizations causing the domino effect. Practical implications: Implications of cybersecurity footprint to individuals, organizations, societies and governments are discussed. The authors present organizations with ways to lower cybersecurity footprint along with recommendations for future research. Social implications: Cybersecurity has a significant social implication worldwide, as the world is becoming cyber dependent. With the authors’ introduction of the cybersecurity footprint concept and call to further understand how organizations can measure and reduce it, the authors envision it as another perspective of assessing cyber risk and further help mitigate future cyber incidents.

The procedure shifted to the digitalized manner, but still, on a certain note, manual authentication is required. In the initial process, the university verified the degree and stamp seal first. Then, a physical channel of degree submission to the receiving ends is activated. After that, the degree is attested while properly examining and analyzing the tamper records related to degree credentials through e-communication with the university for verification and validation. This issue poses a serious challenge to educational information integrity and privacy. Potentially, blockchain technology could become a standardized platform to perform tasks including issuing, verifying, auditing, and tracing immutable records, which would enable the HEC, universities, and Federal Education Ministry (FEM) to quickly and easily get attested and investigate the forge proof versions of certificates. Besides, decentralized distributed data blocks in chronological order provide high security between distributed ledgers, consensus engine, digital signature, smart contracts, permissioned application, and private network node transactions that guarantee degree record validation and traceability. This paper presents an architecture (HEDU-Ledger) and detail design of blockchain-enabled hyperledger fabric applications implementation for degree attestation verification and traceable direct channel design between HEC and universities. The hyperledger fabric endorses attestation records first, and then validates (committer) the degree and maintains the secure chain of tracing between stakeholder peer nodes. Furthermore, this HEDU-Ledger architecture avoids language and administrative barriers. It also provides robustness in terms of security and privacy of records and maintains integrity with secure preservation as compared to that of the other state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study aims to explore the main security issues in smart living environments using data mining techniques. To this end, we applied a three-sentence data mining analysis of 9,38,258 tweets collected from Twitter under the user-generated data (UGD) framework. First, sentiment analysis was applied using Textblob which was tested with support vector classifier, multinomial naïve bayes, logistic regression, and random forest classifier; as a result, the analyzed tweets were divided into those expressing positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. Next, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied to divide the sample into topics related to security issues in smart living environments. Finally, the insights were extracted by applying a textual analysis process in Python validated with the analysis of frequency and weighted percentage variables and calculating the statistical measure known as mutual information (MI) to analyze the identified n-grams (unigrams and bigrams).

However, the change in work culture would also increase the chances of the cybersecurity attack, MAC spoofing attack, and DDoS/DoS attack due to the divergent incoming traffic from the untrusted network for accessing the enterprise’s resources. Networks are usually unable to detect spoofing if the intruder already forges the host’s MAC address. However, the techniques used in the existing researches﻿ mistakenly classify the malicious host as the legitimate one. This paper proposes a novel access control policy based on a zero-trust network by explicitly restricting the incoming network traffic to substantiate MAC spoofing attacks in the software-defined network (SDN) paradigm of cloud computing. The multiplicative increase and additive decrease algorithm helps to detect the advanced MAC spoofing attack before penetrating the SDN-based cloud resources. Based on the proposed approach, a dynamic threshold is assigned to the incoming port number. The self-learning feature of the threshold stamping helps to rectify a legitimate user’s traffic before classifying it to the attacker. Finally, the mathematical and experimental results exhibit high accuracy and detection rate than the existing methodologies.

With the increasing deployment of cyber-enabled technologies in power systems, modern power system is prevalently exposed to a wide gamut of cybersecurity threats. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective cyber risk management mechanisms to mitigate the growing cyberthreats. Recently cyber insurance is emerging as a promising financial instrument for cyber risk management of critical infrastructures such as power grids. In this paper, a new cyber-insurance design framework is proposed to hedge against the risk of massive monetary losses due to potential cyberthreats. Traditionally, insurance companies serve as third-party risk-bearers offering aggregate design of the insurance policy which may stipulate high premiums. However, unusual loss patterns may still lead to excess financial risk for insurance companies. In this paper, coalitional insurance is introduced as a promising alternative or supplement to the traditional insurance plans provided by insurance companies. Under the proposed cyber-insurance model, several transmission operators form an insurance coalition, where the coalitional premiums are derived considering system vulnerabilities and loss distributions. The indemnity which covers the loss of TOs complies with the budget sufficiency. Overall, this study proposes a novel coalitional platform based cyber-insurance design that estimates the insurance premiums via cybersecurity modeling and reliability implication analysis. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105859482

This study responds to this gap by investigating the influence of the major technologies: Additive Manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Vision, Big Data and Advanced Analytics, Cybersecurity, Internet of Things, Robotics, and Virtual and Augmented Reality on the main areas of action covered by the circular economy. Namely, reduction of inputs consumption, reuse, recovery, recycling and reduction of waste and emissions. An initial study, based on a survey of 120 project managers, and a multiple case study of 27 projects, through 31 personal interviews and review of internal and external documentation have been conducted in order to investigate the real influence of each technology on the circular economy. Overall, the results confirm the existence of a wide range of influences that Industry 4.0 technologies offer to companies for improved circularity. These improvements are mainly related to reduce material and energy consumption, and waste and emissions generation. However, there are important differences between the potential impacts of each technology. In particular, there is most evidence of the positive impact of additive manufacturing and robotics.

Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential. © 2021 ACM.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117923142

In this study, we comprehensively review the current applications of AI/ML-based models in these fields and the opportunities that arise from their application. Specifically, we refer to the applications of AI/ML-based models in prevention, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases, gastrointestinal premalignant and malignant lesions, other nonmalignant gastrointestinal lesions and diseases, hepatitis B and C infection, chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Nowadays there are many DNS firewall solutions. Most of these are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block known malicious communications, leaving out many others that can be malicious but are not known. Adopting machine learning to classify domains contributes to the detection of domains that are not yet on the block list. The dataset described in this manuscript is meant for supervised machine learning-based analysis of malicious and non-malicious domain names. The dataset was created from scratch, using publicly DNS logs of both malicious and non-malicious domain names. Using the domain name as input, 34 features were obtained. Features like the domain name entropy, number of strange characters and domain name length were obtained directly from the domain name. Other features like, domain name creation date, Internet Protocol (IP), open ports, geolocation were obtained from data enrichment processes (e.g. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)). The class was determined considering the data source (malicious DNS log files and non-malicious DNS log files).

Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently been argued to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial incentives and the associated technological infrastructure. In this paper, we study previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial attack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains: ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. We focus on adversarial black-box settings, in which the attacker does not have full access to the target model and usually uses another model, commonly referred to as surrogate model, to craft adversarial examples that are then transferred to the target model. We consider this to be the most realistic scenario for MedIA systems. Firstly, we study the effect of weight initialization (pre-training on ImageNet or random initialization) on the transferability of adversarial attacks from the surrogate model to the target model, i.e., how effective attacks crafted using the surrogate model are on the target model. Secondly, we study the influence of differences in development (training and validation) data between target and surrogate models. We further study the interaction of weight initialization and data differences with differences in model architecture. All experiments were done with a perturbation degree tuned to ensure maximal transferability at minimal visual perceptibility of the attacks. Our experiments show that pre-training may dramatically increase the transferability of adversarial examples, even when the target and surrogate's architectures are different: the larger the performance gain using pre-training, the larger the transferability. Differences in the development data between target and surrogate models considerably decrease the performance of the attack; this decrease is further amplified by difference in the model architecture. We believe these factors should be considered when developing security-critical MedIA systems planned to be deployed in clinical practice. We recommend avoiding using only standard components, such as pre-trained architectures and publicly available datasets, as well as disclosure of design specifications, in addition to using adversarial defense methods. When evaluating the vulnerability of MedIA systems to adversarial attacks, various attack scenarios and target-surrogate differences should be simulated to achieve realistic robustness estimates. The code and all trained models used in our experiments are publicly available.3 © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109452506

The research article is emphasized solving the nuclear and smart grid hardware security issues with the integration of field programmable gate array (FPGA), and implementing the latest Time Authenticated Cryptographic Identity Transmission (TACIT) cryptographic algorithm in the chip.

The state of the art of work is that the algorithm is implemented on FPGA hardware that provides the scalable design with different key sizes, and its integration enhances the grid hardware security and switching. It has been reported by similar state-of-the-art approaches, that the algorithm was limited in software, not implemented in a hardware chip.

While nations within geographically defined regions might be expected to share similar attitudes, values, and practices around cybersecurity, this analysis finds that regional differences can be explained largely by cross-national differences in development and the scale of Internet use. These results question the centrality of regions in shaping social and cultural attributes directly tied to cybersecurity capacity. However, the analysis identifies some countries with greater and some with lesser levels of maturity in capacity building than expected only on the basis of their development and scale of Internet use. Further research focused on the dynamics of under- and over-performance of different nations might illuminate where regional contexts could place a brake on, or provide an impetus for, under- or over-performance in cybersecurity capacity building. That said, national development and the scale of Internet use are the most explanatory of cultural attitudes, values, and practices of societies tied to cybersecurity, such as trust on the Internet. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105586566

The abnormal behavior clues are few because it appears rarely. To detect each abnormal behavior, the problem is transformed into a multi-class classification task where it lies into data imbalance representation. In data imbalance setting, minority classes are over-sampled to improve the performance of the classifier. Existing methods are unable to learn the distribution of the minority class and effects the performance of classifier. In this research, we introduced a data generative model (DGM) to improve the minority class presence in the anomaly detection domain. Our approach is based on a conditional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic samples for minority classes. It includes the KL-divergence to guide the model towards the true learning of minority class distribution. In this way, model learns the complex underlying data distribution and generates new samples. We performed experiments over the two benchmark datasets NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 that are publicly available to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with the existing approaches confirms the stability and superiority of our presented model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104888823

CBL instigates critical discussion, draws out relevant experiences from students, encourages questioning of accepted practices, and creates dialogue between theory and practice. There is unfortunately a lack of quality teaching resources to support CBL in information security management (ISM). In this paper, we address this need by developing, refining, and evaluating a teaching case of a hypothetical firm that suffers a catastrophic incident of intellectual property (IP) theft. Protecting IP is both complex and expensive as it involves developing enterprise-wide security mechanisms for the people, process, and technology dimensions of organizations. We drew the plot, narrative, characterization, dilemmas, and conflict from two landmark legal cases to focus on the three key areas of organizational security as defined by the joint task force on cybersecurity education—risk management, planning and strategy, and policy and governance. Our case was used to teach information security to Management Information Systems students enrolled in a Master’s Degree at the University of Melbourne, Australia. We subsequently developed a survey instrument to measure the utility of the teaching instrument for teaching. Survey data collected across 2 consecutive years indicated that students strongly agreed that the teaching case was relevant, realistic, engaging, challenging, and instructional. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104884795

I argue that the postwar Bretton Woods system he helped to create evolved from those views as a balanced middle ground between market forces and governments' desires for domestic economic stability. The gradual erosion of that balance in favor of the market has helped produce discontent over globalization and more nationalism in politics. Enhanced multilateral cooperation in key areas offers the hope of supporting globalization while better meeting voters' aspirations.

One growing source of failures for critical applications and infrastructures originates from cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited in attacks. One approach to mitigating these risks is verifying that critical applications and infrastructures are sufficiently protected by certification of products and services. However, reaching sufficient assurance levels for product certification may require detailed evaluation of product properties. An important challenge for product certification is dealing with product evolution: now that critical applications and infrastructures are connected they are being updated on a more frequent basis. To ensure continuity of certification, updates must be analysed to verify the impact on certified cybersecurity properties. Impacted properties need to be re-certified. This paper proposes a lightweight and flexible incremental certification process that can be integrated with DevSecOps practices to automate as much as possible evidence gathering and certification activities. The approach is illustrated on the Common Criteria product certification scheme and a firewall update on an automotive case study.

Based on prior research, a context-specific instrument was developed. This new instrument covered all five emotion components identified by the componential emotion approach. In total, 145 participants that experienced a cybersecurity breach reported on their appraisals, action tendencies, bodily reactions, expressions, subjective feelings, and regulation attempts. A principal component analysis on a total of 75 emotion reactions revealed a clear three-dimensional structure. The first dimension represented the extent to which the person was generally emotionally affected. The second dimension revealed constructive action tendencies and subjective feelings that were opposed to unconstructive action tendencies, expressions, and bodily reactions. The third dimension revealed cognitive motivational reactions that were opposed to affective reactions. This study clearly indicated that cybersecurity breaches do not only form a challenge for engineers, but also have important psychological ramifications that need to be addressed. Although some people have a tendency to react with constructive and proactive actions that are likely to limit the negative consequences of the cybersecurity breach, others experience a strong negative affective stress reaction and are unlikely to take the appropriate steps to deal with the security breach situation. These people, especially, can be expected to be vulnerable to psychological complaints and possibly psychopathology.

Among the different important operations to be performed for smooth generation, transmission, and distribution of power, maintaining the scheduled frequency, against any perturbations, is an important one. The load frequency control (LFC) operation actually governs this frequency regulation activity after the primary control. Due to CPS nature, the LFC operation is vulnerable to attacks, both from physical and cyber stand-points. The cyber-attack strategies ranges from a variety of attacks such as jamming the network communication, time-delay attack, and false data injection. Motivated by these perspectives, this paper studies the cybersecurity issues of the power systems during the LFC operation, and a survey is conducted on the security analysis of LFC. Various cyber-attack strategies, their mathematical models, and vulnerability assessments are performed to understand the possible threats and sources causing failure of frequency regulation. The LFC operation of two-area power systems is considered as a tutorial example to quantify the vulnerabilities. Mitigation strategies through control theoretic approaches are then reviewed and highlighted for LFC operation under cyber-attack. © 2021 by the authors.

The current transition from an industrial society to an information society is accompanied by the implementation of new technologies in every part of human activity. Increasing pressure to apply ICT in critical infrastructure resulted in the creation of new vulnerabilities. Traditional safety approaches are ineffective in a considerable number of cases. Therefore, machine learning another evolutionary step that provides robust solutions for extensive and sophisticated systems. The article focuses on cybersecurity research for industrial control systems that are widely used in the field of critical information infrastructure. Moreover, cybernetic protection for industrial control systems is one of the most important security types for a modern state. We present an adaptive solution for defense against cyber-attacks, which also consider the specifics of the industrial control systems environment. Moreover, the experiments are based on four machine learning algorithms (artificial neural network, recurrent neural network LSTM, isolation forest, and algorithm OCSVM).

The risk of unauthorized software changing real-world system behaviors is a major and critical infrastructure safety and security issue. Within this context, a NPP is one of the most emblematic examples of critical infrastructure cyber targets. In this study, an evaluation of the functional impact of a cyber-attack targeting specific digital equipment in a nuclear facility is performed by means of a nuclear power plant simulator specifically developed for cybersecurity assessments, deployment of realistic cyber-attack simulation scenarios, and collection and evaluation of simulated data. The Asherah nuclear power plant simulator reproduces the dynamic behavior of a two-loop 2,772 MWt pressurized water reactor (PWR) including primary, secondary, and tertiary loops, as well as selected network infrastructure elements, communication protocols, and control systems. The system is projected to survive cyber-attacks, to allow great flexibility for digital systems and network research, and to allow the capture of data for an a posteriori analysis.

It is a digital ecosystem, the next generation of Internet and network applications, promising a whole new world of distributed and open systems that can interact, self-organize, evolve, and adapt. These ecosystems transcend traditional collaborative environments, such as client-server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid models (e.g., web services), to become a self-organized, evolving, interactive environment. Understanding cyberspace as a system is critical if we are to properly design systems to exist within it. Considering it to be a digital ecosystem, where systems can adapt and evolve, will enable systems engineering to become more effective in the future of networks and the Internet. While most systems engineers have only anecdotal experience with large segments of this ecosystem, in today’s world all of them must come to understand it. Engineering any system, or portion of a system, begins with an understanding of the system. This paper presents two interrelated yet distinct foundational models of the ecosystem of cyberspace: a Systemigram to narrate the cyclical nature of cyber warfare, and a modified predator–prey model, as a mathematical model.

Cybercrimes have breached the multiple levels of cybersecurity that is one of the major issues in the IoT networks. Due to the rise in IoT applications, both devices and services are prone to security attacks and intrusions. The intrusion breaches the data packet extracted from different nodes deployed in the IoT network. Most of the intrusive attacks are very near variants of previously marked cyberattacks containing many repetitive data and features. And to detect the intrusion, the data packet needs to be analyzed. This article presents a novel scheme, i.e., dual-axis dimensionality reduction, that utilizes Kalman filter and salp swarm algorithm (coded as KF-SSA) for analyzing and minimizing the data packet. The proposed data reduction scheme is utilized with KELM-based multiclass classifier to efficiently detect intrusion in the IoT network (KF-SSA with KELM). The proposed method’s overall results are evaluated using standard intrusion detection datasets, i.e., NSL-KDD, KYOTO 2006+ (2015), CICIDS2017, and CICIDS2018 (AWS).

Five human factors domains served as a platform for our reflection, which included the last 20 years. Background: As usability studies continue to accumulate, there has been only a little past reflection on usability and contributions across a variety of applications. Our research provides a background for general usability, and we target specific usability research subareas within transportation, aging populations, autistic populations, telehealth, and cybersecurity. Method: “Usability” research was explored across five different domains within human factors. The goal was not to perform an exhaustive review but, rather, sample usability practices within several specific subareas. We focused on answering three questions: How was usability adopted? How was it measured? How was it framed in terms of value? Conclusion: We found that usability is very domain specific. Usability benchmarking studies and empirical standards are rare. The value associated with improving usability ranged widely—from monetary benefits to saving lives. Thus, researchers are motivated to further improve usability practices. A number of data collection and interpretation challenges still call for solutions. Application: Findings offer insight into the development of usability, as applied across a variety of subdomains. Our reflection ought to inform future theory development efforts. We are concerned about the lack of established benchmarks, which can help ground data interpretation. Future research should address this gap in the literature.

The lack of cybersecurity resources available to SMEs implies that they are less capable of dealing with cyber-attacks. Motivation to improve cybersecurity is often low, as the prerequisite knowledge and awareness to drive motivation is generally absent at SMEs. A solution that aims to help SMEs manage their cybersecurity risks should therefore not only offer a correct assessment but should also motivate SME users. From Self-Determination Theory (SDT), we know that by promoting perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness, people can be motivated to take action. In this paper, we explain how a threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment approach can help to address the needs outlined in SDT. We propose such an approach for SMEs and outline the data requirements that facilitate automation. We present a practical application covering various user interfaces, showing how our threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment approach turns SME data into prioritised, actionable recommendations. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113231484

The nature of cyber-attacks is gradually changing. Early cyber-attacks were usually conducted by curious personal hackers who used simple techniques to hack homepages and steal personal information. Lately, cyber attackers have started using sophisticated cyber-attack techniques that enable them to retrieve national confidential information beyond the theft of personal information or defacing websites. These sophisticated and advanced cyber-attacks can disrupt the critical infrastructures of a nation. Much research regarding cyber-attacks has been conducted; however, there has been a lack of research related to measuring cyber-attacks from the perspective of offensive cybersecurity. This motivated us to propose a methodology for quantifying cyber-attacks such that they are measurable rather than abstract. For this purpose, we identified each element of offensive cybersecurity used in cyber-attacks. We also investigated the extent to which the detailed techniques identified in the offensive cyber-security framework were used, by analyzing cyber-attacks. Based on these investigations, the complexity and intensity of cyber-attacks can be measured and quantified. We evaluated advanced persistent threats (APT) and fileless cyber-attacks that occurred between 2010 and 2020 based on the methodology we developed. Based on our research methodology, we expect that researchers will be able to measure future cyber-attacks. © 2021 by the authors.

At the same time, Industry 4.0 integrates IT processes and systems of production companies with IT solutions of cooperating companies that support a complete manu-factured product life cycle. Thus, the implementation of sustainable manufacturing implies a rapid increase in interfaces between IT solutions of cooperating companies. This, in turn, raises concerns about security among manufacturing company executives. The lack of a recognized methodology supporting the decision-making process of choosing the right methods and means of cybersecurity is, in effect, a significant barrier to the development of sustainable manufacturing. As a result, the propagation of technologies in Industry 4.0 and the implementation of the sustainable manufacturing framework in companies are slowing down significantly. The main novelty of this article, addressing the above deficiencies, is the creation, using the combined DEMATEL and ANP (DANP) and PROMETHEE II methods, of a ranking of the proposed three groups of measures, seven dimensions and twenty criteria to be implemented in companies to ensure cybersecurity in Industry 4.0 and facilitate the implementation of the sustainable production principles. The contribution of Industry 4.0 components and the proposed cybersecurity scheme to achieve the Sustainable Development goals, reducing the carbon footprint of companies and introducing circular economy elements was also indicated. Using DANP and PROMETHEE II, it can be concluded that: (i) the major crite-rion of cybersecurity in companies is validation and maintaining electronic signatures and seals; (ii) the most crucial area of cybersecurity is network security; (iii) the most significant group of measures in this regard are technological measures. © 2021 by the author.

To monitor and detect intrusion attempts under enormous network traffic, Security Operation Center (SOC) essentially exploits various security devices. Above all, Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has been operated in public/private sectors as a spearhead to fight against cyber threats. In particular, state-of-the-art technologies, especially ML and AI, have been being studied to achieve quick and accurate intrusion detection. Despite much effort to guarantee a secure network, however, SOCs are still struggling for overcoming various types of threats as well as attacks of similar form with benign traffic. Even though the advanced techniques may find out a complex and unknown attack, operating and managing them in real-world situations cause counterproductively more pressure to agents in the SOC. In order to solve these difficulties, this study introduces an easy-to-use framework to build intrusion detection models based on AI techniques, as well as to operate them depending on a situation using a graphical user interface. The framework supports generating various types of AI- and ML-based intrusion detection models with optimized parameters by only a few steps. Furthermore, an interactive graphical interface makes it easier to manage detection models according to different threat situations. Finally, the performance of models made by the framework is evaluated in terms of accuracy, especially under the real-world SOC environment with live network traffic. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116742759

These attacks have motivated numerous research efforts on attack detection, but little attention on what to do after detecting an attack. The importance of attack recovery is emphasized by the need to mitigate the attack's impact on a system and restore it to continue functioning. There are only a few works addressing attack recovery, but they all rely on prior knowledge of system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we propose Recovery-by-Learning, a data-driven attack recovery framework that restores CPS from sensor attacks. The framework leverages natural redundancy among heterogeneous sensors and historical data for attack recovery. Specially, the framework consists of two major components: state predictor and data checkpointer. First, the predictor is triggered to estimate systems states after the detection of an attack. We propose a deep learning-based prediction model that exploits the temporal correlation among heterogeneous sensors. Second, the checkpointer executes when no attack is detected. We propose a double sliding window based checkpointing protocol to remove compromised data and keep trustful data as input to the state predictor. Third, we implement and evaluate the effectiveness of our framework using a realistic data set and a ground vehicle simulator.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is largely adopted in an IoT context to provide security services such as key-exchange and digital signature. For Real-Time IoT applications, hardware acceleration for ECC-based algorithms can be mandatory to meet low-latency and low-power/energy requirements. In this paper, we propose a fast and configurable hardware accelerator for NIST P-256/-521 elliptic curves, developed in the context of the European Processor Initiative. The proposed architecture supports the most used cryptography schemes based on ECC such as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV).

A simulated approach to extract power traces has been used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to classical algorithms for Point Multiplication. A constant-time version of the Shamir’s Trick has been adopted to speed-up the Double-Point Multiplication and modular inversion is executed using Fermat’s Little Theorem, reusing the internal modular multipliers.

With an increase in more wired and wireless connections and devices on SME networks, unpredictable malicious activities and interruptions have risen. Finding the harmony between the advancement of technology and costs has always been a balancing act particularly in convincing the finance directors of these SMEs to invest in capital towards their IT infrastructure. This paper looks at various devices that currently are in the market to detect intrusions and look at how these devices handle prevention strategies for SMEs in their working environment both at home and in the office, in terms of their credibility in handling zero-day attacks against the costs of achieving so. The experiment was set up during the 2020 pandemic referred to as COVID-19 when the world experienced an unprecedented event of large scale. The operational working environment of SMEs reflected the context when the UK went into lockdown. Pre-pandemic would have seen this experiment take full control within an operational office environment; however, COVID-19 times has pushed us into a corner to evaluate every aspect of cybersecurity from the office and keeping the data safe within the home environment. The devices chosen for this experiment were OpenSource such as SNORT and pfSense to detect activities within the home environment, and Cisco, a commercial device, set up within an SME network. All three devices operated in a live environment within the SME network structure with employees being both at home and in the office. All three devices were observed from the rules they displayed, their costs and machine learning techniques integrated within them. The results revealed these aspects to be important in how they identified zero-day attacks. The findings showed that OpenSource devices whilst free to download, required a high level of expertise in personnel to implement and embed machine learning rules into the business solution even for staff working from home. However, when using Cisco, the price reflected the buy-in into this expertise and Cisco’s mainframe network, to give up-to-date information on cyber-attacks. The requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulations Act (GDPR) were also acknowledged as part of the broader framework of the study. Machine learning techniques such as anomaly-based intrusions did show better detection through a commercially subscription-based model for support from Cisco compared to that of the OpenSource model which required internal expertise in machine learning. A cost model was used to compare the outcome of SMEs’ decision making, in getting the right framework in place in securing their data. In conclusion, finding a balance between IT expertise and costs of products that are able to help SMEs protect and secure their data will benefit the SMEs from using a more intelligent controlled environment with applied machine learning techniques, and not compromising on costs. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112109891

The systematic review aims to consolidate the current literature being reported upon human behaviour resulting in security gaps that mitigate the cyber defence strategy adopted by healthcare organisations. Additionally, the paper also reviews the organisational risk assessment methodology implemented and the policies being adopted to strengthen cybersecurity. Methods: The topic of cybersecurity within healthcare and the clinical environment has attracted the interest of several researchers, resulting in a broad range of literature. The inclusion criteria for the articles in the review stem from the scope of the five research questions identified. To this end, we conducted seven search queries across three repositories, namely (i) PubMed®/MED-LINE; (ii) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and (iii) Web of Science (WoS), using key words related to cybersecurity awareness, training, organisation risk assessment methodologies, policies and recommendations adopted as counter measures within health care. These were restricted to around the last 12 years. Results: A total of 70 articles were selected to be included in the review, which addresses the complexity of cybersecurity measures adopted within the healthcare and clinical environments. The articles included in the review highlight the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats stemming from exploiting IT infrastructures to more advanced attacks launched with the intent of exploiting human vulnerability. A steady increase in the literature on the threat of phishing attacks evidences the growing threat of social engineering attacks. As a countermeasure, through the review, we identified articles that provide methodologies resulting from case studies to promote cybersecurity awareness among stakeholders. The articles included highlight the need to adopt cyber hygiene practices among healthcare professionals while accessing social media platforms, which forms an ideal test bed for the attackers to gain insight into the life of healthcare professionals. Additionally, the review also includes articles that present strategies adopted by healthcare organisations in countering the impact of social engineering attacks. The evaluation of the cybersecurity risk assessment of an organisation is another key area of study reported in the literature that recommends the organisation of European and international standards in countering social engineering attacks. Lastly, the review includes articles reporting on national case studies with an overview of the economic and societal impact of service disruptions encountered due to cyberattacks. Discussion: One of the limitations of the review is the subjective ranking of the authors associated to the relevance of literature to each of the research questions identified. We also acknowledge the limited amount of literature that focuses on human factors of cybersecurity in health care in general; therefore, the search queries were formulated using well-established cybersecurity related topics categorised according to the threats, risk assessment and organisational strategies reported in the literature. © 2021 by the authors.

Hence, POC systems often handle personal health information; and consequently, their cybersecurity and privacy requirements are of crucial importance. While, assessing these requirements is a significant task. In this work, we propose a use case approach to assess specifications of cybersecurity and privacy requirements of POC systems in a structured and self-contained form. Such an approach is appropriate since use cases are one of the most common means adopted by developers to derive requirements. As a result, we detail a use case approach in the framework of a real-based healthcare IT infrastructure that includes a health information system, integration engines, application servers, web services, medical devices, smartphone apps and medical modalities (all data simulated) together with the interaction with participants. Since our use case also sustains the analysis of cybersecurity and privacy risks in different threat scenarios, it also supports decision making and the analysis of compliance considerations. © 2021 by the authors.

Herein, we put forward a deep learning-empowered adaptive framework, which is specifically implemented by a proposed Timely-Focusing-Optical-Transformation-Net (TFOTNet), and it effectively tackles the grand challenge of real-time light focusing and refocusing through time-variant media without complicated computation. The introduction of recursive fine-tuning allows timely focusing recovery, and the adaptive adjustment of hyperparameters of TFOTNet on the basis of medium changing speed efficiently handles the spatiotemporal non-stationarity of the medium. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive recursive algorithm with the proposed network significantly improves light focusing and tracking performance over traditional methods, permitting rapid recovery of an optical focus from degradation. It is believed that the proposed deep learning-empowered framework delivers a promising platform towards smart optical focusing implementations requiring dynamic wavefront control. © 2021 Chinese Laser Press.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110267372

Definite advantages exist with respect to the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning in pathology, including cytopathology. However, there are also unique challenges in this regard. Summary: This review discusses cytology-specific challenges, including the need to implement digital cytology prior to AI; the large file sizes and increased acquisition times for whole slide images in cytology; the routine use of multiple stains, such as Papanicolaou and Romanowsky stains; the lack of high-quality annotated datasets on which to train algorithms; and the considerable computer resources required, in terms of both computer infrastructure and skilled personnel, for computing and storage of data. Global concerns regarding AI that are certainly applicable to cytology include the need for model validation and continued quality assurance, ethical issues such as the use of patient data in developing algorithms, the need to develop regulatory frameworks regarding what type of data can be utilized and ensuring cybersecurity during data collection and storage, and algorithm development. Key Messages: While AI will likely play a role in cytology practice in the future, applying this technology to cytology poses a unique set of challenges. A broad understanding of digital pathology and algorithm development is desirable to guide the development of algorithms, as well as the need to be cognizant of potential pitfalls to avoid when incorporating the technology in practice. © 2020 S.

Therefore, it remains crucial to perform a cybersecurity risk assessment of CIED and the systems they rely on to determine the gravity of threats, address the riskiest ones on a priority basis, and develop effective risk management plans. In this study, we carry out such risk assessment according to the ISO/IEC 27005 standard and the NIST SP 800-30 guide. We employed a threat-oriented analytical approach and divided the analysis into three parts, an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks, a scenario-based analysis to measure the probability of occurrence of threats, and a combined analysis to identify the riskiest attack outcomes. The results show that vulnerabilities on the RF interface of CIED represent an acceptable risk, whereas the network and Internet connectivity of the systems they rely on represent an important potential risk.

The risk of IVN devices has still been insecure and vulnerable due to the complex data-intensive architectures which greatly increase the accessibility to unauthorized networks and the possibility of various types of cyberattacks. Therefore, the detection of cyberattacks in IVN devices has become a growing interest. With the rapid development of IVNs and evolving threat types, the traditional machine learning-based IDS has to update to cope with the security requirements of the current environment. Nowadays, the progression of deep learning, deep transfer learning, and its impactful outcome in several areas has guided as an effective solution for network intrusion detection. This manuscript proposes a deep transfer learning-based IDS model for IVN along with improved performance in comparison to several other existing models. The unique contributions include effective attribute selection which is best suited to identify malicious CAN messages and accurately detect the normal and abnormal activities, designing a deep transfer learning-based LeNet model, and evaluating considering real-world data. To this end, an extensive experimental performance evaluation has been conducted. The architecture along with empirical analyses shows that the proposed IDS greatly improves the detection accuracy over the mainstream machine learning, deep learning, and benchmark deep transfer learning models and has demonstrated better performance for real-time IVN security. © 2021 by the authors.

With the aim to understand this lack of consensus, this article provides a comprehensive literature review of papers extracted from relevant databases (IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science). Our results show that there is not a well-established psychological theory explaining the role of neuroticism in the phishing context. We sustain that non-representative samples and the lack of homogeneity amongst the studies might be the culprits behind this lack of consensus on the role of neuroticism on phishing susceptibility. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115844421

We prove that this family of dynamics in its general form with time-dependent parameters is globally attractive when the time-dependent parameters are ergodic, and is (almost) periodic when the time-dependent parameters have the stronger properties of being (almost) periodic. Our results supersede the state-of-the-art ones, including the recent result that the same family of dynamics in the special case of time-independent parameters is globally convergent.

The integration of UAVs, 5G, and satellite technologies has prompted telecommunication networks to evolve to provide higher-quality and more stable service to remote areas. However, security concerns with UAVs are growing as UAV nodes are becoming attractive targets for cyberattacks due to enormously growing volumes and poor and weak inbuilt security. In this paper, we propose a UAV-and satellite-based 5G-network security model that can harness machine learning to effectively detect of vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. The solution is divided into two main parts: the model creation for intrusion detection using various machine learning (ML) algorithms and the implementation of ML-based model into terrestrial or satellite gateways. The system identifies various attack types using realistic CSE-CIC IDS-2018 network datasets published by Canadian Establishment for Cybersecurity (CIC). It consists of seven different types of new and contemporary attack types. This paper demonstrates that ML algorithms can be used to classify benign or malicious packets in UAV networks to enhance security. Finally, the tested ML algorithms are compared for effectiveness in terms of accuracy rate, precision, recall, F1-score, and false-negative rate. The decision tree algorithm performed well by obtaining a maximum accuracy rate of 99.99% and a minimum false negative rate of 0% in detecting various attacks as compared to all other types of ML classifiers. © 2021 by the authors.

Software vulnerabilities are increasing rapidly, whereas methods to analyze and cope with them depend on manual analyses, which result in a slow response. In recent years, studies concerning the prediction of vulnerabilities or the detection of patterns of previous vulnerabilities have been conducted by applying deep learning algorithms in an automated vulnerability search based on source code. However, existing methods target only certain security vulnerabilities or make limited use of source code to compile information. Few studies have been conducted on methods that represent source code as an embedding vector. Thus, this study proposes a deep learning-based automated vulnerability analysis system (AutoVAS) that effectively represents source code as embedding vectors by using datasets from various projects in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD). To evaluate AutoVAS, we present and share a dataset for deep learning models. Experimental results show that AutoVAS achieves a false negative rate (FNR) of 3.62%, a false positive rate (FPR) of 1.88%, and an F1-score of 96.11%, which represent lower FNR and FPR values than those achieved by other approaches. We further apply AutoVAS to nine open-source projects and detect eleven vulnerabilities, most of which are missed by the other approaches we experimented with. Notably, we discovered three zero-day vulnerabilities, two of which were patched after being informed by AutoVAS. The other vulnerability received the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID after being detected by AutoVAS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106225546

However, such systems are vulnerable to Cybersecurity attacks that can affect the reliability and integrity of the delivered services. Sensors, planted at smart homes or equipped with smart appliances, are highly exposed to identity theft. Intruders can recognize through the understanding of the exchanged data, their locations, or knowing their associated services. Such information might make the home resident vulnerable to life attacks. Therefore, protecting sensors identities in smart home systems is of high interest in this domain. This paper introduces a novel technique that protects sensors’ identity from being recognized through cordless communication environments. Our proposed approach utilizes a three-phase technique that controls a synchronized queue among connected sensors and keeps their identity hidden from outsiders. The proposed approach preserves the linearity of time that is required to manage the protection of the home network. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on four different smart homes datasets. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis to measure how our proposed approach is affected by different environmental variables. The results indicated that the proposed approach provides a significant performance in protecting sensors identities in smart home area networks.

There is a set of factors that can help in determining the security maturity level, such as technology, people, and infrastructure.

Also, the proposed process capability controls influence both levels. The proposed model helps the organizations bridging the cybersecurity gaps. These gaps relate to talent, technology, organizational units, financial, management and operations gaps. Thus, the model helps the cybersecurity auditors to create a comprehensive plan for measuring the security level of the organization. This plan can manage and develop the organization's automated countermeasures. Also, it can help in applying the suitable standard and framework based on the organization's daily operation.

High-end GNSS timing receivers combined with terrestrial cesium clocks and specific transport protocols can indeed satisfy such synchronization requirements by granting sub-nanosecond accuracy.

The relatively recent decentralisation of the grid infrastructure with the integration of Distributed Renewable Energy Resources (DRES) in synergy with the widely adopted demand-response business model, has undoubtedly broadened the spectrum of attack surface enabling energy theft. Conventional data-driven energy theft detection schemes have a strong dependency on assessing the spatio-temporal patterns of SCADA measurements aggregated at the Distribution System Operator (DSO) or Transmission System Operator (TSO) with minimal consideration of the intrinsic weather patterns related to individual DRES deployments. Hence, theft scenarios instrumented by DRES owners consuming the energy they produce (i.e., prosumers) can effectively be stealthy and hard to spot. Therefore, in this work we introduce a data-driven, SCADA-agnostic energy theft detection framework explicit to DRES-based scenarios. We provide a comprehensive formalisation of a DRES-based theft attack model and further assess the performance of our framework by utilising and relating freely available third-party weather measurements with real solar and wind turbine deployments in Australia and France. Evidently, our proposed framework yields an energy theft detection accuracy rate of over 98% with optimal computational costs.

With increased system complexity, deep learning-based stability assessment approaches are promising to address the shortfalls of the traditional time-domain simulation-based approaches. However, in the field of computer vision, the deep learning models are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. Although this vulnerability has been noticed by the energy informatics research, the domain-specific analysis on the requirements imposed for implementing effective adversarial examples is still lacking. These attack requirements, albeit reasonable in computer vision tasks, can be too stringent in the context of power grids. In this paper, we systematically investigate the requirements and discuss the credibility of six representative adversarial example attacks for a case study of voltage stability assessment for the New England 10-machine 39-bus system. We show that (1) compromising the voltage traces of half of transmission system buses is a rule of thumb requirement; (2) the universal adversarial perturbations that are independent of the original clean voltage trajectory have the same credibility as the widely studied false data injection attacks on power grid state estimation, while other adversarial example attacks are less credible; (3) the universal perturbations can be effectively defended with strong adversarial training. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109281797

NIDSs analyse network traffic to detect malicious content generated from different types of cyber-attacks. Though NIDSs can classify frequent attacks correctly, their performance declines on infrequent network intrusions. This paper proposes LIO-IDS based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier and Improved One-vs-One technique for handling both frequent and infrequent network intrusions. LIO-IDS is a two-layer Anomaly-based NIDS (A-NIDS) that detects different network intrusions with high Accuracy and low computational time. Layer 1 of LIO-IDS identifies intrusions from normal network traffic by using the LSTM classifier. Layer 2 uses ensemble algorithms to classify the detected intrusions into different attack classes. This paper also proposes an Improved One-vs-One (I-OVO) technique for performing multi-class classification at the second layer of the proposed LIO-IDS. In contrast to the traditional OVO technique, the proposed I-OVO technique uses only three classifiers to test each sample, thereby reducing the testing time significantly. Also, oversampling techniques have been used at Layer 2 to enhance the detection ability of the proposed LIO-IDS. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in terms of Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, Receiver Characteristics Operating (ROC) curve, Area Under ROC (AUC) values, training time and testing time for the NSL-KDD, CIDDS-001, and CICIDS2017 datasets. The proposed LIO-IDS shows significant improvement in the results as compared to its counterparts.

This paper proposes a new anomaly detection algorithm for IDS, where a machine learning algorithm is applied to detect deviations from legitimate traffic, which may indicate an intrusion. To improve computing efficiency, a sliding window approach is applied where the analysis is applied on large sequences of network flows statistics. This paper proposes a novel approach based on the transformation of the network flows statistics to gray images on which Gray level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) are applied together with an entropy measure recently proposed in literature: the 2D Dispersion Entropy. This approach is applied to the recently public IDS data set CIC-IDS2017.

Therefore, the evaluation of the effectiveness of smart environment platforms based on WSNs has to consider the system performance when data collection is executed under jamming attacks. In this work, we propose an experimental testbed to analyze the performance of a WSN using the IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA unslotted mode under jamming attacks in terms of goodput, packet receive rate (PRR), and energy consumption to assess the risk for users and the network in the smart scenario. The experimental results show that constant and reactive jamming strategies severely impact the evaluated performance metrics and the variance’ of the received signal strength (RSS) for some signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) ranges. The measurements obtained using the experimental testbed were correlated with analytical models. The results show that in the presence of one interferer, for SINR values higher than 4.5 dB, the PRR is almost 0.99, and the goodput 3.05 Kbps, but the system performance is significantly degraded when the amount of interferers increases. Additionally, the energy efficiency associated with reactive strategies is superior to the constant attack strategy. Finally, based on the evaluated metrics and with the proposed experimental testbed, our findings offer a better understanding of jamming attacks on the sensor devices in real smart scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, there is a need to augment the existing security schemes with anomaly detection schemes which can differentiate normal vehicle data from malicious and faulty data.

Current healthcare IS and mobile analytics research focuses on studying the system, device, and provided services, and is in need of an end-to-end solution to comprehensively recognize ADLs based on mobile sensor data. This study adopts the design science paradigm and employs advanced deep learning algorithms to develop a novel hierarchical, multiphase ADL recognition framework to model ADLs at different granularities.

In view of security, we have identified another research direction based on the attenuation impact of rain in WCN. An approach is initiated by an eavesdropper in which a secure communication environment is degraded by generating artificial rain (AR), which creates an abatement in the secrecy rate, and the cybersecurity gets compromised. By doing so, an attacking scenario is perceived, in which an intruder models a half-duplex (HD) attack. HD specifies the attack on the downlink instead of targeting both uplink and downlink. This allows the attacker to alleviate the miss rate of the attacking attempts. The layout for the HD attack is explained using radio resource control (RRC) setup. Further, we have determined and examined the performance parameters such as secrecy rate, energy efficiency, miss rate, and sensitivity in the presence of AR. Further comparison of rural and urban scenarios in the presence and absence of AR is carried out concerning the variation in secrecy rate with respect to the millimeter-wave frequencies and distance. Lastly, the methodology of the HD attack is simulated, revealing that the HD attack maintains a low miss rate with improved performance as compared to the performance and miss rate attained by the full-duplex attack. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110908841

The problem with SOC is that when building up their own SOC or hiring a third-party to provide SOC, organizations are not able to apply adequate criteria or standard frameworks. The aim of the study is to lay the foundations for developing a modern system of systematic operation centers for the next generation (NGSOC) for IIoT climate. This paper contains thorough, qualitative literature survey on the implementation of a Security Operation Centre (SOC). A comparative study is carried out using a variety of previous research sources and a literature review. The findings from the report show that previous research is not adequately guided, especially in the safety and technical aspects of the building block of the SOC. It is hoped that by proposing the framework, cybersecurity threat prevention and identification would be strengthened even further. The success of the NGSOC will ultimately be determined by the integration of individuals, procedure, and technology. © 2021, Semnan University, Center of Excellence in Nonlinear Analysis and Applications.

While the decline of the American-led order is not a new trend, it has been accelerated under the Trump administration, which focused on domestic policies and left the global stage in disarray. The challenges are many for the new president, and many pressures can already be felt. Biden’s administration is under high expectations to stabilize the international system and deal with the many issues that the world faces: economic recovery, COVID-19, climate change, cybersecurity, and relations with China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, to name but a few. Yet, while the Biden presidency is—wrongly—understood as “U.S. back to normal,” the international stage has evolved. The article thus argues that restoring American world leadership means modifying that leadership and adapting it to the new reality. Building on management theories and the English School of international relations theories, the research presents a theoretical framework for reinventing and reconstructing a new form of leadership. It then applies the resulting strategic design to the Biden administration’s objectives and policies in the form of seven strategic recommendations.

Drawing insight from organisational theory literature, we develop a multi-theory model, combining the elements of the theory of planned behaviour, competing value framework, and technology - organisational and environmental theory to examine how the organisational mechanisms interact with espoused cultural values and employee cognitive belief to influence cybersecurity control procedures. Using a structured questionnaire, we deployed structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the survey data obtained from public sector information technology organisations in Nigeria to test the hypothesis on the relationship of socio-organisational mechanisms and techno-cultural factors with other key determinants of employee security behaviour. The results showed that knowledge of cybersecurity and employee cognitive belief significantly influence the employees' intentions to comply with organisational cybersecurity control mechanisms. The research further noted that the influence of organisational elements such as leadership on employee security behaviour is mediated by espoused cultural values while the impact of employee cognitive belief is moderated by security technologies. For effective cybersecurity compliance, leaders and policymakers are therefore to promote organisational security initiatives that ensure incorporation of cybersecurity principles and practices into job descriptions, routines, and processes.

Since security vulnerabilities incur a very high degree of financial, reputational, informational, and organizational security compromise, it is imperative that a baseline for standard compliance be established. The selection of security standards and extracting requirements from those standards in an organizational context is a tedious task.

Objective: This article aims at systematically reviewing ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures to identify and classify ML approaches, feature engineering techniques, evaluation datasets, and performance metrics used for these countermeasures. This review also aims at identifying gaps in research on ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures. Method: We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to select and review 92 papers.

This progress has arisen in the form of state-of-the-art automated giant vehicles with Autonomous Haulage Systems (AHS) that can transport ore without human intervention. Like CPS, AHS enable autonomous and/or remote control of physical systems (e.g., mining trucks). Thus, similar to CPS, AHS are also susceptible to cyber attacks such as Wi-Fi De-Auth and GPS attacks. With the use of the AHS, several mining activities have been strengthened due to increasing the efficiency of operations. Such activities require ensuring accurate data collection from which precise information about the state of the mine should be generated in a timely and consistent manner.

For the case of the unbalanced residential distribution grid, the state-estimating operation, which is conducted at a regional scale, is considered as an application of the edge computing-based Internet of Things (IoT). While the outcome of the SE is important to the subsequent control activities, its accuracy heavily depends on the data integrity of the information collected from the scattered measurement devices. This fact exposes the vulnerability of the SE module under the effect of data-driven attacks. Among these, the false data-injection (FDI) attack is attracting much attention due to its capability to interfere with the normal operation of the network without being detected. This article presents an attack design scheme based on a nonlinear physical-constraint model that is able to produce an FDI attack with theoretically stealthy characteristic. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme, simulations with the IEEE 13-node test feeder and the WSCC 9-bus system are conducted. The experimental results indicate that not only the false-positive rate of the bad data detection mechanism is 100% but the physical consequence of the attack is severe.

Risk-based access control models provide many security solutions to risk management in dynamic environments such as cloud computing.

As interstate competition in orbit increases, so does the threat of attacks abusing these information-sharing relationships. This paper offers one of the first considerations of defense techniques against SSA deceptions. Building on historical precedent and real-world SSA data, we simulate an attack whereby an SSA operator seeks to disguise spy satellites as pieces of debris.

Method: We use a systematic literature review method to search and analyze existing MTD for IoT techniques up to July 2020. We evaluated the existing techniques in terms of security foundations and real-world deployability using the evidence they provide. We define and use entropy-related metrics to categorize them. This is the first MTD survey to use Shannon's entropy metric empirically. Results: Thirty-two distinct MTD for IoT techniques exist: 54% are Network-layer-based, 50% present strong evidence about their real-world deployment, and 64% have weak security foundations. Conclusion: MTD for IoT is a feasible cyberdefense approach. A variety of proposals exist, with evidence about their implementation and evaluation.

Threat modeling which is done on the system design phase is an efficient way for securing systems; preventing system flaws is easier and more efficient than patching the security of the system later on. Therefore, many Secure Software Development methods include threat modeling as an integral part of the methodology. STRIDE is a popular threat modeling method used by many practitioners. Threat modelers using the STRIDE method work with abstract threat categories, and would benefit learning about the information about current system weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The information is available on the weakness and vulnerability databases (such as the CWE and the CVE). To our knowledge, there exists no mapping between the STRIDE threats and the actual weaknesses and vulnerabilities listed on the databases, thus hindering the effectiveness of the threat modeling and the DevSecOps and Secure Software Development Life Cycle methods as a whole. This work attempts to bridge the gap by exploring possible mappings between the STRIDE threats and the CWE weaknesses, with the goal of improving the cybersecurity processes from end to end. The paper explores three different approaches for mapping the STRIDE to the CWE weakness database, and discusses the findings. The paper concludes that the mapping between the STRIDE and the CWE 'Technical Impact' and 'Scope' elements of the CWE entries is the most prominent for the mapping. Paper also shows that other mappings were challenged by the different conceptual backgrounds between the threats and the weaknesses. The paper also discusses the challenges caused by the inherent vagueness of the items within the frameworks and the CWE and CVE databases, causing that the mappings to these databases remain largely as a manual tasks, which should be carried out by the domain experts. © 2021 FRUCT.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107404406

The vast address space of IPv6, however, makes it infeasible to apply a brute-force approach for scanning the entire network. Even worse, the extremely uneven distribution of IPv6 active addresses results in a low hit rate for active scanning. To address the problem, we propose 6Hit, a reinforcement learning-based target generation method for active address discovery in the IPv6 address space. It first divides the IPv6 address space into different regions according to the structural information of a set of known seed addresses. Then, it allocates exploration resources according to the reward of the scanning on each region. Based on the evaluative feedback from existing scanning results, 6Hit optimizes the subsequent search direction to regions that have a higher density of activity addresses. Compared with other state-of-the-art target generation methods, 6Hit achieves better performance on hit rate. Our experiments over real-world networks show that 6Hit achieves 3.5% - 11.5% hit rate for the eight candidate datasets, which is 7.7% - 630% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111929683

Recently, the trend of human identification has been directed to human biometrics, which can be used to recognize persons based on some physiological or behavioral characteristics that they own, such as fingerprint, iris, and biosignals. There are several types of human biosignals including electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. This paper presents a human identification system based on PPG signals. The proposed system consists of three main phases: signal acquisition, signal pre-processing, and feature extraction/classification. The pre-processing phase involves denoising of the acquired signal, transformation of the 1D signal sequence into a 2D image, and computation of the spectrogram. Feature extraction is carried out on the images obtained from the pre-processing phase. Features are extracted from the images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed CNN model consists of a sequence of convolutional (CNV) and pooling layers. Finally, the obtained feature maps are fed to the classifier to discriminate human identities. The proposed identification algorithm is applied on signals with and without an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.5% with the spectrogram representation and 89.8% with the 2D image representation, in the absence of noise. In addition, the paper gives a discussion of the efficiency of denoising techniques such as wavelet denoising, Savitzky–Golay and Kalman filtering, when involved with the proposed algorithm. The simulation results prove that the wavelet dencoising technique has a best performance among the discussed noise reduction techniques. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101203434

Our method is a network flow-based botnet detection technique, and we use the input packet, protocol, source port, destination port, and time as features of our algorithms.

However, depending on the domain, only their minor fraction has met wider adoption. This paper brings attention to the concept of applicability - the notion that is well acknowledged in the scientific field but have not been analysed with respect to determinants, metrics and systematisation. The primary objective of the study was to identify applicability determinants and metrics and consolidate them into a taxonomy, based on a systematic process. To achieve the objective, a methodological literature review supported with operationalisation activities were applied. As a result, more than thirty descriptors of applicability were introduced in the proposed applicability taxonomy, and a similar number of metrics has been elicited. Based on them, a questionnaire for evaluation of the method's applicability was created and applied to the evaluation of a currently developed cybersecurity risk assessment method that aims at broader market uptake. The analysis provided indications on its further developments, but also findings of a more universal character. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107412518

Defence mechanisms are generally articulated around tools that trace and store information in several ways, the simplest one being the generation of plain text files coined as security logs. Such log files are usually inspected, in a semi-automatic way, by security analysts to detect events that may affect system integrity, confidentiality and availability. On this basis, we propose a parameter-free method to detect security incidents from structured text regardless its nature. We use the Normalized Compression Distance to obtain a set of features that can be used by a Support Vector Machine to classify events from a heterogeneous cybersecurity environment. In particular, we explore and validate the application of our method in four different cybersecurity domains: HTTP anomaly identification, spam detection, Domain Generation Algorithms tracking and sentiment analysis.

Consequently, access to information has become easier. However, new types of cybersecurity threats that typically result in data loss and information misuse have emerged simultaneously. Therefore, maintaining data privacy in complex systems is important and necessary, particularly in organizations where the vast majority of individuals interacting with these systems is students. In most cases, students engage in data breaches and digital misconduct due to the lack of knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity and the consequences of cybercrime. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the level of cybersecurity awareness and user compliance among undergraduate students at Majmaah University using a scientific questionnaire based on several safety factors for the use of the Internet. We quantitatively evaluated the knowledge of cybercrime and protection among students to show the need for user education, training, and awareness. In this study, we used a quantitative research methodology and conducted different statistical tests, such as ANOVA, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett’s tests, to evaluate and analyze the hypotheses.

However, a massive EV penetration means a rise in electricity demand with negative consequences to the distribution systems (voltage drops, branches congestion, etc) if the charging infrastructure is not cybersecure and does not perform smart charging mechanisms. Furthermore, these new infrastructures and their operating procedures provide new chances to cyberattacks to be performed, aimed at either exploiting those grid vulnerabilities or acquiring some user's private information. Therefore, to ease the secure integration of EV charging infrastructures in the future network, this paper presents a three-level actuation methodology for charging infrastructures, which includes active management of EV supply equipment (EVSE) to allow dynamic control of charges, installation of ancillary protection systems, planning of EVSE's location within the distribution system and cybersecure management of the whole infrastructure. The presented methodology is based on a thorough analysis of the possible cyberattacks that may occur during the transactions of the charging process, as well as tests carried out on a real pilot, which demonstrate the possible impacts that an uncontrolled charging of the EV can have on the distribution network, thus identifying the vulnerabilities of the distribution network. © 2021 Publicaciones Dyna Sl.

Recent research works have recommended the use of Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) for botnet attack detection in IoT networks. However, for high feature dimensionality in the training data, high network bandwidth and a large memory space will be needed to transmit and store the data, respectively in IoT back-end server or cloud platform for Deep Learning (DL). Furthermore, given highly imbalanced network traffic data, the DRNN model produces low classification performance in minority classes. In this paper, we exploit the joint advantages of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder (LAE), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and DRNN to develop a memory-efficient DL method, named LS-DRNN. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated with the Bot-IoT dataset. Results show that the LAE method reduced the dimensionality of network traffic features in the training set from 37 to 10, and this consequently reduced the memory space required for data storage by 86.49%. SMOTE method helped the LS-DRNN model to achieve high classification performance in minority classes, and the overall detection rate increased by 10.94%.

The Controller Area Network (CAN) enables communication between components core to the car's safety and performance, and has been demonstrated to be particularly vulnerable to hacking and malicious cyber-intrusion. CAN intrusion detection systems have been envisaged. Signatures of known attacks might be used for detection, but this method holds many limitations. Although some attacks might change packet broadcast rates or add unknown packets onto the network, attacks that have little or no effect on these, yet can alter the packet data, have also been devised. We therefore test three novelty detection methods (Local Outlier Factor, Compound Classifier and One-Class Support Vector Machine) that might identify an attack based solely on anomalies in CAN packet field data-values. The methods compare values across a cluster of CAN packets broadcast from different control units, so potentially could identify an attacked control unit even when its subsequent fabricated payload data-values remain plausible. We test the methods on data from two different makes of car across a range of manipulation magnitudes, reflecting the unpredictability of attacks. Different training regimes are tested, enabling us to assess validity across journeys. We also consider the processes needed to determine the CAN fields that might be included in the intrusion detection cluster, and present algorithms for automating those processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102135799

Various attack detection methods are adopted in the research area to prevent an illegal user from accessing the resources. To resolve the vulnerabilities in the computing devices, an effective attack detection method, named, Moth Elephant Herding Optimisation (MEHO)-based stacked autoencoder approach is proposed in this research. Initially, the input data is passed into the pre-processing stage, where the data is cleaned by removing the noise and artefacts. The pre-processed data is further subjected to the feature selection stage, where the Class-Wise Information Gain technique (CIG) is used to select the essential features. The class-aware features, like traffic-based features, content-based features and basic features are selected efficiently. Finally, the attack detection is performed using the stacked autoencoder classifier, which is trained using the proposed MEHO algorithm. The MEHO algorithm is developed by integrating the Moth search (MS) algorithm and the Elephant Herding Optimisation (EHO).

Migration-based dynamic platform technique (DPT), one of MTD techniques, is expected to significantly improve cyberspace security by migrating service across multiple platforms according to the predefined policy. However, the existing random migration policies cause unnecessary cost when the service platform is not under attack, which indicates the necessity of combining DPT with traditional detection-based defense mechanism to make migration decision. In this paper, we propose a Continuous-Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP)-based dynamic platform defense model against multi-stage attacks, which can determine the optimal service migration timing based on the system reward. To maximize the expected total discounted reward of the system, we utilize the value iteration algorithm to determine the optimal policy which defines what action to be taken in a specific state. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate that our CTMDP-based dynamic platform defense model obtains higher expected total discounted reward than using random migration policies.

However, distributed control faces severe problems for maintaining the microgrid cybersecurity, which is due to the absence of central controllers for monitoring participating generation unit activities. This article proposes an observer-based resilient distributed control for AC microgrids that estimates and compensates false data injection (FDI) attacks on sensors and actuators. The proposed resilient control relies on an integrated distributed control structure, which restores the rated frequency/voltage and offers the proportional active/reactive power sharing with reduced exchanges of control signals. The proposed control has no limitation on the number of disrupted DGs and does not need access to the attack information. The {H} -{ {mathrm {infty }}} output feedback control is applied to guarantee the {L} -{2} -gain boundedness of the control system.

The project is implemented as part of the Digital Poland Operational Program for 2014–2020 by the Płużnica Commune Development Association in partnership with the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs and the Foundation of Active Development Initiatives. The authors limit themselves to presenting results of 75 trainings only in the municipalities of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, in which they had conducted the trainings on their own, in the capacity of certified instructors of digital competences, in the period of December 2018 – end of June 2019. Each participant of the training was obliged to take a pre-test consisting in 10 single-choice questions, that verified his digital competences (like use of search engines, digital resources, e-administration services, tools of cybersecurity). At the end of the training (consisting of the lecture with the presentation of tools) each participant had to solve the post-test to validate his knowledge (again, 10 single-choice questions with the pass threshold score of 75% of correct answers). Comparing the results of both tests, the authors of this article assessed the level of digital competence of participants’ group before and after the trainings. The conducted analyses proved that all the training groups increased their levels of digital competences. In the case of almost 55% of groups, an increase by one level was evidenced (51% for average to high competences, and 4% for low to average competences), and in the case of 35% of groups — by two levels (from low to high competences). Slightly above 10% of groups increased their already high level of competences that was featured initially. The obtained results are the evidence of the high effectiveness of the trainings. In their final outcome, as much as 72 training groups increased their initial levels of digital competences to the high level, and 3 to the average level. There was no group reported with a drop in the level of competences. The results of analyses indicate high effectiveness of the trainings conducted within the scope of the “E-Active Residents of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian and Łódź Voivodeships” project – at least with respect to the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. A large number of participants featuring average and low digital competences (89% before the training and 96% after the trainings) may be evidence for the unsatisfactory level of digital competences in Poland. On the other hand, a relatively high interest in the trainings among the seniors (aged 61 or older), may indicate that there is still a considerable need in Poland for initiating actions countering the digital exclusion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099257152

Given the threat landscape in IIoT systems, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) need to be prepared regarding their cybersecurity, react quickly, and strengthen their overall cybersecurity. For instance, with the application of machine learning algorithms, security-related data can be analyzed predictively in order to be able to ward off a potential attack at an early stage. Since modern reference architectures for IIoT systems, such as RAMI 4.0 or IIRA, consider cybersecurity approaches on a high level and SMEs lack financial funds and knowledge, this paper conceptualizes a security analytics service used as a security add-on to these reference architectures.

The current understanding of Taiwan’s NIS draws mainly on Taiwan’s catch-up model, referring especially to export-oriented ICT industrialisation, and gives special credit to government-sponsored applied research institutes, such as the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). However, Taiwan nowadays is promoting economic transformation and the digital economy, with a central focus on 5+N flagship innovative industries, including the Asian Silicon Valley Development Initiative for the IoT and smart cities, green energy (offshore wind power and other kinds of renewable energy), the biomedical industry, the defense sector (cybersecurity included), new agriculture (for example precision agriculture) and the circular economy. Following this, the Institute for Information Industry (III) has recently repositioned itself as a ‘Digital Transformation Enabler’, while ITRI tends to focus on systemic innovations, by taking an approach of ‘Open Innovation System Platform’ (OISP). There is increasing awareness that digitalisation is transforming innovation and that digital transformation brings challenges to innovation management and innovation policies. Set against that backdrop, this chapter calls for a revisit to Taiwan’s NIS by examining the issue concerning what Taiwan’s transition from ICT industrialisation to the digital economy means to its innovation trajectory and innovation routines. Taiwan’s ICT industry is a legacy of its catch-up industrialisation, and it has to reinvent itself in order to evolve into the genuine ‘digital sector’ of the digital economy. For Taiwan to develop into a digital economy, the incumbents in the existing digital sector or new players from elsewhere have to master a variety of new digital technologies (hardware- or software-based), such as AI, the IoT, robotics and blockchain, and/or to harness the new technologies for innovative applications. This may enrich our understanding of the factors underlying industrial innovation in the era of the digital economy, especially for latecomer countries in transition. The chapter goes further to discuss some aspects of structural change in Taiwan’s NIS. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Gee San and Patarapong Intarakumnerd.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104732972

These characteristics make it challenging to detect and identify the attack stages using solutions that tend to be localized in space and time. In this work, we present Adept, a distributed framework to detect and identify the individual attack stages in a coordinated attack. Adept works in three phases. First, network traffic of IoT devices is processed locally for detecting anomalies with respect to their benign profiles. Any alert corresponding to a potential anomaly is sent to a security manager, where aggregated alerts are mined, using frequent itemset mining (FIM), for detecting patterns correlated across both time and space. Finally, using both alert-level and pattern-level information as features, we employ a machine learning approach to identify individual attack stages in the generated alerts. We carry out extensive experiments, with emulated and realistic network traffic; the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of its ability in attack-stage detection and identification. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100824245

With larger software bases and multiple external communication interfaces, the risks for new vulnerabilities and attack vectors on vehicles also increase. Therefore, modern cybersecurity validation is highly stressed for finding security vulnerabilities and robustness issues early and systematically at every stage of the product development process. The integration of a sophisticated fuzz testing program within the overall cybersecurity validation strategy allows for accommodating towards these challenging demands. In this paper, we review a general automotive cybersecurity engineering process containing functional testing, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, and highlight shortcomings that can be complemented by fuzz testing. We present how fuzz testing is not only beneficial to improve product security directly by detecting weaknesses, but also indirectly by providing input to allow enhancing other testing activities. Finally, we provide a suggestion for an updated cybersecurity engineering process, which gives guidance on when fuzz testing should be performed and how fuzz testing should interface with other testing activities. Our approach is compliant to the ISO/SAE DIS 21434 cybersecurity engineering process. The approach uses Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) together with Cybersecurity Assurance Levels (CALs) for the systematic identification of high-priority attack vectors and assignment of testing priorities. With this knowledge, it is possible to decide where, when and how often fuzz testing shall be applied for both finding unknown vulnerabilities and regressions in an automatized manner. This approach identifies issues earlier and with greater coverage than functional testing, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing could achieve on their own. As a result, by following this approach, the overall cybersecurity engineering process is more comprehensive, security remediation costs are lower, and resources for manual activities such as penetration testing are used more efficiently. © 2021 SAE International.

The crucial challenge of a digital certificate is to how design a secure certification authority management system that can counteract cyberattacks on the IIoT network. Moreover, current IIoT systems are not capable of implementing complex mathematical operations due to their constrained power capacity and processing capability. This paper proposes an effective, secure symmetric cryptographic mechanism (ESSC) based on the certificate authority management and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) to share a digital certificate among IIoT devices. The proposed certificate authority is used to securely exchange the shared secret key and to resolve the problem of spoofing attacks that may be used to impersonate the identity of the certificate author-ity. Also, ESSC uses the shared secret key to encrypt the sensitive data during transmission through the insecure communication channel. This research studies the adversary model for ESSC on IIoT and analyzes the cybersecurity of ESSC in the random oracle model. The findings that result from the experiments show that ESSC outperforms the baseline in terms of communication, computation, and storage costs. ESSC thus provides an adequate lightweight digital certificate management and cryptographic scheme which can help in the detection and prevention of several cyberattacks that can harm IIoT networks. © 2021 by the author.

However, with such volumes of private and personal data being stored in cloud computing infrastructures, security concerns have risen. Motivated to monitor and analyze adversarial activities, we deploy multiple honeypots on the popular cloud providers, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure, and operate them in multiple regions.

Our results highlight the attempt of threat actors to abuse popular services, which were widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote working, such as remote desktop sharing. Furthermore, the attacks seem to exit not only from countries that are commonly found to be the source of attacks, such as China, Russia and the United States, but also from uncommon ones such as Vietnam, India and Venezuela.

The feasibility of using many hidden layers and many neurons for each layer in the DL architectures enables a detailed analyzing capability for classification and segmentation issues. Advancing the learning performance and generalization capability of the models for big data is one of the major advantages of DL that makes it a mandatory requirement for especially the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Whereas tethering the sensing systems to the Internet enables remote control capabilities, communication, and coordination among the systems raises security vulnerability for many IoT devices. This study utilized DL algorithms, including deep belief networks and deep autoencoders, to perform an invasion detection application in IoT devices. The UNSW-NB15 database, collected from a realistic network to evaluate cybersecurity applications, was utilized for training the DL models. The study aims to design a DL architecture for the implementation of secured IoT and to assess the performance and robustness of DL algorithms for detecting IoT-based intrusions. The main contribution is SecureDeepNet-IoT, which is an adaptive multikernel cybersecurity platform for sensing inputs. The SecureDeepNet-IoT has achieved classification accuracy up to 95.05% and 94.39% for deep belief networks and deep neural networks, respectively. Deep autoencoder with extreme learning machine kernel has detected the IoT-based invasion with accuracy rates of 97.86% and 98.15% for binary and multiinvasion classification, respectively. In addition to high generalization capability, the deep autoencoder kernel reached rapid enough speed in detecting abnormal sensing values in IoT. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099957588

The existing state-of-the-art solutions, extensively rely on human decision making and correlation-based analysis, to understand the anomalous intent of an insider. This consequently leads to data breaches, hence making insider threats one of the biggest challenges faced by the cybersecurity community today. To deal with these issues, new access control architectures and models must focus on the integration of threat analytics, auto-resiliency, and fast response time to mitigate an ongoing threat in a timely manner. In this article, to address these issues and limitations, we propose an integrated access control policy regulation framework, designed on biological principles. The proposed framework provides the ground to efficiently integrate Threat Analytics with Policy Regulation Mechanism against insider threats. Another major contribution of this article is to model access control policy regulation mechanism as an auto-regulatory state transition system, which could autonomously change its state (policy configuration) in real-time against an emergent insider threat. As the last step, with the help of formal methods, we rigorously verify, evaluate, and test the performance of our proposed systems on a real-life threat test dataset. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098685259

In this context, a conceptual model of sustainable development with a focus on knowledge management and sharing will be proposed. The construct of knowledge management will be unpacked into a new three-layer model with a focus on the knowledge-human and data-machine spheres. Then, each sphere will be discussed with concentration on the learning and decision-making processes, the digital supporting systems and the human actors’ aspects. Moreover, the recombination of new knowledge development and contemporary knowledge management into one amalgamated construct will be proposed. The holistic conceptual model of knowledge management for sustainable development is comprised by time, cybersecurity and two alternative humanistic paradigms (Homo Technologicus and Homo Sustainabiliticus). Two additional particular models are discussed in depth. First, a recently proposed model of quantum organizational decision-making is elaborated.

We reviewed the literature on bot detection methods to extend the anomaly detection approaches used in bot detection schemes to IIoT fields. Finally, we proposed a process wherein the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was applied to identify features for efficiently detecting anomalous behavior in smart cities.

Our contribution is a novel framework for a process-based approach to quality assurance, as most of the published literature is primarily concerned with the experience of ABET accreditation of a solitary program. However, in this paper, we have presented a generic framework that ABET aspiring programs can instantiate in their preparation for ABET accreditation. We have validated these processes in our successful ABET accreditation application of the Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics program.

The study employed a quantitative design in which 57 SMEs from the Limpopo Province were surveyed using an online questionnaire. The study found that: (1) the level of cybersecurity threats awareness among decision-makers was high; (2) decision-makers preferred simple checklists and guidelines over conventional security policies, standards, and frameworks; and (3) decisionmakers considered financial risks, data and application security, and cloud service provider reliability as the main aspects to consider when evaluating Cloud BI applications. The study conceptualised a five-component security framework for evaluating Cloud BI applications, integrating key aspects of conventional security frameworks and methodologies. The framework was validated for relevance by IT specialists and acceptance by SME owners. The Spearman correlational test for relevance and acceptance of the proposed framework was found to be highly significant at p < 0.05. The study concluded that SMEs require user-friendly frameworks for evaluating Cloud BI applications. The major contribution of this study is the security evaluation framework conceptualised from the best practices of existing security standards and frameworks for use by decision-makers from small towns in Limpopo. The study recommends that future research consider end-user needs when customising or proposing new solutions for SMEs in small towns. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103186786

The cosimulation platform permits rigorous analysis of cybersecurity through detailed modeling of all system components. The DER coordinated control and communication systems implemented on the IEEE-34 bus benchmark consist of measurement, control and monitoring components including substation central controller, DER local controllers, synchrophasor network and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI).

An accurate passive operating system (OS) fingerprinting plays a critical role in effective network management and cybersecurity protection. Passive fingerprinting does not send probes that introduce extra load to the network and hence it has a clear advantage over active fingerprinting since it also reduces the risk of triggering false alarms. This article proposes and evaluates an advanced classification approach to passive OS fingerprinting by leveraging state-of-the-art classical machine learning and deep learning techniques. Our controlled experiments on benchmark data, emulated, and realistic traffic is performed using two approaches. Through an Oracle-based machine learning approach, we found that the underlying TCP variant is an important feature for predicting the remote OS. Based on this observation, we develop a sophisticated tool for OS fingerprinting that first predicts the TCP flavor using passive traffic traces and then uses this prediction as an input feature for another machine learning algorithm for predicting the remote OS from passive measurements. This article takes the passive fingerprinting problem one step further by introducing the underlying predicted TCP variant as a distinguishing feature. In terms of accuracy, we empirically demonstrate that accurately predicting the TCP variant has the potential to boost the evaluation performance from 84% to 94% on average across all our validation scenarios and across different types of traffic sources. We also demonstrate a practical example of this potential, by increasing the performance to 91.2% and 95.3% on average using a tool for loss-based and delay-based TCP variants prediction in an emulated setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the potential for using the knowledge of the TCP variant to significantly boost the accuracy of passive OS fingerprinting. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101716690

This interconnection enables the offering of functionality beyond the combined offering of each individual component, but at the same time increases the cyber risk of the overall system, as such risk propagates between and aggregates at component systems. The complexity of the resulting systems-of-systems in many cases leads to difficulty in analyzing cyber risk. Additionally, the selection of cybersecurity controls that will effectively and efficiently treat the cyber risk is commonly performed manually, or at best with limited automated decision support. In this work, we propose a method for analyzing risk propagation and aggregation in complex CPSs utilizing the results of risk assessments of their individual constituents. Additionally, we propose a method employing evolutionary programming for automating the selection of an optimal set of cybersecurity controls out of a list of available controls, that will minimize the residual risk and the cost associated with the implementation of these measures. We illustrate the workings of the proposed methods by applying them to the navigational systems of two variants of the Cyber-Enabled Ship (C-ES), namely the autonomous ship and the remotely controlled ship. The results are sets of cybersecurity controls applied to those components of the overall system that have been identified in previous studies as the most vulnerable ones; such controls minimize the residual risk, while also minimizing the cost of implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

We draw on the information gap theory of curiosity to investigate the impact of security risk awareness and curiosity on the intention to play online games. Using a hypothetical scenario that simulates a real event and a total of 301 responses collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and analyzed using LISREL 8.80, we provide evidence of how the awareness of threats incites curiosity and invites exploratory behavior that can lead to undesirable consequences. Our results reveal that security risk awareness has a positive and significant effect on both perceived risk and curiosity, while curiosity has a negative effect on perceived risk and a positive effect on the intention to play an online game.

IoT has become a popular target for attackers seeking sensitive and personal user data, computing infrastructure for massive attacks, or aimed at compromising critical applications. Worryingly, the industrial race toward the forefront of IoT software and device development has led to increased market penetration of vulnerable IoT devices and applications. Nevertheless, traditional cybersecurity solutions designed for personal computers often rely on heavy computation and high communication overhead, and therefore are prohibitive for IoT, given the explosive number of IoT devices, their resource-con-strained nature, and their heterogeneity. Hence, innovative solutions must be designed for securing IoT applications, while considering the peculiar characteristics of IoT devices and networks.

We propose a device-oriented and network-oriented classification and investigate recent works that designed ML-based solutions, considering IoT physical layer features, to secure IoT applications. The proposed classification helps engineers and practitioners starting in this area to better identify and understand the challenges, requirements, and up-to-date common design principles for securing IoT devices and networks considering physical layer features.

They are becoming fully automated environments where energy consumption, access control, heating and many other subsystems are all integrated within a single system commonly referred to as smart building (SB). To support the growing complexity of building operations, building automation systems (BAS) powering SBs are integrating consumer range Internet of things (IoT) devices such as IP cameras alongside with operational technology (OT) controllers and actuators. However, these changes pose important cybersecurity concerns since the attack surface is larger, attack vectors are increasing and attacks can potentially harm building occupants. In this paper, we analyze the threat landscape of BASs by focusing on subsystems which are strongly affected by the advent of IoT devices such as video surveillance systems and smart lightining. We demonstrate how BAS operation can be disrupted by simple attacks to widely used network protocols. Furthermore, using both known and 0-day vulnerabilities reported in the paper and previously disclosed, we present the first (at our knowledge) BAS-specific malware which is able to persist within the BAS network by leveraging both OT and IoT devices connected to the BAS. Our research highlights how BAS networks can be considered as critical as industrial control systems and security concerns in BASs deserve more attention from both industrial and scientific communities.

Given the fast evolution of Android malware releases, it is practically not fea-sible to manually detect malware apps in the Android ecosystem. As a result, machine learning has become a fledgling approach for malware detection. Since machine learning performance is largely influenced by the availability of high quality and relevant features, feature selection approaches play key role in machine learning based detection of malware. In this paper, we formulate the feature selection problem as a quadratic programming problem and analyse how commonly used fil-ter-based feature selection methods work with emphases on Android malware detection. We compare and contrast several feature selection methods along several factors including the composition of relevant features selected. We empirically evaluate the predictive accuracy of the feature subset selection algorithms and compare their predictive accuracy and the execution time using several learning algorithms. The results of the experiments confirm that feature selection is necessary for improving accuracy of the learning models as well decreasing the run time. The results also show that the performance of the feature selection algorithms vary from one learning algorithm to another and no one feature selection approach performs better than the other approaches all the time. © 2021 by the authors.

VeriDevOps focuses on optimizing the security verification activities, by automatically creating verifiable models directly from security requirements formulated in natural language, using these models to check security properties on design models and then generating artefacts such as, tests or monitors that can be used later in the DevOps process. The main drivers for these advances are: Natural Language Processing, a combined formal verification and model-based testing approach, and machine-learning-based security monitors.

Therefore, Ethernet protocol was introduced and vehicle gateway system was newly introduced in vehicle system. The vehicle gateway system provides an interface for continuously connecting and exchanging vehicle data in different communication environments between the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol and the Ethernet network protocol. There are two types of data exchange in the vehicle gateway. These are direct routing and indirect routing. Vehicle gateways are connected to external networks, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. So it needs security function to ensure message integrity. Recently, vehicle manufacturers have introduced gateway systems with security features that operate to verify the integrity of messages using cipher-based message authentication codes (CMAC). But applying security functions to a gateway system introduces delays in performing security functions. Therefore, in this paper, to design stable and efficient the vehicle gateway system with security function, we have tested and evaluated the latency time that can occur according to the routing methods which are direct routing and indirect routing. © 2021, KSAE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099784553

Drones have pros and cons like any other technologies that operate on different communication protocols (i.e., Network, Bluetooth, Satellite, etc.). Recent studies have discussed challenges that may come in tow with the growing use of such technology. These studies note that in-depth examination is required, especially when addressing challenges that carry a high volume of software data between sensors, actuators, and control commands. From a security perspective, the technology has not achieved reliable security measures. This is due to many factors such as different operating systems to operate the drone. Drones run on different hardware and software components, which pose yet another series of challenges in both the drone forensic process and incident response. This paper examines a VTI Phoenix drone by utilizing the 'Purple-Teaming' tactics, presents challenges related to drone forensic discovery and discusses potential drone anti-forensic techniques and their association with the type of use, environment, attack vector, and level of expertise. To this end, we proposed the UAV Kill Chain based on the conducted examination and the presented scientific contribution in this work.

In dealing with this security requirement, the research community focuses on developing new security mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facilitated by leveraging modern machine learning techniques.

In fact, countries have set their own targets and are offering incentives for people to purchase EVs as opposed to traditional gasoline-powered cars. Manufacturers have been hastily deploying charging stations to meet the charging requirements of the EVs on the road. This rapid deployment has contributed to the EV ecosystem's lack of proper security measures. raising multiple questions related to the power grid security and vulnerability. In this paper, we offer a complete examination of the EV ecosystem from the vulnerability to the attacks and finally the solutions. We start by examining the existing vulnerabilities in the EV ecosystem that can be exploited to control the EV charging and launch attacks against the power grid. We then discuss the non-linear nature of the EV charging load and simulate multiple attacks that can be launched against the power grid using these EVs. EV loads have high reactive power demand which can have a larger impact on the grid compared to residential loads. We perform simulations on two power grids and demonstrate that while the grid can recover after a 48 MW attack utilizing traditional residential loads, a smaller 30 MW EV load attack can completely destabilize the system. Finally, we suggest several patches for the existing vulnerabilities and discuss two methods aimed at detecting EV attacks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119627070

Confronting to these issues, electricity systems of the future will be vastly changed, dominated by new technologies and business models, increasingly digital and highly complex. Such transformation will be enabled by means to efficiently, stably and affordably distribute electrical power from many sources and storage points. Market design, policy, regulations, legislations, cyber security and politics are barely keeping up with advances in technologies, and energy technology choices have multi-generational implications for people and economies. These issues are global and to find a solution requires true systems thinking, informed by cutting-edge research. This paper envisages interdisciplinary digitalized future energy systems for emission reductions and proposes a 6-theme template to shape the future energy system. The six research themes have been designed such that the 'whole is greater than the sum of the parts'.

Conventional shallow machine learning-based techniques for DDoS attack classification tend to be ineffective when the volume and features of network traffic, potentially carry malicious DDoS payloads, increase exponentially as they cannot extract high importance features automatically. To address this concern, we propose a hybrid approach named AE-MLP that combines two deep learning-based models for effective DDoS attack detection and classification. The Autoencoder (AE) part of our proposed model provides an effective feature extraction that finds the most relevant feature sets automatically without human intervention (e.g., knowledge of cybersecurity professionals). The Multi-layer Perceptron Network (MLP) part of our proposed model uses the compressed and reduced feature sets produced by the AE as inputs and classifies the attacks into different DDoS attack types to overcome the performance overhead and bias associated with processing large feature sets with noise (i.e., unnecessary feature values). Our experimental results, obtained through comprehensive and extensive experiments on different aspects of performance on the CICDDoS2019 dataset, demonstrate both a very high and robust accuracy rate and F1-score that exceed 98% which also outperformed the performance of many similar methods. This shows that our proposed model can be used as an effective DDoS defense tool against the growing number of DDoS attacks. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118543779

A classical exponential function of breach probability and the intuitive idea of ‘the expected net benefits’, originally presented in 2002 by Gordon and Loeb, were applied to introduce the concept of cybersecurity value. The cybersecurity value of security control is defined as the value gained by implementing a single control to secure a subset of components. The cybersecurity value of a control can be seen as a measure of its efficiency in reducing vulnerability of a secured system or component. A mixed binary optimisation problem, next transformed into an unconstrained binary program is developed to maximise total cybersecurity value of control portfolio. The optimal solution to the binary program provides a simple formula to immediately obtain the portfolio of security controls with maximum total cybersecurity value and determine a rough cut cybersecurity investment. This study also shows that portfolio of security controls with maximum total cybersecurity value reduces the losses from security breaches and mitigate the impact of cyber risk. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118536818

Like previous era-defining technologies, global digital networks have changed state violence. Offensive cyber capabilities (OCCs) appear to constitute a major technological development that offers the potential for reducing state violence. This article asks: are OCCs really the better angels of our digital nature? Current scholarship in strategic studies, adopting a narrow definition of violence, conceives of OCCs as largely non-violent. This ignores how technology has given rise to new forms of harm to individuals and communities, particularly in the context of violent state repression. We propose using an expanded definition of violence, including affective and community harms, and argue that OCCs relocate, rather than reduce, state violence towards non-bodily harms. Even though their lethal effects are limited, OCCs are not, as is supposed, a non-violent addition to state arsenals. This conclusion has important implications for international affairs, including re-orienting defensive cybersecurity efforts and altering calculations around the perception of OCCs by adversaries.

It finds that despite shifting from a nominally defensive to a nominally offensive posture, rather than revise policy categories and priorities, policy makers interpreted cyber threats within existing threat and policy categories. These findings offer two contributions to policy scholarship. First, they begin the process of situating the Trump administration in the larger context of US cybersecurity policy. Second, they demonstrate constraints on senior policy makers as well as the utility of a punctuated equilibrium model.

Focusing on both sport and esports, this study finds the social media factors contributing in the sentiment formation and commenting behavior on Twitter and proposes a scheme for attitude modulation through identification of highly engaged nano-influencers. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental design was used as the research methodology. Data mining from Twitter using RStudio software was conducted using the keyword “cybersecurity” during the time of pandemic. Final corpus of 31,891 tweets were considered for the study. Initial sentiment analysis has been conducted to explore the consumer's emotional inclination towards cybersecurity. Further through generalized equation modeling the impact of social media attributes over the consumer's posting behavior has been analyzed. Findings: The research findings reveal that users are inherently positive towards cybersecurity adoption in sports and the factors such as number of tweets, number of positive words contained in these tweets and the authenticity of the information source boost the pre-established tweeting behavior. However, the influx of information from non-organizational sources such as trending topics and discussions have negative impact over the users.

Threat Intelligence (TI) has become a powerful security technique to understand cyber-attacks using artificial intelligence models that can automatically safeguard SAGS networks. In this paper, we propose a new TI scheme based on deep learning techniques that can discover cyber threats from SAGS networks. The proposed scheme contains three modules: a deep pattern extractor, TI-driven detection and TI-attack type identification technique. The deep pattern extractor module is designed to elicit hidden patterns of IoT networks, and its output used as input to the TI-driven detection. TI-attack type identification is used to identify the attack types of malicious patterns to assist in responding to security incidents.

This has led to a spike in the number of cybersecurity problems over the years, the most notable of which is the phishing attack, in which malicious websites imitate legitimate websites to capture gullible users’ details needed for unauthorized access. However, current mitigation strategies, such as anti-phishing applications and Machine Learning (ML) methods, have been effective for detecting phishing activities. Hackers, on the other hand, are developing new ways to circumvent these countermeasures. Nevertheless, given the dynamism of phishing attempts, there is a continual demand for innovative and efficient solutions for website phishing detection. This study proposes a Rotation Forest-based Logistic Model Trees (RF-LMT) for website phishing detection. LMT is a technique that combines logistic regression and tree inference into a single model tree. Three datasets of different instance distributions, both balanced and imbalanced, are used to investigate the proposed RF-LMT. From the results, it was observed that LMT performed better than the selected baseline classifiers. This finding revealed that LMT can perform comparably to baseline classifiers. However, in comparison to LMT and experimented baseline classifiers, the proposed RF-LMT method showed superior performance in website phishing detection. Specifically, RF-LMT had a high detection accuracy (98.24%), AUC (0.998), f-measure (0.982) values with a low false-positive rate (0.018). Furthermore, RF-LMT outperformed existing ML-based phishing attack models. As a result, the proposed RF-LMT method is recommended for dealing with complex phishing attacks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115734235

Indeed, these connected objects increase the efficiency, flexibility and autonomy of machines, thus improving the productivity and profitability of factories. However, the opening up of digitization technologies, especially in environments where failure is hardly tolerable, creates new challenges related to security. The number of vulnerabilities in industrial facilities is constantly increasing [1]. To implement a cyber defense framework for industrial systems, the cybersecurity standard IEC 62443 has been proposed. This standard mainly provides a set of instructions and measures to be put in place to ensure not only the security of the industrial system, but also operational safety. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the standards IEC 62443-3-2 and IEC 62443-4-2 allowing us to verify, through an in-depth risk assessment, the conformity of the objects with the main security requirements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Industry 4.0 is a concept aimed at achieving the integration of physical and cybernetic parts of the manufacturing process via networks and driven by Industry 4.0 technology categories used for the prediction, control, maintenance, and integration of manufacturing processes (i.e., cyberphysical systems, Internet of Things, big data analytics, cloud computing, fog and edge computing, augmented and virtual reality, robotics, cybersecurity, semantic web technologies, and additive manufacturing). The research on implementing Industry 4.0 is lagging behind the degree of attention Industry 4.0 attracts. Moreover, contrary to the exponential growth that Industry 4.0 research shows, the implementation of Industry 4.0 in practice is less often covered in the relevant literature. The challenges of implementing Industry 4.0 are even less frequently addressed. Industry 4.0 implementation challenges can be either managerial or technological. In our recent paper, we analyzed managerial implementation challenges. This article, as a continuation of our previous work, identifies, codes, and defines the technological Industry 4.0 implementation challenges. It further analyzes hindering relationships between Industry 4.0 technologies and identifies main challenge themes important for system designers.

With the massive number of connected devices, opportunities for potential network attacks are nearly unlimited. An additional problem is that many low-cost devices are not equipped with effective security protection so that they are easily hacked and applied within a network of bots (botnet) to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) based on deep learning that aims to identify suspicious behavior in modern heterogeneous information systems. The proposed approach is based on a deep recurrent autoencoder that learns time series of normal network behavior and detects notable network anomalies. An additional feature of the proposed IDS is that it is trained with an optimized dataset, where the number of features is reduced by 94% without classification accuracy loss. Thus, the proposed IDS remains stable in response to slight system perturbations, which do not represent network anomalies. The proposed approach is evaluated under different simulation scenarios and provides a 99% detection accuracy over known datasets while reducing the training time by an order of magnitude. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Because conspiracy theories often contain a kernel of truth and feature a strong adversarial “other,” they serve as the perfect vehicle for maligned actors to use in influence campaigns. To explore the importance of conspiracies in the spread of dis-/mis-information, we propose the usage of state-of-the-art, tuned language models to classify tweets as conspiratorial or not. This model is based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model developed by Google researchers. The classification method expedites analysis by automating a process that is currently done manually (identifying tweets that promote conspiracy theories). We identified COVID-19 origin conspiracy theory tweets using this method and then used social cybersecurity methods to analyze communities, spreaders, and characteristics of the different origin-related conspiracy theory narratives. We found that tweets about conspiracy theories were supported by news sites with low fact-checking scores and amplified by bots who were more likely to link to prominent Twitter users than in non-conspiracy tweets. We also found different patterns in conspiracy vs. non-conspiracy conversations in terms of hashtag usage, identity, and country of origin. This analysis shows how we can better understand who spreads conspiracy theories and how they are spreading them. © The Author(s) 2021.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114381630

The increase of Internet-connected devices has caused attackers to focus their attention more on these devices. Therefore, new and more sophisticated attacks on IoT systems are discovered every day. Currently, to ensure reliability and operability, most IoT systems are designed to operate in a relatively static configuration in a highly heterogeneous environment. However, a system that does not continuously change its configurations, i.e., a static system, gives an advantage to attackers; with enough time and resources, an attacker will eventually find and exploit the vulnerabilities of any static target. This work proposes a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy that randomly shuffles the communication protocols through which a node communicates to a gateway in an IoT network. The system's configuration changes have an associated cost. The objective of the proposed MTD strategy in this work is to balance the increase in system performance overhead, the increase in business impact (system unavailability), and, at the same time, the decrease in the probability of success of a given attack. A framework is proposed to design this strategy; this framework can guide any MTD strategy for IoT systems. The framework's objective is to find, after several iterations, the MTD strategy parameters that achieve a balance between five different measurable variables of an IoT system. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113823734

Recently, the application of machine learning in NIDS helps alleviate the enormous effort of human observation. Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning scheme concerning distributed data. Instead of sharing raw data, it allows a participant to share only a trained local model. Despite the success of existing FL solutions, in NIDS, a network's traffic data distribution does not always fit into the single global model of FL; some networks have similarities with each other but other networks do not. We propose Segmented-Federated Learning (Segmented-FL), where by employing periodic local model evaluation and network segmentation, we aim to bring similar network environments to the same group. A comparison between FL and our method was conducted against a range of metrics including the weighted precision, recall, and F1 score, using a collected dataset from 20 massively distributed networks within 60 days. By studying the optimized hyperparameters of Segmented-FL and employing three evaluation methods, it shows that Segmented-FL has better performance in all three types of intrusion detection tasks, achieving validation weighted F1 scores of 0.964, 0.803, and 0.912 with Method A, Method B, and Method C respectively.

The emergent cyber resilience management integrates cyber risk management (which is based on identifying, analyzing and mitigating risk of cyber-attacks) with the ability to front them, recover from them and adapt the organization to the new situation when unpredictable attacks occur, without regressing. Several guidelines have been developed to guide organizations in managing cyber resilience, the NIST framework suggested and organized IT and managerial practices among different reference cyber security standards offering a practical overview followed by companies all over the world.

However, the traditional Centralized DL (CDL) method cannot be used to detect previously unknown (zero-day) botnet attack without breaching the data privacy rights of the users. In this paper, we propose Federated Deep Learning (FDL) method for zero-day botnet attack detection to avoid data privacy leakage in IoT edge devices. In this method, an optimal Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture is employed for network traffic classification. A model parameter server remotely coordinates the independent training of the DNN models in multiple IoT edge devices, while Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm is used to aggregate local model updates. A global DNN model is produced after a number of communication rounds between the model parameter server and the IoT edge devices. Zero-day botnet attack scenarios in IoT edge devices is simulated with the Bot-IoT and N-BaIoT data sets. Experiment results show that FDL model: (a) detects zero-day botnet attacks with high classification performance; (b) guarantees data privacy and security; (c) has low communication overhead (d) requires low memory space for the storage of training data; and (e) has low network latency.

This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of operations but also introduces new cybersecurity challenges. In this article, the impact assessment methodology is applied in the context of manufacturing systems 4.0 (also known as smart manufacturing systems, cyber manufacturing systems, or digital manufacturing systems), thus identifying the critical assets to be protected against cyber-attacks and assessing the business impacts in the case of subtractive and additive technologies. The research design of the single case study with multiple units of analysis is applied. In particular, a large company, a leader in the manufacturing of aeronautical components, is considered a representative case study, and its two main types of manufacturing cells that is, those based on networked computer numerical control machines and 3-D printers, are taken as applicative cases for the methodology. The application of the impact assessment methodology in the manufacturing context 4.0 of aeronautical components represents a useful guide for researchers in the field of cybersecurity and for companies intending to implement it in their smart manufacturing environments. In particular, based on this study, companies can define the critical manufacturing data to protect against cyber-attacks, isolate the business impacts in case of cybersecurity breaches, correlate the identified business impacts with the specific data category, and assess the level of business impacts.

They are easy to compromise and, as they are connected on a large scale with high-value data content, the compromise of any single device can extend to the whole system and disrupt critical functions. There are various security solutions that detect and mitigate intrusions. However, as they lack the capability to deal with an IIoT&#x2019;s co-existing heterogeneity and interoperability, developing new universal security solutions to fit its requirements is critical. This is challenging due to the scarcity of accurate data about IIoT systems&#x2019; activities, connectivities and attack behaviors. In addition, owing to their multi-platform connectivity protocols and multi-vendor devices, collecting and creating such data is also challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a holistic approach for generating an appropriate intrusion dataset for an IIoT called X-IIoTID, connectivity-and device-agnostic intrusion dataset for fitting the heterogeneity and interoperability of IIoT systems. It includes the behaviors of new IIoT connectivity protocols, activities of recent devices, diverse attack types and scenarios, and various attack protocols. It defines an attack taxonomy and consists of multi-view features, such as network traffic, host resources, logs and alerts. X-IIoTID is evaluated using popular machine and deep learning algorithms and compared with eighteen intrusion datasets to verify its novelty.

The least significant bit (LSB) method consists in replacing the last bit of each byte and can do it in several bytes at the same time and the image will not have a noticeable change. Each substituted bit is part of a letter of the message that you want to hide in the given image. In general, images with PGM extension are very useful to apply the technique (LSB) since they are images whose content is given without following some algorithm of compression; This means that the content of the file is more readable and easy to work since it is in the ascci format (US standard code for information exchange). The content of an image with PGM extension, can be visualized using a simple text editor, so that the ASCII information can be seen as a representation of whole numbers, the value of these numbers will represent the intensity of color, 255 is white and 0 is black. If each row of the matrix represents an image data and every last digit, which is the least significant bit, is altered, then the eight bits corresponding to each altered byte would represent a letter belonging to a hidden message word. If this sequence is repeated several times you can hide more information such as phrases or sentences. Steganography is a useful tool in the field of computer security where it is required to verify that private information is correctly used by the user determined using the encryption in the personal key. There are already several software products that are responsible for carrying out this process, one of these cases is OpenStego, which encrypts the information using steganography and through passwords ensures that only the bearer of it will be able to visualize said information. We will show that the use of the Fortran, MatLab programming language presents great advantages for steganography since access to memory spaces through pointers allows freeing up memory at runtime, which provides a high degree of efficiency in the execution of a Program. Fortran, being a programming language oriented to mathematical calculation in general, has tools that facilitate its application and expressly the matrix calculation used in steganography. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112301949

These present a difficult challenge in that the most well-designed cybersecurity apparatus is vulnerable to those inside the organization who have privileged access to information systems. Innovative methods must be developed to help security analysts narrow the large pool of potential ITs in large organizations to a more manageable number. The purpose of this article is to develop and validate eye-tracking metrics that are diagnostic of IT behavior. Key stimuli, or called active indicator probes, were embedded into a simulated workflow to elicit diagnostic eye-tracking responses. Two environments were simulated: financial and intelligence analysis. We evaluated participants performing as regular workers relative to ITs to identify metrics that distinguished between the two groups. Detection of illicit eye gaze behavior while using chat programs was possible when conversations with accomplices occurred in a separate chat window from normal permissible chat conversations. Validation of results in real work environments is necessary for practical application. However, if the approach proves to translate successfully, automated monitoring of eye-tracking responses may augment existing insider detection methods, within frameworks for best practices in organizational security and cyber defense.

Traditional IT security-biased protection methods that focus on improving cyber hygiene are largely impotent in the face of targeted attacks by advanced cyber-adversaries. Thus, there is an urgent need to analyze the safety and security of critical infrastructure in a holistic fashion, leveraging the physics of the cyber-physical system. System-Theoretic Accident Model &amp; Processes (STAMP) offers a powerful framework to analyze complex systems; hitherto, STAMP has been used extensively to perform safety analyses but an integrated safety and cybersecurity analysis of industrial control systems (ICS) has not been published. This paper uses the electrical generation and distribution system of an archetypal industrial facility to demonstrate the application of a STAMP-based method called Cybersafety to identify and mitigate cyber- vulnerabilities in ICS. The key contribution of this work is to differentiate the additional steps required to perform a holistic cybersecurity analysis for an ICS of significant size and complexity and to present the analysis in a structured format that can be emulated for larger systems with many interdependent subsystems.

The proposed method involves two new schemes, one is for dynamically detecting the cyberattack, and the other isolates the location of the attack. These schemes are based on dynamic observers designs that can eliminate the effects of unknown inputs.

We concentrate on this issue in online social networks (OSNs) where users usually have composite behavioral records, consisting of multidimensional low-quality data, e.g., offline check-ins and online user-generated content (UGC). As an insightful result, we validate that there is a complementary effect among different dimensions of records for modeling users' behavioral patterns. To deeply exploit such a complementary effect, we propose a joint (instead of fused) model to capture both online and offline features of a user's composite behavior. We evaluate the proposed joint model by comparing it with typical models and their fused model on two real-world datasets: Foursquare and Yelp. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing ones, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values 0.956 in Foursquare and 0.947 in Yelp, respectively.

Security in supply chain is challenging due to the inherent vulnerabilities and threats from any part of the system which can be exploited at any point within the supply chain. This can cause a severe disruption on the overall business continuity. Therefore, it is paramount important to understand and predicate the threats so that organization can undertake necessary control measures for the supply chain security. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides an intelligence analysis to discover unknown to known threats using various properties including threat actor skill and motivation, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure (TT and P), and Indicator of Compromise (IoC). This paper aims to analyse and predicate threats to improve cyber supply chain security. We have applied Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyse and predict the threats based on the CTI properties. That allows to identify the inherent CSC vulnerabilities so that appropriate control actions can be undertaken for the overall cybersecurity improvement. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, CTI data is gathered and a number of ML algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression (LG), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), are used to develop predictive analytics using the Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset. The experiment considers attack and TTP as input parameters and vulnerabilities and Indicators of compromise (IoC) as output parameters. The results relating to the prediction reveal that Spyware/Ransomware and spear phishing are the most predictable threats in CSC. We have also recommended relevant controls to tackle these threats.

The concept of building security systems based on a variety of models describing various CIF functioning aspects is presented. The development of the concept is presented as a sequence of solving the following tasks. The basic concepts related to cyberattacks on CIF were determined, which make it possible to outline the boundaries of the problem and determine the level of formalization of the modeling processes. The proposed threat model takes into account possible synergistic/emergent features of the integration of modern target threats and their hybridity. A unified threat base that does not depend on CIF was formed. The concept of modeling the CIF security system was developed based on models of various classes and levels. A method to determine attacker's capabilities was developed. A concept for assessing the CIF security was developed, which allows forming a unified threat base, assessing the signs of their synergy and hybridity, identifying critical CIF points, determining compliance with regulatory requirements and the state of the security system. The mathematical tool and a variety of basic models of the concept can be used for all CIFs, which makes it possible to unify preventive measures and increase the security level. It is proposed to use post-quantum cryptography algorithms on crypto-code structures to provide security services. The proposed mechanisms provide the required stability (230–235 group operations), the rate of cryptographic transformation is comparable to block-symmetric ciphers (BSC) and reliability (Perr 10–9–10–12) Copyright © 2021, Authors.

So, cybersecurity strives to make networks as safe as possible, by introducing defense systems to detect any suspicious activities. However, firewalls and classical intrusion detection systems (IDSs) suffer from continuous updating of their defined databases to detect threats. The new directions of the IDSs aim to leverage the machine learning models to design more robust systems with higher detection rates and lower false alarm rates. This research presents a novel network IDS, which plays an important role in network security and faces the current cyberattacks on networks using the UNSW-NB15 dataset benchmark. Our proposed system is a dynamically scalable multiclass machine learning-based network IDS. It consists of several stages based on supervised machine learning. It starts with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) method to solve the imbalanced classes problem in the dataset and then selects the important features for each class existing in the dataset by the Gini Impurity criterion using the Extremely Randomized Trees Classifier (Extra Trees Classifier). After that, a pretrained extreme learning machine (ELM) model is responsible for detecting the attacks separately, ""One-Versus-All""as a binary classifier for each of them. Finally, the ELM classifier outputs become the inputs to a fully connected layer in order to learn from all their combinations, followed by a logistic regression layer to make soft decisions for all classes. Results show that our proposed system performs better than related works in terms of accuracy, false alarm rate, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Precision-Recall Curves (PRCs). © 2021 Soulaiman Moualla et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108944875

However, their socio-economic and environmental benefits can be hampered by new technological risks emerging from their use. This chapter explores some of the major risks associated with AV adoption that need to be addressed to reap the technology’s full benefits. AVs can introduce safety risks arising from technical issues in the AV system and ethical issues in their design and deployment. In addition, socio-economic equity is a key aspect of sustainability, which can be undermined by AVs displacing jobs in existing industries, as well as by their discriminatory driving decisions shaped by algorithmic biases and the value-laden design choices of AV stakeholders. AVs’ connected nature also poses privacy and cybersecurity risks that can dampen consumer acceptance.

The sharing of data is very important for enhancing vehicular services, but at the same time makes IoV vulnerable for security and privacy issues. The smart and interconnected vehicles produce sophisticated services for transport authorities, car manufacturers, vehicle owners, and other service providers. IoV are very vulnerable to malicious attacks due to its self-organizing nature and the open source nature of its implementations. This exposes the smart and interconnected vehicles to a variety of privacy and security threats, such as a remote hijacking or location tracking of vehicles. Thus, the security for IoV environment is critical. Blockchain technology has been recently used for cybersecurity due to the robustness and integrity preserving nature of its design. This review article provides a detailed survey of existing work in the literature to secure IoV through blockchain techniques such as security, privacy, reputation, distributed, decentralized, data sharing, authentication, and trust-based approaches. The paper presents the detailed discussion and analysis of these blockchain techniques to secure IoV.

Characteristic of the contemporary realm of intelligent malware classification is the threat of adversarial ML. Adversaries are looking to target the underlying data and/or models responsible for the functionality of malware classification to map its behavior or corrupt its functionality. The ends of such adversaries are bypassing the cybersecurity measures and increasing malware effectiveness. We develop an adversarial training based ML approach for malware classification under adversarial conditions that leverages a stacking ensemble method, which compares the performance of 10 base ML models when adversarially trained on three data sets of varying data perturbation schemes. This comparison ultimately reveals the best performing model per data set, which includes random forest, bagging and gradient boosting. Experimentation also includes stacking a mixture of ML models in both the first and second levels in the stack. A first level stack across all 10 ML models with a second level support vector machine is top performing.

In this context, the implementation of AI observatory endeavors represents one key research direction. This paper motivates the need for an inherently transdisciplinary AI observatory approach integrating diverse retrospective and counterfactual views. We delineate aims and limitations while providing hands-on-advice utilizing concrete practical examples. Distinguishing between unintentionally and intentionally triggered AI risks with diverse socio-psycho-technological impacts, we exemplify a retrospective descriptive analysis followed by a retrospective counterfactual risk analysis. Building on these AI observatory tools, we present near-term transdisciplinary guidelines for AI safety. As further contribution, we discuss differentiated and tailored long-term directions through the lens of two disparate modern AI safety paradigms. For simplicity, we refer to these two different paradigms with the terms artificial stupidity (AS) and eternal creativity (EC) respectively. While both AS and EC acknowledge the need for a hybrid cognitive-affective approach to AI safety and overlap with regard to many short-term considerations, they differ fundamentally in the nature of multiple envisaged long-term solution patterns.

This paper presents a holistic/Human Factors (HF) approach, where the individual, organisational and technological factors are investigated in pilot healthcare organisations to show how HF vulnerabilities may impact on cybersecurity risks. An overview of current challenges in relation to cybersecurity is first provided, followed by the presentation of an integrated top–down and bottom–up methodology using qualitative and quantitative research methods to assess the level of maturity of the pilot organisations with respect to their capability to face and tackle cyber threats and attacks.

Enterprises must manage the cybersecurity risks so that the security and resilience of their assets may be improved. Cyberattacks on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are rising. However, they often lack effective strategies to prevent threats such as malware, phishing, denial of service (DoS), and others. Their weak defense system is often an attractive avenue for hackers to explore loopholes. There is a lack of cybersecurity initiatives in SMEs, and several past attacks have exposed the weak systems. This paper first attempts to investigate the current scenario of cybersecurity in the context of Middle East SMEs. A survey of SMEs in the Middle East (cybersecurity space) helped understand the existing scenario, actual requirements, and challenges SMEs face. The research then explores the need for SMEs to choose the apt security solution to cater to their business needs. By reviewing the existing standards and pointers in different parts of the world, this research proposes a cybersecurity recommender system for SMEs in the Middle East. One of the survey findings reveals that most SMEs require adequate cybersecurity awareness, followed by evaluating the organization's preventive capabilities. The dearth of information available online and the IT consultants' conflicting guidance usually creates an information overload in deciding a neutral solution to address their needs. The recommender system attempts to structure the information available as a framework in deciding a cybersecurity solution for SMEs. © 2021. River Publishers.

We introduce a new terahertz testing method for non-destructive and unobtrusive identification of counterfeit, damaged, forged or defective ICs by measuring their response to incident terahertz and sub-terahertz radiation at the circuit pins and analyzing the response using artificial intelligence (AI). These responses create unique signatures for ICs. We generated 2D images by measuring the response on a selected pin of a radio frequency IC (RFIC) scanned by a focused terahertz radiation. By applying the data augmentation processes, we created a secure image data set to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

This paper presents a review of the vulnerabilities on wireless technologies that gives connectivity to IoT, and the experiences using Software Defined Radio SDR for implementing wireless attacks to IoT technologies are assessed. A systematic literature review was conducted. The types of vulnerabilities and attacks that can affect the wireless technologies that stand the IoT ecosystem and SDR platforms were compared, and recent methods to overcome these attacks were identified. On the IoT reference model, the perception layer was identified as the most vulnerable. Most attacks at this level occur due to hardware limitations, physical device exposure, and heterogeneity of technologies. Future cybersecurity systems based on SDR technologies have notable advantages due to their flexibility and adaptability to new communication technologies and their potential to develop advanced tools. However, the IoT's cybersecurity challenges are so complex that merging SDR hardware with cognitive and intelligent techniques is highly advisable.

This has led to an uprise of digital presence, which many hypothesize has lead to a rise of cybersecurity attacks, including cyberbullying. To evaluate the significance of COVID-19 on cyberbullying reports, we collected 454, 046 of publicly available tweets from Twitter by using MongoDB and Python libraries from January 1st, 2020-June 7th, 2020. We performed statistical analyses on the collected sample set to understand the situation from a quantitative perspective. We extracted tweets related to 27 unique keywords specific to cyberbullying, including online bullying, cyberbullying, Twitter bullying, and others. Due to the time-series' count nature, we propose a Bayesian estimation of this count data trends utilizing an autoregressive Poisson model. A simple change-point model fails to explain the subtle changes adequately. On the other hand, our Bayesian method clearly shows the upward trend beginning in mid-March, which is reportedly the time from which the stay-at-home orders were widespread globally. The pattern remains similar if we focus on one or more such keywords instead of the total count. We also provide a fine-grained lag based analysis of our model and contrast our methods with an alternative semi-Bayesian AR-ARCH model.

This type of cybersecurity threat requires minimal technical knowledge because it relies on the organization’s human element. Social engineers use various techniques, such as phishing, to manipulate users into either granting them access to various systems or disclosing their private data and information. Social engineering attacks can cost organizations more than 100,000 USD per instance. Therefore, it is necessary for organizations to increase their users’ awareness of social engineering attacks to mitigate the problem. The aim of this study is to provide a measurement of social engineering awareness in the Saudi educational sector. To achieve the aim of this study, a questionnaire was developed and evaluated. A total of 465 respondents completed the survey and answered questions related to measuring their knowledge of social engineering. The results show that 34% of participants (158 participants) had previous knowledge of social engineering approaches.

This article investigates the increasing prominence of deterrence in the practice of cyber diplomacy in the Asia Pacific. Using Japan and Australia as case studies, it argues that both states continue to adhere to the conceptual tenets of cyber diplomacy, however, in practice, there is a growing integration of deterrence—cyber capabilities and public attribution/naming and shaming—in the equation at varying degrees and intensities. The article endeavours to make two important contributions: First, revitalize the existing cyber diplomacy framework by challenging the extant literature’s view of deterrence’s limited application—underpinned by cold war analogies—and the implausibility of conducting attribution of cyberattacks. Secondly, evaluate Japan and Australia’s cyber diplomacy based on empirical evidence. Key findings suggest that deterrence reinforces/complements the fundamental elements present in the cyber diplomacy playbook.

Generally, CPSs authorize critical infrastructures and are considered to be important in the daily lives of humans because they formthe basis of future smart devices. Increased utilization of CPSs, however, poses many threats, which may be of major significance for users. Such security issues in CPSs represent a global issue; therefore, developing a robust, secure, and effective CPS is currently a hot research topic. To resolve this issue, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can be designed to protect CPSs.When the IDS detects an anomaly, it instantly takes the necessary actions to avoid harming the system. In this study,we introduce a newparameter-tuned deep-stacked autoencoder based on deep learning (DL), called PT-DSAE, for the IDS in CPSs. The proposed model involves preprocessing, feature extraction, parameter tuning, and classification. First, data preprocessing takes place to eliminate the noise present in the data. Next, a DL-basedDSAEmodel is applied to detect anomalies in the CPS. In addition, hyperparameter tuning of the DSAE takes place using a search-and-rescue optimization algorithm to tune the parameters of the DSAE, such as the number of hidden layers, batch size, epoch count, and learning rate. To assess the experimental outcomes of the PT-DSAE model, a series of experiments were performed using data from a sensor-based CPS. Moreover, a detailed comparative analysis was performed to ensure the effective detection outcome of the PT-DSAE technique. The experimental results obtained verified the superior performance on the applied data over the compared methods. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

At present, surface web and dark web contain numerous underground forums or markets, which play an important role in cybercrime ecosystem. Therefore, cybersecurity researchers usually focus on hacker-centered research on cybercrime, trying to find key hackers and extract credible cyber threat intelligence from them. The data scale of underground forums is tremendous and key hackers only represent a small fraction of underground forum users. It takes a lot of time as well as expertise to manually analyze key hackers. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a method or tool to automatically analyze underground forums and identify key hackers involved. In this work, we present HackerRank, an automatic method for identifying key hackers. HackerRank combines the advantages of content analysis and social network analysis. First, comprehensive evaluations and topic preferences are extracted separately using content analysis. Then, it uses an improved Topic-specific PageRank to combine the results of content analysis with social network analysis. Finally, HackerRank obtains users’ ranking, with higher-ranked users being considered as key hackers. To demonstrate the validity of proposed method, we applied HackerRank to five different underground forums separately. Compared to using social network analysis and content analysis alone, HackerRank increases the coverage rate of five underground forums by 3.14% and 16.19% on average. In addition, we performed a manual analysis of identified key hackers. The results prove that the method is effective in identifying key hackers in underground forums. © The Author(s) 2021.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105530510

There has been a tremendous increase in the generation, usage and consumption of industrial and business data as a result of smart and computational intensive software systems. This has resulted in an increase in the attack surface of these cyber systems. Consequently, there has been a consequent increase in the associated cybersecurity risks. However, no significant studies have been conducted that examine, compare, and evaluate the approaches used by the risk calculators to investigate the data breaches. The development of an efficient cybersecurity solution allows us to mitigate the data breaches threatened by the cybersecurity risks such as cyber-attacks against database storage, processing and management.

The data used in this model are taken from the industrial business report, which provides the necessary information collected and the calculators developed by the major organizations in the field. This model integrated with the cybersecurity solution uses consolidated factors that have a significant impact on the data breach risk. We propose mathematical models of how the factors impact the cost and the likelihood.

The process of creating, distributing, storing, deploying, and finally revoking the cryptographic keys is called key management. On the basis of the structure, usability, and complexity of the cyber-physical systems, each one of the current key management practices is suitable for a specific range of applications. However, these schemes have some drawbacks in common, such as complicated key generation and distribution process, using key storage, attacks, and traffic load. This paper proposes a key management model for establishing secure communications in the distributed industrial intelligent systems. The model is attack resistant, has high usability in real-world applications, and transforms the current customary key management workflow to enhance security and reduce weaknesses. Its main features include reduced process, intelligent attack resistance, producing dynamic keys with no additional cost, and eliminating key storage and revocation calls. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104847854

The Healthcare industry, been one of the largest industry has been facing a lot of cyber-attacks challenges ranging from malware attacks, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and so on thereby leading to identity theft, data manipulation from an unauthorized entity. Electronic healthcare records are sensitive information that contains patient's personal information like name medication histories, lab reports, payment details, contact and home address which have to be shared among healthcare providers need to be efficiently secured from attacks. But the standard cybersecurity platform which is currently used by the healthcare industry to preserve information has a lot of flaws thereby rendering medical records venerable to cyber-attack. To address this problem there is a need to change the standard cybersecurity platform on the healthcare industry to blockchain-based security, which is one of the best solutions to cyber-attacks.

It enables employees to use their personally owned devices to perform business activities, leading to increased productivity and employee satisfaction. However, BYOD also brought associated risks because of exponential growth in the number of cybersecurity incidents due to which business ecosystem gets disrupted and fragmented. Although several methods and mechanisms have been developed and adopted to mitigate the risk associated with BYOD, they still represent a challenge as corporate network gets exposed to inherent threats caused by the BYOD threat landscape. This work demonstrates especially two key aspects: The first focuses on how to detect and protect BYOD environment from an advanced level attack which cannot be detected by traditional tools and techniques even though available tools are quite effective. Before the attack and damage to the critical infrastructure due to BYOD threat, a strategy was indeed the key requirement for detecting attacks and protecting the environment. The second part of the research focuses on conducting forensic investigation model and developing a new approach by providing a reliable forensic investigation infrastructure to find digital evidence and detect the source of attack. This research work concluded with two different novel strategic ideas. The first part contributes to a new method of detecting and protecting against malicious activities which cannot be otherwise detected and protected by traditional security technology like IPS, IDS, AntiBot, or AntiVirus. The proposed technique compared to the existing methods led to a significant contribution to the identification of threats before an attack takes place. The second part of the research contributes to the defining of a new approach of the next-generation digital forensic readiness (NG-DFR) model in order to build a cyber forensic ecosystem so that cyber secured BYOD environment can be enabled safely.

More importantly, recent policy reports and curricula initiatives appear to recommended formal methods in the limited context of “safety critical applications”; we suggest this is too limited in scope and ambition.

SBAS systems exploits satellite transmission from the geostationary orbit and they broadcast corrections and integrity data for GNSS constellations such as GPS. The SBAS data allows prompt reaction to GNSS malfunction and improve the overall navigation accuracy thus allowing aeronautic receivers to compute a protection level, bounding the residual position error with the required level of confidence. SBAS signals are broadcast from the GEO orbit and designed to be received on ground surface with a strength comparable to those of GNSS signals. This guarantees the compatibility at receiver level, however the very low power (e.g. around -158 dBW) makes signals weak against interference: replication, potential malicious alteration or forging can be easily achieved. In particular, the broadcast of non-authentic SBAS data messages can have a detrimental impact on receiver operations, because the navigation solution could be affected even if the received GNSS signal is not spoofed. The European Commission is exploring the possibility of improving the resilience of the SBAS service against cybersecurity threats through the authentication of SBAS messages broadcast by the GEO satellites. This would enable receivers to verify that the received SBAS messages are authentic and not altered. With this objective, the EC is financing the SPARC (Simulation Platform for Authentication Reliable Concept) project to identify viable solutions for the authentication of SBAS data. This paper presents four authentication solutions viable to protect the SBAS data service, developed in the SPARC project. The solutions consider the DFMC SBAS service still under definition, and protect the SBAS L5 data. One of them is designed to broadcast messages within the standard data stream, with a clear impact on the available bandwidth and the overall performance. The others exploit a quadrature channel, not currently available, providing higher bandwidth at a cost of a higher power to be transmitted by the SBAS payload. In this paper, the performance indicators of the solutions are presented considering the nominal AWGN conditions compared with a reference case, which is the standards service without authentication. This approach has been specifically chosen in order to measure the impact on the SBAS service itself. Additionally, a performance assessment under spoofing attack have been done and the detection and false-alarm rejection capabilities are reported. © 2021 ION 2021 International Technical Meeting Proceedings.

Background: Phishing emails are a paramount cybersecurity threat for the modern email user. Research attempting to understand how users are susceptible to phishing attacks has been limited and has not fully explored how task factors (e.g., prevalence, email load) influence accurate detection. Method: In three experiments, participants classified emails as either legitimate or not legitimate and reported on a variety of other categorizations. The first two experiments examined how email load and phishing prevalence influence phishing detection independently. The third experiment examined the interaction of these two factors to determine whether they have compounding effects. All three experiments utilized individual difference variables to examine how cognitive, behavioral, and personality factors may influence classifications. Results: Experiment 1 suggests that high email load can make the task appear more challenging. Experiment 2 indicates that low phishing prevalence can decrease sensitivity for phishing emails. Experiment 3 demonstrates that high levels of email load can decrease classification accuracy under 50/50 prevalence rates. Notably, performance was poor across all experiments, with phishing detection near chance levels and low discriminability for emails. Participants demonstrated poor metacognition with over confidence, low self-reported difficulty, and low perceived threat for the emails. Conclusion: Overall, the present studies suggest that high email load and low phishing prevalence can influence email classifications. Application: Organizations and researchers should consider the influences of both email load and phishing prevalence when implementing phishing interventions. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104150527

Ineffective cybersecurity measures pose serious threats and risks to the development and stability of information societies in the world. Hence, different doctrines and thesis have been suggested to explore how this domain should be treated by the public and private stakeholders. Cybersecurity as a public good is one of these doctrines that accordingly, cybersecurity is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. In this paper, we present a model of social preferences reflecting the concepts of altruism, individualism, aggressiveness, and reciprocity. It describes an agent-based model simulating a repeated public goods game among a set of defenders that are in an uncertain environment with incomplete and imperfect information. In the model, defenders have a probability to choose contribution or being a free-rider, depending on their own preferences and facing with revealed preferences of other defenders. This model implements a utility maximization that applies to each individual, modeling the existence of free-riders, punishments, and interdependency of decisions on the social context. The results of this simulation show that, over time, defenders update their preferences in reaction to the behavior of other defenders and the experience of cyber-attacks. Moreover, they indicate a high level of contribution to the provision of cybersecurity as a public good and the effectiveness of punishment on increasing the contributions. This paper demonstrated how agent-based models can be used to examine this doctrine and investigate whether this doctrine complies with the unique characteristics of cybersecurity. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

There are three areas in which auditors might help improve information quality: (1) non-GAAP earnings; (2) ESG reporting; and (3) cybersecurity risks disclosures.

So far, attackers try to generate malicious activities in a network to put down several system services or steal some information from the databases. More recent designs of security components use predictive modeling approach to detect such kind of attacks. Thus, the new target for the attackers is machine learning algorithm itself. Previous studies in cybersecurity have almost exclusively focused on attack detection in a network. Another promising line of attack detection research would be machine learning algorithm protection. There are some attacks against deep learning models in the literature, including fast-gradient sign method (FGSM) attack. This attack is the purest form of the gradient-based evading technique that is used by attackers to evade the classification model.

Implications were considered in regard to cybersecurity awareness training motivation and perceptions of need for protective cybersecurity behavior in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach: A single-shot regression-based study used ordinal regression supported by K-means clustering to evaluate the moderating effects of gender on predictors of technology threat avoidance motivation and behavior on a sample of n = 206 US adult workers. Findings: The regression model explained 47.5% of variance in avoidance motivation and 39% of avoidance behavior variance. Gender moderated predictive associations between several independent variables and avoidance motivation: perceived susceptibility, perceived effectiveness, perceived cost and self-efficacy. Gender also moderated the association between avoidance motivation and avoidance behavior. Research limitations/implications: The predictive impact of gender extends beyond the main effects in technology threat avoidance. Data frequency distributions and inter-variable relationships should be routinely considered in threat avoidance studies, especially if sample variables exhibit non-normal frequency distributions and nonlinear associations. Practical implications: Gender was significantly associated with threat avoidance motivation and avoidance behavior and exhibited notable associations with antecedents of avoidance motivation. Related insights can inform the design and delivery of training content relating to technology threat avoidance as organizations strive to more effectively leverage information technology end-users as protective assets for the enterprise. Originality/value: The uniqueness of this study derives from its focus and findings regarding the moderating effects of gender on technology threat avoidance factors and techniques used to measure and evaluate the associations between them. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103396035

Recently a few ransomware attackers have gone beyond simply encrypting files and waiting for ransom. They threaten to release the data if the victims refuse their ransom request. In this paper, we propose a hypothetical new revenue model for the ransomware, i.e., selling the stolen data rather than publishing the data for free. Through a game-theoretical analysis between attackers and victims, we contribute a novel model to understand the critical decision variables for the proposed data-selling ransomware (which we refer as “ransomware 2.0”) that sells data as well as demands ransom. We compare the role of reputation and the profitability of the data-selling ransomware with traditional ransomware (“ransomware 1.0”) that demands ransom only and the data-threat ransomware (“ransomware 1.5”) that demands ransom with the threat of releasing data for no compliance. Both theoretical modeling and simulation studies suggest that in general both ransomware 2.0 and 1.5 are more profitable than ransomware 1.0, while ransomware 2.0 is always more profitable than ransomware 1.5. Notably, common defensive measures that may work to eliminate the financial incentives of ransomware 1.0 may not work on ransomware 2.0, in particular the data backup practice and the never-pay-ransom strategy. Our findings also suggest that the uncertainties created by this new revenue model may affect attackers’ reputation and users’ willingness-to-pay, therefore, ransomware 2.0 may not always increase the profitability of attackers. Another finding of the study suggests that reputation maximization is critical in ransomware 1.0 and 1.5, but not in ransomware 2.0, where attackers could manipulate reputation for profit maximization. © 2021 River Publishers",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103343828

In a state of tense foreign policy conditions, information protection is an urgent problem of our society. This article presents a unified approach to the systematization of cyber threats. The essence of this approach is to eliminate uncertainties regarding the description of cyber threats. Based on the results of the analysis of existing works on this topic, the advantages and disadvantages of existing approaches are identified. It is important to note that the classification of vulnerabilities in information systems is currently developing rapidly, but the problem of classification of threats remains relevant. The vulnerability remains only a tool for realizing the existing threat. Given the possible risks of information security and cybersecurity of information systems and process control systems at critical infrastructure facilities, a study of known cyberattacks has been conducted. Based on the experience of the world community in the field of cybersecurity and information technology, the classification of methods of intrusion and types of attacks on information systems. Using a formalized approach with the help of drawings and diagrams, the vectors of attacks, the structure of the attack and the development of the information security incident are presented. The description of possible approaches to the development of cyber threat taxonomy is investigated and presented. The definition of key concepts is given. The results of this study can be useful for assessing information security risks, in particular in determining the criticality of the organization’s assets, in creating information security management systems and developing appropriate technical regulations to ensure the continuity of business processes of the organization. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103207414

Physical infrastructures are inextricably tied to the functioning of IT systems that are vulnerable to internal and external cyber threats. Attacks can cause unavailability or malfunction of systems which in turn prevent or mislead ongoing business processes in organizations. Today, organizations not only require cybersecurity programs to protect themselves against cyber threats but also need a resilience strategy to guarantee business continuity even during cyber incidents. This paper includes the results of ongoing research for securing maritime port ecosystems and making them cyber resilient. We propose a framework based on ontologies and logical inference to meet requirements of resilient IT systems regarding response to and recovery from cyber incidents.

This and related developments significantly enlarge the attack surface of organizations. Additionally, more and more attacks do not exploit technical vulnerabilities directly but gain a foothold through phishing or social engineering. Since traditional security systems prove to be no longer sufficient to detect incidents effectively, humans and their specialized knowledge are becoming a critical security factor. Therefore, it is vital to maintain an overview of the cybersecurity knowledge spread across the entire company. However, there is no uniform understanding of knowledge in the field of security analytics. We aim to close this gap by formalizing knowledge and defining a conceptual knowledge model in the context of security analytics. This allows existing research to be better classified and shows that individual areas offer much potential for future research. In particular, the collaboration between domain experts but also between machines and employees could enable the exploitation of previously unused but crucial knowledge. For example, this knowledge is of great value for defining security rules in current security analytics systems. We introduce a proof of concept implementation using visual programming to showcase how even security novices can easily contribute their knowledge to security analytics.

An information security analyst regularly examines sources to stay up to date on security events in the domain of expertise. This may lead to a heavy workload for the information analysts if they do not have proper tools for security event investigation. For example, an information analyst may want to stay aware of cybersecurity events, such as a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on a government agency website. The earlier they detect and understand the threats, the longer the time remaining to alleviate the obstacle and to investigate the event. Therefore, information security analysts need to establish and keep situational awareness active about the security events and their likely effects. However, due to the large volume of information flow, it may be difficult for security analysts and researchers to detect and analyze security events timely. It is important to detect security events timely. This study aims at developing tools that are able to provide timely reports of security incidents. A recent challenge is that the internet community use different languages to share information. For instance, information about security events in Turkey is mostly shared on the internet in Turkish.

In this paper, we present a model-based methodology for cybersecurity related systems design. This field-proven methodology takes into consideration cybersecurity threats alongside the system’s composition and existing mechanisms, in order to communicate, assess and drive the incorporation of security controls into the system design.

The report also highlighted the potential of this technology to be used in political campaigns such as in Gabon and Malaysia. In this sense, the phenomenon of deepfake has become a concern for governments because it poses a short-term threat not only to politics, but also for fraud or cyberbullying.

Most of the investigating experiments are performed using either static analysis or behavior analysis. However, recent studies have shown that both analyses are vulnerable to modern malware files that use several techniques to avoid analysis and detection. Therefore, extracted features could be meaningless and a distraction for malware analysts. However, the volatile memory can expose useful information about malware behaviors and characteristics. In addition, memory analysis is capable of detecting unconventional malware, such as in-memory and fileless malware. However, memory features have not been fully utilized yet. Therefore, this work aims to present a new malware detection and classification approach that extracts memory-based features from memory images using memory forensic techniques. The extracted features can expose the malware’s real behaviors, such as interacting with the operating system, DLL and process injection, communicating with command and control site, and requesting higher privileges to perform specific tasks. We also applied feature engineering and converted the features to binary vectors before training and testing the classifiers. The experiments show that the proposed approach has a high classification accuracy rate of 98.5% and a false positive rate as low as 1.24% using the SVM classifier. The efficiency of the approach has been evaluated by comparing it with other related works. Also, a new memory-based dataset consisting of 2502 malware files and 966 benign samples forming 8898 features and belonging to six memory types has been created and published online for research purposes. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The increasing network security risks can be mitigated by implementing effective IDS methods as a defense mechanism. The proposed research presents an IDS model based on the methodology of the adaptive fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) algorithm. Using this method, two parameters, i.e., the neighborhood size (k) and fuzzy strength parameter (m) were characterized by implementing the particle swarm optimization (PSO). In addition to being used for FKNN parametric optimization, PSO is also used for selecting the conditional feature subsets for detection. To proficiently regulate the indigenous and comprehensive search skill of the PSO approach, two control parameters containing the time-varying inertiaweight (TVIW) and time-varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) were applied to the system. In addition, continuous and binary PSO algorithms were both executed on a multi-core platform. The proposed IDS model was compared with other state-of-The-Art classifiers. The results of the proposed methodology are superior to the rest of the techniques in terms of the classification accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score.

The heterogeneity observed in the generated data from each device has further contributed to latency delays and network traffic concerns. An integral part of current network research encompasses the monitoring of network activities, device identification, and secure exchange of information between different devices. The recognition and administration of these persistently increasing IoT devices have posed major challenges in various fields of their application, like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Hence, the management of network traffic flow between these devices has become a concerning issue. The prolonged inconsistency in cybersecurity systems and constrained computational capabilities have further made IoT devices more vulnerable to adversarial threats. To this end, the preservation and administration of network activities become crucial to manage. In this chapter, we address the network traffic administration issue for different IoT devices. We focus on the efficient characterization of inter-arrival rates of data generated from IoT devices for packet-level and flow-level analysis. Thus, making identification and management of IoT devices exceedingly significant for securing stable functioning of network activities. We also discuss some influential works conjectured to IoT devices and network analysis. The empirical results obtained from real-world network flows have been reported to provide a precise understanding of our observations.

CPSs often incorporate approaches merging from different scientific fields such as embedded systems, control systems, operational technology, information technology systems (ITS), and cybernetics. Major cybersecurity concerns are rising around CPSs because of their expanding uses in the modern world today. Often the security concerns are limited to deriving risk analytics and security assessment. Others focus on the development of intrusion detection and prevention systems. To make the CPSs resilient, it needs a thorough understanding of the current cybersecurity frameworks proposed by different governing bodies in this domain. It is also imperative to realize how these frameworks are applying established security practices. To address the gap in understanding the defense-in-depth security architectures and achieving them within the CPS domain, we analyze the cybersecurity frameworks and the challenges in applying them. To give some background information, we start a discussion of the differences between ITS and CPS. We then present a state-of-the-art review of some of the existing cybersecurity frameworks for risk and resilience management.

With more than thirty states now possessing offensive cyber capabilities1 and cybersecurity incidents such as Stuxnet, WannaCry, and NotPetya causing significant physical effects or financial damage, there is a clear need to find a better way to manage security risks connected with the use of increasingly sophisticated cyber means by states. At present, this issue is on the agenda of two United Nations groups2 and is mainly addressed through a “framework for responsible behavior of states” consisting of international law, voluntary and non-binding norms, and confidence-building measures for states' use of information and communication technologies.3 What the current discussions do not address, however, is whether the security risks could also be regulated through an arms control and inspection regime for cyber weapons. While such a regime has been proposed by scholars,4 states remain skeptical or even actively opposed to efforts to impose traditional arms control measures on offensive cyber capabilities.5 This essay examines why a cyber weapons inspection regime is so difficult to devise. It argues that due to their nature and mode of functioning, cyber weapons significantly differ from traditional nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, such that mechanisms established by traditional arms control treaties either will not work or will not be agreed to by states. Instead, new regulatory approaches are necessary. © Przemysław Roguski 2021.

Numerous lightweight protocols are being proposed for IoT devices communication usage. One of the distinguishable IoT machine-to-machine communication protocols is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, as per the authors best knowledge, there are no available IDS datasets that include MQTT benign or attack instances and thus, no IDS experimental results available. In this paper, the effectiveness of six Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect MQTT-based attacks is evaluated. Three abstraction levels of features are assessed, namely, packet-based, unidirectional flow, and bidirectional flow features. An MQTT simulated dataset is generated and used for the training and evaluation processes. The dataset is released with an open access licence to help the research community further analyse the accompanied challenges. The experimental results demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed ML models to suit MQTT-based networks IDS requirements.

One major context where employees affect their organizations is phishing via email systems, which is a common attack vector used by external actors to penetrate organizational networks, steal employee credentials, and create other forms of harm. In analyzing the behavior of more than 6,000 employees at a large university in the Southeast United States during 20 mock phishing campaigns over a 19-month period, this research effort makes several contributions. First, employees’ negative behaviors like clicking links and then entering data are evaluated alongside the positive behaviors of reporting the suspected phishing attempts to the proper organizational representatives. The analysis displays evidence of both repeat clicker and repeat reporter phenomena and their frequency and Pareto distributions across the study time frame. Second, we find that employees can be categorized according to one of the four unique clusters with respect to their behavioral responses to phishing attacks—“Gaffes,” “Beacons,” “Spectators,” and “Gushers.” While each of the clusters exhibits some level of phishing failures and reports, significant variation exists among the employee classifications.

Therefore, network security has become the focus of attention. Researchers have been doing much research on network security. However, with the expansion of network scale and the diversification of attackers' misbehaviors, some drawbacks have been exposed to traditional network security architecture and its key technologies. Firstly, most of today's network security infrastructures, such as PKI and RPKI, are realized as a centralized architecture. Therefore, the cybersecurity measures built on the trust in these centralized infrastructures expose a single-point of trust problem. The incidents of DigiNotar hacked to issue the malicious certificate for more than 500 websites and Symantec's misinformation of more than 30000 certificate extension vouchers all indicate that once incidents occur in these trust centers, it will be a severe impact on the entire Internet. Secondly, since early network architecture designation did not seriously consider security, the deployment of many later proposed security mechanisms will modify existing network protocols and affect network efficiency. Therefore, there are difficulties in the actual deployment of these security mechanisms. Besides, with the advent of the IoT era, the network's complexity will continue to expand, and network security construction should be participated by many organizations and even the whole people. However, there is a lack of a reliable incentive mechanism to coordinate the cooperation between different organizations and mobilize users' enthusiasm to participate in the network security construction. Nowadays, there is no good solution for these disadvantages, but emerging technology blockchain provides new solutions. Blockchain is a trustworthy distributed database that integrates P2P technology, cryptography, consensus mechanism, and distributed storage technology. Because of blockchain's characteristics such as decentralization, immutability, and auditability, researchers have devoted themselves to researching blockchain-based applications on network security. From the perspective of network security architecture, blockchain-based applications focus on network-layer security, application-layer security, and PKI security. The applications in network-layer include collaborative intrusion detection and inter-domain routing security. The applications in the application-layer include vulnerability crowdsourcing and access control. Blockchain's applications for PKI security is to improve centralized PKI or build decentralized PKI. Furthermore, blockchain's role in these network security applications is classified into true-storage, true-computing, and true-incentive. True-storage is to take blockchain as a storage platform to ensure the authenticity of stored data, avoid data tampering, and make a proper response to the user's data access request. True-computing is to take blockchain as a computing platform based on true-storage and smart contracts. The platform can ensure the computing processes' openness, transparency, and verifiability while ensuring the computing results' authenticity, credibility, and immutability. True-incentive introduces incentive mechanisms based on true-storage and true-computing to realize transparent reward and punishment measures. For each specific blockchain-based application on network security, this paper first introduces the security status, then introduces the specific research works and shows how blockchain is applied to improve safety, finally analyzing the advantages of blockchain technology in this field. In the end, this paper introduces the challenges that should be paid attention to in blockchain-based applications on network security, include privacy, scalability, blockchain security, and structure evolution direction. Moreover, this paper prospects future network security architecture and key technologies based on blockchain. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099030747

Securing the sector’s critical infrastructure is therefore important for any country’s economy. Like many other nations, South Africa has an overarching national cybersecurity strategy aimed at addressing cyber terrorism, cybercriminal activities, cyber vandalism, and cyber sabotage. The aim of this study is to contextualise the water and wastewater sector’s cybersecurity responsibilities within the national cybersecurity legislative and policy environment. This is achieved by conducting a detailed analysis of the international, national and sector cybersecurity stakeholders; legislation and policies; and challenges pertaining to the protection of the water and wastewater sector. The study found some concerning challenges and improvement gaps regarding the complex manner in which the national government is implementing the cybersecurity strategy. The study also found that, along with the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (the national cybersecurity strategy of South Africa), the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, and other supporting legislation and policies make provision for the water and wastewater sector’s computer security incidents response team to be established without the need to propose any new laws or amend existing ones.

The initiatives of regional aviation authorities to upgrade the ATM system have common surveillance and data sharing equipment named ADS-B which is unencrypted. The cybersecurity threat to aviation operations has become more challenging with the up-gradation of ATM which largely depends on ADS-B. Today, the global civil aviation authorities are relying on the data-Link and IT systems for their day-to-day ATM through ADS-B and other Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS). Numerous studies and aviation enthusiasts expressed the vulnerability of the ADS-B due to unencrypted data sharing of ATCS. In this research, a blockchain framework is proposed to address the current security-related weaknesses of the ADS-B application and other data-Linked services of impending ATM. This blockchain model is designed based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform which ensures privacy, confidentiality, and origin/destination authenticity to overcome the cybersecurity threat of ADS-B and other ATCS support systems. This proposed model is significant as it leverages the synergy of multi-agent networks and approved blockchain technology like Hyperledger Fabric for a secure, stable, and unified network for collaboration. Thus, the different risks of upcoming ADS-B based ATM-like eavesdropping, message modification, injection, deletion can be combated using this proposed model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098247953

Design/Methodology/Approach: For determining the ratio of pros and cons of “smart technologies” application in project management, the method of regression analysis is used. The influence of automatization (rationalization) of decision making (and cybersecurity) on the rate of economic growth and the innovation index in 2020 are evaluated. The research objects are 12 countries which transnational corporations are the largest and the most successful in 2020, according to Fortune (2020), being in the top 50 of the “Global 500” ranking. Findings: It is substantiated that “smart technologies” are in high demand in project management. The achieved rationalization of decision making is more important than new risk of information security, which, however, should be taken into account and reduced. Risks are present at each stage of the algorithm of project management with the help of “smart technologies”, but they are also peculiar for all these stages at any other technological mode, though with a different form. Originality/Value: It is proved that the risk component of project management remains unchanged during implementation of “smart technologies”, but the approach to risk management changes – as the risks acquire the cybernetic nature, instead of the social one. The developed algorithm of project management in the conditions of Industry 4.0 shows perspective “smart technologies” for each stage of this process and explains its logic. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097933212

ICT can be described as a range of information, electronics and telematics technologies, using modern microelectronics, telecommunications, and computing to improve all kinds of appliances, techniques and processes that influence different areas of human life. Recently, associated with the digital transformation process, many enterprises have begun to use modern cost and management accounting tools through institutional integrated information systems. ICT competencies are one of the basic technical skills required by accounting graduates. To meet this requirement and help students to be ready for working life, the accounting programs of universities are required to include ICT software tools in accounting courses. Studies show that integrated information technologies are used in accounting courses as limited. Students who take accounting education must be educated to know the data analytics for analyzing masses of big data, to be knowledgeable about data security and cybersecurity, to be prepared for developments in transition to digitalization.

As ADNs feature multi-way interactions between power supply and demand as well as tight coupling between cyber and physical elements, conventional physical-driven energy management schemes are insufficient to tackle the challenges of increasingly complicated operating conditions. In this paper, a novel three-stage decision-making framework is proposed to manage the power losses of ADNs by taking advantage of state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The paper first sheds light on the opportunities and challenges brought by the immense amount of heterogeneous data in the context of ADNs. In particular, generative modeling methods such as generative adversarial networks are introduced to develop a data preprocessing scheme for fixing and enhancing data collected from heterogeneous field devices. The paper then employs recurrent neural networks such as long-short-term-memory networks to infer and formulate the intricate relations between preprocessed data with the objective of enhancing the observability of network topology and line losses. More specifically, an optimization-assisted deep learning method is proposed to facilitate the optimal decision making on power loss reduction under fast-changing operating conditions.

As the United States has stepped up its aggressiveness against cyber adversaries, the possibility is now very real for the Trump administration of an all-out war in cyberspace. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095834470

Generative adversarial nets (GAN)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for in-vehicle network can eliminate the limit of insufficient types of attack data suffered by the deep learning-based IDSs. The existing GAN-based IDS is a hybrid deep learning model built by DNN and GAN, which is too complex to have a short detection time. The evaluation performance of this model can be further improved. To mitigate this issue, we propose another GAN-based intrusion detection method for in-vehicle network, which is a single improved GAN. The proposed model can have better evaluation metrics, e.g., the testing accuracy rate is up to 99.8% and poor detection performance is addressed when a single GAN is used in intrusion detection for the in-vehicle network. In this paper, we design a new loss function for generator in GAN to enhance an ability to produce fake abnormal data, and utilize a sparse enhancement training method helping discriminator in GAN to correct the arbitration bias for fake attack data every 100 steps. In addition, we utilize fewer convolution and de-convolution layers for constructing GAN model, which can reduce the calculation time theoretically and ultimately shorten the detection time to 0.12±0.03ms for a data block built by 64 CAN messages. We evaluate this improved GAN-based intrusion detection by test set. The results demonstrate that our method has not only a capacity of five classifications, but also better evaluation performance than the existing method in the area of GAN-based IDSs for the in-vehicle network. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095136183

After implantation, follow-up of traditional orthopaedic devices is generally limited to episodic monitoring. However, the orthopaedic community may be shifting towards incorporation of smart technology. Smart technology in orthopaedics is a term that encompasses a wide range of potential applications. Smart orthopaedic implants offer the possibility of gathering data and exchanging it with an external reader. They incorporate technology that enables automated sensing, measuring, processing, and reporting of patient or device parameters at or near the implant. While including advanced technology in orthopaedic devices has the potential to benefit patients, physicians, and the scientific community, it may also increase the patient risks associated with the implants. Understanding the benefit-risk profile of new smart orthopaedic devices is critical to ensuring their safety and effectiveness. The 2018 FDA public workshop on orthopaedic sensing, measuring, and advanced reporting technology (SMART) devices was held on April 30, 2018, at the FDA White Oak Campus in Silver Spring, MD with the goal of fostering a collaborative dialogue amongst the orthopaedic community.

With a push towards making the grid smarter, the critical SCADA infrastructure like power system is getting exposed to countless cyberattacks that necessitate the development of state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems (IDS) to provide comprehensive security solutions at different layers in the smart grid network. While considering the continuously evolving attack surfaces at physical, communication, and application layers, existing conventional IDS solutions are insufficient and incapable to resolve multi-dimensional cybersecurity threats because of their specific nature of the operation, either a data-centric or protocol-centric, to detect specific types of attacks. This chapter presents a hybrid intrusion detection system framework by integrating a network-based IDS, model-based IDS, and state-of-the-art machine learning-based IDS to detect unknown and stealthy cyberattacks targeting the SCADA networks. We have applied the cyber-kill model to develop and demonstrate attack vectors and their associated mechanisms. The hybrid IDS utilizes attack signatures in grid measurements and network packets as well as leverages secure phasor measurements to detect different stages of cyber-attacks while following the kill-chain process. As a proof of concept, we present the experimental case study in the context of centralized wide-area protection (CWAP) cybersecurity by utilizing resources of the PowerCyber testbed at Iowa State University (ISU). We also describe different classes of implemented cyber-attacks and generated heterogeneous datasets using the IEEE 39 bus system.

In contrast, this study finds that policymakers create three distinct risk governance frameworks across private owners of critical infrastructures, health and financial service provides, and companies in the broader digital economy. These risk regimes are comparatively analyzed to gauge variance (1) across sectors: in the role of the government and the extent to which it dictates coercive risk management steps, and (2) over time: on the ways in which the government has responded to cyber threats. I found that variance stemmed from the institutional configurations in each regulated sector and the consequent decision-making structures that had been institutionalized early on, rather than the framing of cyber risks. Tracing the governance of cyber risks and the missing link between policymakers’ risk perceptions and actions, this study sheds light on how seemingly technical decisions of cybersecurity governance can be social and political issues that are contingent on institutional settings and early policy decisions, questioning the central role of framing to risk governance outputs. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074768269

Both the height and the width of the newer datasets have increased substantially since they are geared towards evaluation by machine learning methods. The feature sets however are most often statistics, derived either from the packets, or more commonly from the (reconstructed) flows. The ease with which connected clusters of features can be extracted as well as the tendency to be overinclusive to provide researchers with as much data as possible has introduced significant bloat in the datasets. In order to improve the effective and efficient use of the datasets, this article proposes a hybrid feature selection mechanism based on a first-pass filter method and a second-pass embedded method with a central role for statistical testing to identify hierarchies of dominant feature sets. The non-destructive approach allows for the hierarchies to be inspected, interpreted and related to each other. The proposed approach is validated by constructing the feature hierarchies at three different resolutions for all recent datasets published by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (IDS2017, DoS2017, IDS2018 and DDoS2019, millions of samples, 76 features). Three standard supervised learners were given increasing access to the feature (blocks) in terms of their hierarchical position. The results show that attack classes with a clear network component can be detected with cross-validated balanced accuracy, precision and recall above 99%, even when the classification model has been built from just 1 to 4 features, while additionally under a very restrictive sampling regimen: training (0.8%), validation (0.2%) and testing (99%). When selecting models only for classification performance more attack classes are detected more reliably, and while this increases feature use to an average of 12, this is still preferable over using the datasets’ standard set of 76 features. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119692005

The usage of adhoc topologies and the resource constraints of IoT devices and networks makes first line of defense mechanisms like cryptography unsuitable to implement. Therefore, second line of defense mechanisms such as the intrusion detection system become fundamental to detect attacks. In this work, we propose IoT-Sentry, a cross-layer intrusion detection system to detect five different attacks with zero additional overhead. Also, there is a lack of rich, illustrative and concise public datasets in IoT for evaluation of intrusion detection models for IoT networks. Our research work fills this research gap by (1) developing a novel cross-layer IoT dataset which contains four simulation instances for the five attacks in static IoT networks with up to 100 nodes, (2) utilize novel features of cross-layer attacks, and (3) employ ensemble learning model to detect IoT attacks. In our work, the Cooja IoT simulator has been utilized for generating malicious and benign traffic. The IoT attack dataset is then analyzed and fed into centralized detection module implemented at the 6LoWPAN border router. On evaluation, IoT-Sentry achieves on average an accuracy of 99% for 4 out of 5 attacks.

It leverages the existing blockchain attributes to provide clear value propositions that are applicable to transactive energy market applications. Those attributes are evaluated to not only facilitate the energy market mechanisms but also assist with the cybersecurity requirements, such as access control management (including identification, authentication, and authorization); data security and integrity; and resilience management (decentralization, scalability, and performance during faults). The validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a real-time, five-minute double-auction market. The results highlight the framework benefits and provide a strong validation of its applicability to blockchain-based transactive energy systems.

In this paper, we apply differential game theory to analyze the antagonistic dynamics between the attacker and the defender and study two complementary game theoretic formulations, namely the black-box game the and the white-box game: The black-box game can cogently model the opaque-information confrontation and the white-box one is capable to depict the partially transparent-information confrontation. To gain insight into the evolution rule of the antagonistic dynamics between the defensive and the offensive sides, we establish the existence of the Nash equilibrium and the corresponding conditions in the black-box game. Moreover, an iteration algorithm is designed to find the numerical solutions of the Nash equilibrium in the general case and further its analytical solutions in a special case for the white-box game.

CTI sharing platforms are becoming indispensable tools for cooperative and collaborative cybersecurity. Nevertheless, despite the growing research in this area, the emphasis is often placed on the technical aspects, incentives, or implications associated with CTI sharing, as opposed to investigating challenges encountered by users of such platforms. To date, user experience (UX) aspects remain largely unexplored. This paper offers a unique contribution towards understanding the constraining and enabling factors of security information sharing within one of the leading platforms. MISP is an open source CTI sharing platform used by more than 6,000 organizations worldwide. As a technically-advanced CTI sharing platform it aims to cater for a diverse set of security information workers with distinct needs and objectives. In this respect, MISP has to pay an equal amount of attention to the UX in order to maximize and optimize the quantity and quality of threat information that is contributed and consumed. Using mixed methods we shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of MISP from an end-users' perspective and discuss the role UX could play in effective CTI sharing.

New knowledge on best practices, new vulnerabilities, and timely fixes for cybersecurity issues is growing super-linearly, and is spread across numerous, heterogeneous sources. Because of that, community contribution-based, question and answer sites have become clearinghouses for cybersecurity-related inquiries, as they have for many other topics. Historically, Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for different kinds of technical questions, including for cybersecurity. That has been changing, however, with the advent of Security Stack Exchange, a site specifically designed for cybersecurity-related questions and answers. More recently, some cybersecurity-related subreddits of Reddit, have become hubs for cybersecurity-related questions and discussions. The availability of multiple overlapping communities has created a complex terrain to navigate for someone looking for an answer to a cybersecurity question. In this paper, we investigate how and why people choose among three prominent, overlapping, question and answer communities, for their cybersecurity knowledge needs. We aggregated data of several consecutive years of cybersecurity-related questions from Stack Overflow, Security Stack Exchange, and Reddit, and performed statistical, linguistic, and longitudinal analysis. To triangulate the results, we also conducted user surveys. We found that the user behavior across those three communities is different, in most cases. Likewise, cybersecurity-related questions asked on the three sites are different, more technical on Security Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow, and more subjective and personal on Reddit. Moreover, there appears to have been a differentiation of the communities along the same lines, accompanied by overall popularity trends suggestive of Stack Overflow’s decline and Security Stack Exchange’s rise within the cybersecurity community. Reddit is addressing the more subjective, discussion type needs of the lay community, and is growing rapidly. © 2021 Wu et al.

This approach is based on the mathematical modeling in information security—in particular, the use of immune methods to protect several critical system nodes from a predetermined range of attacks, and to minimize the success of an attack on the system. The methodological approach is to systematize the tasks, means and modes of immunization to describe how modern systems can counter the spread of computer attacks. The main conclusions and recommendations are that using an immunization approach will not only improve the security of systems, but also define principles for building systems that are resistant to cyber attacks. The immunization approach enables a symmetrical response to an intruder in a protected system to be produced rapidly. This symmetry provides a step-by-step neutralization of all stages of a cyber attack, which, combined with the accumulation of knowledge of the attacker’s actions, allows a base of defensive responses to be generated for various cyber attack scenarios. The theoretical conclusions are supported by practical experiments describing real-world scenarios for the use of immunization tools to protect against cyber threats. © 2021 by the authors.

These can provide real-time protection and block illegitimate communications, contributing to the cybersecurity posture of the organizations. Most of these solutions are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block malicious communications for known malicious domains, leaving out many others that are malicious but have not yet been updated in the blocklists. This work provides a study to implement a DNS firewall solution based on ML and so improve the detection of malicious domain requests on the fly. For this purpose, a dataset with 34 features and 90 k records was created based on real DNS logs. The data were enriched using OSINT sources. Exploratory analysis and data preparation steps were carried out, and the final dataset submitted to different Supervised ML algorithms to accurately and quickly classify if a domain request is malicious or not. The results show that the ML algorithms were able to classify the benign and malicious domains with accuracy rates between 89% and 96%, and with a classification time between 0.01 and 3.37 s. The contributions of this study are twofold. In terms of research, a dataset was made public and the methodology can be used by other researchers.

Surprisingly, given the expanding worldwide funding and research into Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, there is a paucity of research exploring the public patient perspective on this technology. Our study sets out to address this knowledge gap, by applying the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to explore patient public views on AI. Methods: A Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used involving four study groups with seven participants in each group. This started with a silent generation of ideas regarding the benefits and concerns of AI in Healthcare. Then a group discussion and round-robin process were conducted until no new ideas were generated. Participants ranked their top five benefits and top five concerns regarding the use of AI in healthcare. A final group consensus was reached. Results: Twenty-Eight participants were recruited with the mean age of 47 years. The top five benefits were: Faster health services, Greater accuracy in management, AI systems available 24/7, reducing workforce burden, and equality in healthcare decision making. The top five concerns were: Data cybersecurity, bias and quality of AI data, less human interaction, algorithm errors and responsibility, and limitation in technology. Conclusion: This is the first formal qualitative study exploring patient public views on the use of AI in healthcare, and highlights that there is a clear understanding of the potential benefits delivered by this technology.

We provide a framework that compares nine cost-sensitive individual and ensemble models designed specifically for handling imbalanced data, including cost-sensitive C4.5, roughly balanced bagging, random oversampling bagging, random undersampling bagging, synthetic minority oversampling bagging, random undersampling boosting, synthetic minority oversampling boosting, AdaC2, and EasyEnsemble. Each ensemble’s performance is tested against a range of benchmarked power system datasets utilizing balanced accuracy, Kappa statistics, and AUC metrics. Our findings demonstrate that EasyEnsemble outperformed significantly in comparison to its rivals across the board. Furthermore, undersampling and oversampling strategies were effective in a boosting-based ensemble but not in a bagging-based ensemble. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the current fog-based systems cannot handle the ever-increasing IoMT’s big data. Moreover, they are not lightweight and are designed for network attack detection only. In this work, a hybrid (for host and network) lightweight system is proposed for early attack detection in the IoMT fog. In an adaptive online setting, six different incremental classifiers were implemented, namely a novel Weighted Hoeffding Tree Ensemble (WHTE), Incremental K-Nearest Neighbors (IKNN), Incremental Naïve Bayes (INB), Hoeffding Tree Majority Class (HTMC), Hoeffding Tree Naïve Bayes (HTNB), and Hoeffding Tree Naïve Bayes Adaptive (HTNBA). The system was benchmarked with seven heterogeneous sensors and a NetFlow data infected with nine types of recent attack. The results showed that the proposed system worked well on the lightweight fog devices with ~100% accuracy, a low detection time, and a low memory usage of less than 6 MiB.

However, the ubiquity of massive continuously generated data streams poses an enormous challenge to efficient detection schemes and demands fast, memory-constrained online algorithms that are capable to deal with concept drifts. Feature selection plays an important role when it comes to improve outlier detection in terms of identifying noisy data that contain irrelevant or redundant features. State-of-the-art work either focuses on unsupervised feature selection for data streams or (offline) outlier detection. Substantial requirements to combine both fields are derived and compared with existing approaches. The comprehensive review reveals a research gap in unsupervised feature selection for the improvement of outlier detection methods in data streams. Thus, a novel algorithm for Unsupervised Feature Selection for Streaming Outlier Detection, denoted as UFSSOD, will be proposed, which is able to perform unsupervised feature selection for the purpose of outlier detection on streaming data. Furthermore, it is able to determine the amount of top-performing features by clustering their score values. A generic concept that shows two application scenarios of UFSSOD in conjunction with off-the-shell online outlier detection algorithms has been derived. Extensive experiments have shown that a promising feature selection mechanism for streaming data is not applicable in the field of outlier detection. Moreover, UFSSOD, as an online capable algorithm, yields comparable results to a state-of-the-art offline method trimmed for outlier detection. © 2021 by the authors.

The developed IoT architecture based on a DNN introduces a new approach for the online monitoring of AGVs against cyber attacks with a cheap and easy implementation instead of the traditional cyber attack detection schemes in the literature. The proposed DNN is trained based on experimental AGV data that represent the real state of the AGV and different types of cyber attacks including a random attack, ramp attack, pulse attack, and sinusoidal attack that is injected by the attacker into the internet network. The proposed DNN is compared with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms such as a one dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a supported vector machine model (SVM), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a decision tree for greater validation. Furthermore, the proposed IoT architecture based on a DNN can provide an effective detection for the AGV status with an excellent accuracy of 96.77% that is significantly greater than the accuracy based on the traditional schemes. The AGV status based on the proposed IoT architecture with a DNN is visualized by an advanced IoT platform named CONTACT Elements for IoT. Different test scenarios with a practical setup of an AGV with IoT are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT architecture based on a DNN.

Correctness of protocols is established via the procedures of their verification. A classical communication system includes a pair of interacting systems. Recent developments of computing and communication grids for radio broadcasting, cellular networks, communication subsystems of super-computers, specialized grids for numerical methods and networks on chips require verification of protocols for any number of devices. For analysis of computing and communication grid structures, a new class of infinite Petri nets has been introduced and studied for more than 10 years. Infinite Petri nets were also applied for simulating cellular automata. Rectangular, triangular and hexagonal grids on plane, hyper cube and hyper torus in multidimensional space have been considered. Composing and solving in parametric form infinite Diophantine systems of linear equations allowed us to prove the protocol properties for any grid size and any number of dimensions. Software generators of infinite Petri net models have been developed. Special classes of graphs, such as a graph of packet transmission directions and a graph of blockings, have been introduced and studied. Complex deadlocks have been revealed and classified. In the present paper, infinite Petri nets are divided into two following kinds: a single infinite construct and an infinite set of constructs of specified size (and number of dimensions). Finally, the paper discusses possible future work directions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121267177

The academic field of cybersecurity economics is highly interdisciplinary since it combines core findings and tools from disciplines such as sociology, psychology, law, political science, and computer science. This study aims to develop an extensive and consistent survey based on a literature review and publicly available reports. This review contributes by aggregating the available knowledge from 28 studies, out of a collection of 628 scholarly articles, to answer five specific research questions. The focus is how identified topics have been conceptualized and studied variously.

The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system.

With the release of the Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China and the general data protection regulation in the European Union, data privacy and security have become a worldwide concern. Federated learning can train the global model without exchanging user data, thus protecting users' privacy. Nevertheless, federated learning is still facing many issues, such as the small size of local data in each device, over-fitting of local model, and the data sparsity, which makes it difficult to reach higher accuracy. Meanwhile, with the advent of 5G (the 5th generation mobile communication technology) era, the data volume and transmission rate of personal devices are expected to be 10 to 100 times higher than the current ones, which requires higher model efficiency. Knowledge distillation can transfer the knowledge from the teacher model to a more compact student model so that the student model can approach or surpass the performance of teacher model, thus effectively solve the problems of large model parameter and high communication cost. However, the accuracy of student model is lower than teacher model after knowledge distillation. Therefore, a federated distillation approach is proposed with attentional mechanisms for recommendation systems. First, the method introduces Kullback-Leibler divergence and regularization term to the objective function of federated distillation to reduce the impact of heterogeneity between teacher network and student network; then it introduces multi-head attention mechanism to improve model accuracy by adding information to the embeddings. Finally, an improved adaptive training mechanism is introduced for learning rate to automatically switch optimizers and choose appropriate learning rates, thus increasing convergence speed of model. Experiment results validate efficiency of the proposed methods: compared to the baselines, the training time of the proposed model is reduced by 52%, the accuracy is increased by 13%, the average error is reduced by 17%, and the NDCG is increased by 10%. © Copyright 2021, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

While computers and communication networks have become the new oil that defines the wealth of countries, research and industrial communities have been the driving forces that have made this transition possible. In the future, the same communities and stakeholders are required to enable the transition to net-zero communication networks. With reference to mobile communications, 5G is an evolution from all previous networks with the adoption of new radio access technologies, multisliced architecture, cloud-native and automation, and so on. By definition, 5G is a network that adapts to user needs and dynamic changes in traffic, designed to serve a new class of users: 'machines.' Therefore, latency has become a critical metric in 5G. Looking forward, 6G shall employ cell-less access networks, integrated nonterrestrial networks, joint sensing and communications, new spectrums such as terahertz (THz) communications, switching from traditional channel-based design paradigms to designing channels through novel technologies such as intelligent reconfigurable surfaces, open interfaces that interconnect all network functions, end-to-end orchestrators, and, most noticeably, artificial intelligence (AI) machines that govern all functional modules and operational services. The various network functions generate traces of various operations that are ingested into databases; then AI will leverage this data for optimized decisions that are reflected into network status transitions, resource utilization, service enhancement, and ultimately lead to self-synthesizing networks. Built upon commercial clouds, 6G will have the flexibility to scale and restructure for more resilient response to traffic fluctuations and user requirements. To this end, cybersecurity features will become an embedded part of network functions to shield the network services not only from external threats but also from hosting domains. From an air interface perspective, 6G will integrate nonterrestrial (space, air, drone, and ocean) communications technologies to connect and route new users such as drones and coastal trading vessels. Furthermore, future wireless networks need to make use of a spectrum that extends into the optical spectrum and includes the THz range. The channel becomes a critical component due to the impact of blockages and random orientations at these frequencies. Active and passive intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) will become a new wireless system element that will help overcome new challenges related to coverage and the propagation channel. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120796409

Having network intrusion detection with zero false alarm is a challenge. This is due to the asymmetry between informative features and irrelevant and redundant features of the dataset. In this work, a novel machine learning based hybrid intrusion detection system is proposed. It combined support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm (GA) methodologies with an innovative fitness function developed to evaluate system accuracy. This system was examined using the CICIDS2017 dataset, which contains normal and most up-to-date common attacks. Both algorithms, GA and SVM, were executed in parallel to achieve two optimal objectives simultaneously: obtaining the best subset of features with maximum accuracy. In this scenario, an SVM was employed using different values of hyperparameters of the kernel function, gamma, and degree. The results were benchmarked with KDD CUP 99 and NSL-KDD. The results showed that the proposed model remarkably outperformed these benchmarks by up to 5.74%. This system will be effective in cloud computing, as it is expected to provide a high level of symmetry between information security and detection of attacks and malicious intrusion. © 2021 by the authors.

In fact, standard algorithms currently employed in BCI systems are inadequate to deal with cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose a solution to improve the cybersecurity of BCI systems. As a case study, we focus on P300-based BCI systems using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms and EEG data. First, we verified that SVM algorithms are incapable of identifying hacking by simulating a set of cyberattacks using fake P300 signals and noise-based attacks. This was achieved by comparing the performance of several models when validated using real and hacked P300 datasets. Then, we implemented our solution to improve the cybersecurity of the system. The proposed solution is based on an EEG channel mixing approach to identify anomalies in the transmission channel due to hacking. Our study demonstrates that the proposed architecture can successfully identify 99.996% of simulated cyberattacks, implementing a dedicated counteraction that preserves most of BCI functions. © 2021 by the authors.

There is a need to define what it means to be ethically competent in the era of IR4.0. The previous competence models still lack consideration of both artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence (EI) skills. AI brings new opportunities to cyber security organizations that focus on AI skills related to cognitive Intelligence or intelligent quotient (IQ). EI, which refers to emotional quotient (EQ), is a good predictor of ethical competence as it can perceive and express emotions precisely to facilitate thought to understand and manage emotions.

We assert that, while higher board IT competence has positive implications in IT value-creation, it could have a negative implication in the IT value-protection context. When firms have a more IT competent board, equity investors’ ex-ante expectations of superior oversight of IT by the board are baked into those firms’ equity prices. When such firms experience operational IT failures, investors would view their boards as relatively ineffective in IT oversight and adjust more sharply the ex-ante expectations built into equity prices. Using agency-theoretic arguments, we develop this reasoning into a hypothesis that board IT competence is negatively associated with firm market performance post operational IT failures.

A honeypot may be successful provided that it disguises its identity. However, cyberattackers continuously endeavour to discover honeypots for evading any deception and bolstering their attacks. Active fingerprinting attack is one such technique that may be used to discover honeypots by sending specially designed traffic. Preventing a fingerprinting attack is possible but doing that may hinder the process of dealing with the attackers, counteracting the purpose of a honeypot. Instead, detecting an attempted fingerprinting attack in real-time can enhance a honeypot's capability, uninterruptedly managing any immediate consequences and preventing the honeypot being identified. Nevertheless, it is difficult to detect and predict an attempted fingerprinting attack due to the challenge of isolating it from other similar attacks, particularly when imprecise observations are involved in the monitoring of the traffic. Dynamic fuzzy rule interpolation (D-FRI) enables an adaptive approach for effective reasoning with such situations by exploiting the best of both inference and interpolation. The dynamic rules produced by D-FRI facilitate approximate reasoning with perpetual changes that often occur in this type of application, where dynamic rules are required to cover new network conditions. This paper proposes a D-FRI-Honeypot, an enhanced honeypot running D-FRI framework in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis, to detect and predict an attempted fingerprinting attack on honeypots. This D-FRI-Honeypot works with a sparse rule base but is able to detect active fingerprinting attacks when it does not find any matching rules. Also, it learns from current network conditions and offers a dynamically enriched rule base to support more precise detection. This D-FRI-Honeypot is tested against five popular fingerprinting tools (namely, Nmap, Xprobe2, NetScanTools Pro, SinFP3 and Nessus), to demonstrate its successful applications. © 2017 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120535117

Some methods that help to generate biometric features were considered and compared with a cryptographic key. For comparing compact vectors of biometric images and cryptographic keys, the following methods are analyzed: designing and training of bidirectional associative memory; designing and training of single-layer and multilayer neural networks. As a result of comparative analysis of algorithms for extracting primary biometric features and comparing the generated image to a private key within the proposed authentication system, it was found that deep convolutional networks and neural network bidirectional associative memory are the most effective approach to process the data. In the research, an approach based on the integration of a biometric system and a cryptographic module was proposed, which allows using of a generated secret cryptographic key based on a biometric sample as the output of a neural network. The RSA algorithm is chosen to generate a private cryptographic key by use of convolutional neural networks and Python libraries. The software authentication module is implemented based on the client-server architecture using various internal Python libraries. Such authentication system should be used in systems where the user data and his valuable information resources are stored or where the user can perform certain valuable operations for which a cryptographic key is required. Proposed software module based on convolutional neural networks will be a perfect tool for ensuring the confidentiality of information and for all information-communication systems, because protecting information system from unauthorized access is one of the most pressing problems. This approach as software module solves the problem of secure generating and storing the secret key and author propose combination of the convolutional neural network with bidirectional associative memory, which is used to recognize the biometric sample, generate the image, and match it with a cryptographic key. The use of this software approach allows today to reduce the probability of errors of the first and second kind in authentication system and absolute number of errors was minimized by an average of 1,5 times. The proportion of correctly recognized images by the comparating together convolutional networks and neural network bidirectional associative memory in the authentication software module increased to 96,97%, which is on average from 1,08 times up to 1,01 times The authors further plan a number of scientific and technical solutions to develop and implement effective methods, tools to meet the requirements, principles and approaches to cybersecurity and cryptosystems for provide integrity and confidentiality of information in experimental computer systems and networks. © 2021 MECS.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120430959

By protecting against them, this research aims to develop cybersecurity measurement approaches to ensure the security and privacy of patient information using blockchain technology in healthcare. Blockchains need huge resources to store big data. This paper presents an innovative solution, namely patient-centric healthcare data management (PCHDM). It comprises the following: (i) in an on-chain health record database, hashes of health records are stored as health record chains in Hyperledger fabric, and (ii) off-chain solutions that encrypt actual health data and store it securely over the interplanetary file system (IPFS) which is the decentralized cloud storage system that ensures scalability, confidentiality, and resolves the problem of blockchain data storage. A security smart contract hosted through container technology with Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus ensures patient privacy by verifying patient preferences before sharing health records. The Distributed Ledger technology performance is tested under hyper ledger caliper benchmarks in terms of transaction latency, resource utilization, and transaction per second.

In order to increase the knowledge in this area and promote the EU security frameworks the model for the continuous building of teacher competence has been proposed and planned to be implemented in Ukraine. The proposed model will contribute towards improving the excellence of educators and academics, as well as increase competitiveness of educational programmes on cybersecurity among similar institutions in the EU countries. Various studies focused on the development of competence of the students to prepare them for the job market and build a comprehensive portfolio, education-business partnerships and collaboration. However, the issue of developing teacher expertise to achieve high quality of education remains open. We highlighted the importance of creating a cybersecurity ecosystem through the cooperation with different stakeholders and by implementing the model for continuous development of teacher competence. Before building the model the overview and analysis of different teacher professional development approaches were conducted. Analysis showed that for our goal the best suitable approach is a model that consists of two stages based on self-education and group education approaches with 7 processes inside. The study revealed that competence may be achieved through a number of activities which may be grouped under four generic categories: student and staff training, academic and business seminars, business-oriented roundtable debates, and research. The model uses as main methods of achieving a better quality of education in cybersecurity the development of new training courses and modernization of educational programs, and for raising awareness among businesses and regulatory bodies-the workshops and roundtables. © 2021 MECS.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120407187

Memcached vulnerabilities have been targeted by attackers using DDoS amplification attacks. GitHub and Arbor Networks were the victims of Memcached DDoS attacks with 1.3 Tbps and 1.8 Tbps attack strengths, respectively. The bandwidth amplification factor of nearly 50,000 makes Memcached the deadliest DDoS attack vector to date. In recent times, fellow researchers have made specific efforts to analyze and evaluate Memcached vulnerabilities; however, the solutions provided for security are based on best practices by users and service providers. This study is the first attempt at modifying the architecture of Memcached servers in the context of improving security against DDoS attacks. This study discusses the Memcached protocol, the vulnerabilities associated with it, the future challenges for different IoT applications associated with caches, and the solutions for detecting Memcached DDoS attacks.

Understanding of the human factor and its influence on children, namely their attitudes and behaviors online, is pivotal to reinforce their awareness towards cyberattacks, and to promote their digital citizenship. This paper aims to present an integrated cybersecurity and cyberawareness strategy composed of three major steps: (1) Cybersecurity attitude and behavior assessment, (2) self-diagnosis, and (3) teaching/learning activities. The following contributions are made: Two questionnaires to assess risky attitudes and behaviors regarding cybersecurity; a self-diagnosis to measure students’ skills on cybersecurity; a lesson plan addressing cyberawareness to be applied on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and citizenship education curricular units. Cybersecurity risky attitudes and behaviors were evaluated in a junior high school population of 164 students attending the sixth and ninth grades. The assessment focused on two main subjects: To identify the attitudes and behaviors that raise the risk on cybersecurity among the participating students; to characterize the acquired students’ cybersecurity and cyberawareness skills. Global and individual scores and the histograms for attitudes and behaviors are presented. The items in which we have observed significant differences between sixth and ninth grades are depicted and quantified by their corresponding p-values obtained through the Mann–Whitney non-parametric test. Regarding the results obtained on the assessment of attitudes and behaviors, although positive, we observed that the attitudes and behaviors in ninth grade students are globally inferior compared to those attained by sixth grade students. The deployed strategy for cyberawareness was applied in a school context; however, the same approach is suitable to be applied in other types of organizations, namely enterprises, healthcare institutions and public sector. © 2021 by the authors.

Robust hybrid power system state estimation could enhance the resilience of the control of these systems. This paper proposes a two-stage, highly robust least-trimmed squares (LTS)-based estimator. The first step combines the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements using the robust LTS-based estimator. The second step merges the obtained state results with the available phasor measurement units (PMUs) measurements using a robust Huber M-estimator. The proposed robust LTS-based estimator shows good performance in the presence of Gaussian measurement noise. The proposed estimator is shown to resist and correct the effect of false data injection (FDI) attacks and random errors on the measurement vector and the Jacobian matrix. The state estimation (SE) is executed on a modified version of the CIGRE bipole LCC-HVDC benchmark model integrated into the IEEE 12-bus AC dynamic test system.

The major scientific contribution of our study is the empirical model build on the data from the online questionnaire conducted with randomly selected respondents (N = 523) from four European Union (EU) countries and Russia. Even though our results are subject to limitations (no Southern of Northern European countries are included in the scope of this research, which might have yielded different results due to the differences in wealth of citizens and climate in comparison to the Central and Eastern European countries or Germany), they demonstrate that the users included in our sample generally feel inclined to the smart homes technologies and perceive them as a plausible means for improving the safety and security of their lives. On the other hand, some respondents from our sample expressed their concerns over the cybersecurity and technology dependence issues associated with smart homes. It is also apparent that younger respondents (aged 16–35) featured in our research are more worried about their personal data being monitored and analyzed (with a pending threat of leakages). All these results are original and constitute an important scientific value-added to the field of research in smart home technologies and their acceptance by the general public. We demonstrate that the further enhancement of smart homes, and the increase of their popularity and affordability among the customers both in the Central and Eastern European countries and beyond, might depend on the development of the smart grids which these smart homes are an integral part of. The reliability of the smart systems constitutes the key element for achieving the satisfaction of the smart homes residents, and hence needs to be achieved and secured in an effective way. This would ensure the right mix and balance of energy security and efficiency for all customers involved in this process. © 2021 by the authors.

To exchange data between controller area network (CAN) and Ethernet, a gateway system is required to provide a communication interface. Additionally, the existence of networked devices exposes automobiles to cyber security threats. Against this background, a gateway for CAN/CAN with flexible data-rate (CANFD) to scalable service-oriented middleware over IP (SOME/IP) protocol conversion is designed, and security schemes are implemented in the routing process to provide integrity and confidentiality protections. Based on NXP-S32G, the designed gateway is implemented and evalu-ated. Under most operating conditions, the CPU and the RAM usage are less than 5% and 20 MB, respectively. Devices running a Linux operating system can easily bear such a system resource over-head. The latency caused by the security scheme accounts for about 25% of the entire protocol conversion latency. Considering the security protection provided by the security scheme, this overhead is worthwhile. The results show that the designed gateway can ensure a CAN/CANFD to SOME/IP protocol conversion with a low system resource overhead and a low latency while effectively resist-ing hacker attacks such as frame forgery, tampering, and sniffing. © 2021 by the authors.

A special place among such generators is occupied by additive Fibonacci generators (AFG). By itself, such a generator is not cryptographically strong. Nevertheless, when used as a primary it can be quite resistant to cryptanalysis generators. This paper proposes a modification to AGF, the essence of which is to use prime numbers as modules of recurrent equations describing the operation of generators. This modification made it possible to ensure the constancy of the repetition period of the output pseudorandom pulse sequence in the entire range of possible values of the initial settings–keys (seed) at specific values of the module. In addition, it has proposed a new generator scheme, which consists of two generators: the first of which is based on a modified AFG and the second is based on a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). The output pulses of both generators are combined through a logic element XOR. The results of the experiment show that the specific values of modules provide a constant repetition period of the output pseudorandom pulse sequence in a whole range of possible values of the initial settings–keys (seed) and provide all the requirements of the NIST test to statistical characteristics of the sequence. Modified AFGs are designed primarily for hardware implementation, which allows them to provide high performance. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, cybersecurity researchers and practitioners need to aid SMEs in their defence against cyber threats. Research has shown that SMEs require solutions that are automated and adapted to their context. In recent years, we have seen a surge in initiatives to share cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to improve collective cybersecurity resilience. Shared CTI has the potential to answer the SME call for automated and adaptable solutions. Sadly, as we demonstrate in this paper, current shared intelligence approaches scarcely address SME needs. We must investigate how shared CTI can be used to improve SME cybersecurity resilience. In this paper, we tackle this challenge using a systematic review to discover current state-of-the-art approaches to using shared CTI. We find that threat intelligence sharing platforms such as MISP have the potential to address SME needs, provided that the shared intelligence is turned into actionable insights. Based on this observation, we developed a prototype application that processes MISP data automatically, prioritises cybersecurity threats for SMEs, and provides SMEs with actionable recommendations tailored to their context. Subsequent evaluations in operational environments will help to improve our application, such that SMEs are enabled to thwart cyberattacks in future. © 2021 by the authors.

Such advanced ecosystems, where utility-owned and non utility-owned assets can contribute toward grid operations, generally require distributed communication and grid architectures. We posit the potential of using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) in supporting such applications, although their full potential has not been fully used, for example in designing long-term scalable solutions in operational technology applications. This is partly due to the lack of standardization across and between different DLTs, as well as other supporting building blocks (e.g., communication protocols). This paper attempts to address this gap by proposing a DLT cybersecurity stack specifically designed for researchers, DLT technology developers, and end users (such as utilities). The DLT cybersecurity stack has been notionally mapped to related cybersecurity components, namely the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite, and existing Smart Grid architecture frameworks. In addition, the paper discusses several cybersecurity implications, and demonstrates the potential uses of the DLT cybersecurity stack through multiple power and energy use cases. It is important to note that the stack can be also applied to the DLT use cases that are outside the power and energy domain.

We first introduce usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable events with at least a certain security level, and the highest usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES.

Recently, malware detection based on low-level hardware features (e.g., Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) information) has emerged as an effective alternative solution to address the complexity and performance overheads of traditional software-based detection methods. Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMD) techniques depend on standard Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to detect signatures of malicious applications by monitoring built-in HPC registers during execution at run-time. Prior HMD methods though effective have limited their study on detecting malicious applications that are spawned as a separate thread during application execution, hence detecting stealthy malware patterns at run-time remains a critical challenge. Stealthy malware refers to harmful cyber attacks in which malicious code is hidden within benign applications and remains undetected by traditional malware detection approaches. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive review of recent advances in hardware-assisted malware detection studies that have used standard ML techniques to detect the malware signatures. Next, to address the challenge of stealthy malware detection at the processor’s hardware level, we propose StealthMiner, a novel specialized time series machine learning-based approach to accurately detect stealthy malware trace at run-time using branch instructions, the most prominent HPC feature. StealthMiner is based on a lightweight time series Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) model that automatically identifies potentially contaminated samples in HPC-based time series data and utilizes them to accurately recognize the trace of stealthy malware. Our analysis demonstrates that using state-of-the-art ML-based malware detection methods is not effective in detecting stealthy malware samples since the captured HPC data not only represents malware but also carries benign applications’ microar-chitectural data. The experimental results demonstrate that with the aid of our novel intelligent approach, stealthy malware can be detected at run-time with 94% detection performance on average with only one HPC feature, outperforming the detection performance of state-of-the-art HMD and general time series classification methods by up to 42% and 36%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Literature review: Although there is considerable literature on users' mental models in security and privacy, there has been limited study of mental models related to data breaches. Research questions: 1. How do users understand data breaches? 2. What are their perceptions of the causes, responsibilities, and consequences, as well as possible prevention and appropriate follow up? Methodology: We explored end-user understanding of internet data breaches by conducting a study with 35 participants. They were asked to draw their understanding of data breaches and answer some open-ended and closed-ended questions afterwards. Results/discussion: Although their drawings varied in detail and complexity, we identified four patterns in the participants' drawings: they illustrated abstractions of attacks to gain administrator access, end-user access, backdoor access, or access using database server vulnerabilities. We found that participants had a basic model of how an internet data breach happens, but with significant uncertainties regarding system vulnerabilities, causes, consequences, prevention methods, and follow-up steps after a breach. Conclusions: In all, end-user mental models of internet data breaches are basic and show gaps that emphasize the need for improved communication to increase users' awareness and help them hold companies accountable. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118235313

In such networks, connection requests from devices residing inside the perimeter are implicitly assumed to be trusted. However, in practice, a considerable fraction of cyberattacks emanate from inside the enterprise network making the perimeter-based trust assumption unrealistic. Zero-trust architecture (ZTA) is an emerging alternative to perimeter-based security, where each connection request for accessing an enterprise resource goes through stringent security checks and validation irrespective of the location of the requesting device. In ZTA, every connection request is authenticated and authorized by a trusted centralized component called the policy decision point (PDP) and subsequently granted (or denied) access to the requested resource. However, the centralized nature of the PDP often makes it vulnerable to various attacks such as compromise of secret keys, impersonation and denial of service. In this article, we propose DistriTrust which distributes trust across multiple PDPs using the notion of threshold signatures. However, involving multiple PDPs also increases latency. In order to keep latency as low as possible, we study different threshold signature schemes and identify a suitable scheme for DistriTrust. We also discuss the security properties achieved by DistriTrust.

The need for as-certaining the trustworthiness of digital media calls for automatic yet accurate DeepFake detection algorithms. This paper presents an attention-based DeepFake detection (ADD) method that exploits the fine-grained and spatial locality attributes of artificially synthesized videos for enhanced detection. ADD framework is composed of two main components including face close-up and face shut-off data augmentation methods and is applicable to any classifier based on convolutional neural network architecture. ADD first locates potentially manipulated areas of the input image to extract representative features. Second, the detection model is forced to pay more attention to these forgery regions in the decision-making process through a particular focus on interpreting the sample in the learning phase. ADD’s performance is evaluated against two challenging datasets of DeepFake forensics, i.e., Celeb-DF (V2) and WildDeepFake. We demonstrated the generalization of ADD by evaluating four popular classifiers, namely VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, and MobileNet. The obtained results demonstrate that ADD can boost the detection performance of all four baseline classifiers sig-nificantly on both benchmark datasets.

This paper uses hand-collected data related to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for S&P 500 firms and explores whether the presence of a CIO role, human capital characteristics of the CIO, and structural capital characteristics of the firm and the CIO are related to a firm's cybersecurity risk exposure. This study finds that firms disclosing the presence of a CIO are more likely to be breached, even after matching on the likelihood of a breach and controlling for the likelihood that a firm would choose to disclose a CIO. This study also finds predictable variations in the likelihood of a breach among CIOs based on various human capital dimensions (including past technology experience, external board memberships, firm tenure, and CIO tenure) and structural capital dimensions (including a recognized commitment to IT and charging the CIO with multiple responsibilities).

Smart cities must secure their critical infrastructures against cyberattacks. Water distribution is one of these infrastructures. In this paper, a bi-level optimization model is developed for cyberattacks that can result in physical consequence of multiple node failures in water networks. Unlike the existing research that considered random cyberattacks, the proposed cyber–physical attack model injects targeted false data into pumps’ measurements causing pressure head buildup in targeted nodes. In addition, the injected false data will ensure bypassing the existing water system's state-estimation and bad data detection methods, a condition that was not considered in previously developed attacks. The findings indicate the minimum number of targeted pumps required to create the most severe cascading failures across the water network. The model will identify strategic pumps that are likely to be targeted by cyberattacks, and therefore should be given extra layers of protection by water authorities. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116074846

Everyday information security is essentially defined by the maturity of security operations and incident response capabilities. However, focusing on internal information only has proven insufficient in an ever-changing threat landscape. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and its sharing are deemed necessary to cope with advanced threats and strongly influence security capabilities. Therefore, in this work, we develop CTI-SOC2M2, a capability maturity model that uses the degree of CTI integration as a proxy for SOC service maturity. In the course, we examine existing maturity models in the domains of Security Operations Centers (SOCs), incident response, and CTI. In search of adequate maturity assessment, we show threat intelligence dependencies through applicable data formats. As the systematic development of maturity models demands, our mixed methodology approach contributes a new in-depth analysis of intelligence-driven security operations. The resulting CTI-SOC2M2 model contains CTI formats, SOC services and is complemented with an evaluation through expert interviews. A prototypical, tool-based implementation is aimed to document steps towards the model's practical application. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115892705

Traditional network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) usually have difficulties detecting these attacks because they need to adapt to more advanced or challenging technologies of novel attacks, yet updating them can be computationally expensive and complicated. Therefore, an adaptive IDS is crucial to keep computer networks protected. In addition, consistent update of IDS datasets is essential due to the advancement in network technology and attack strategies. Updating the IDS datasets would allow for the testing of the proposed IDSs on datasets that are relevant to the recent attacks. Moreover, the connection between processing raw network data and creating an adaptive IDS has not been sufficiently studied in this domain. Therefore, this study presents an adaptive IDS and a new real-world network dataset called the UKM-IDS20. The proposed IDS employs the homogeneous ensemble method to create a model that can be periodically updated to detect novel attacks. The update procedure includes training new classifiers and adding them to the base ensemble model. Since this procedure requires further data, a simple data acquisition methodology is used for processing raw network traffic data. This process involves three stages; packet capturing, packet integration, and feature extraction. The collected data from the tests of this study is then used to create the UKM-IDS20 dataset. The created dataset contains 46 features and covers four types of attacks, namely ARP poisoning, DoS, Scans, and Exploits. The complexity of the UKM-IDS20 is compared to the KDD99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets from two aspects. First, an analysis of the features and classes is demonstrated using the rough-set theory. Second, a dynamic artificial neural network is used to test and compare the three datasets mentioned above. The results show a higher complexity and relevancy of the features in the introduced dataset. The UKM-IDS20 dataset is publicly available and can be accessed by all researchers.

However, 5G suffers from inherent protocols, hardware, and software vulnerabilities that seriously threaten the communicating entities' cyber-physical security. To overcome these limitations in the EVCS system, this paper analyses the impact of False Data Injection (FDI) and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks on the operation of EVCS. This work is an extension of the previously published conference paper about the EVCS. As new features, this paper simulates the FDI attack and the syn flood DDoS attacks on 5G enabled remote Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that controls the solar photovoltaics (PV) controller, Battery Energy Storage (BES) controller, and EV controller of the EVCS. The extent of delay has been increased to more than 500 ms with the severe DDoS attack via 5G. The attacks make the EVCS system oscillate or shift the DC operating point. The frequency of oscillation, its damping, and the system's resiliency are found to be related to the attacks' intensity and the target controller. Finally, the novel stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are proposed solely based on the electrical fingerprint.

For this, organizations enforce physical, logical, and administrative controls to protect their information from being corrupted, manipulated, or breached. However, an employee with little awareness of cybersecurity threats is an easy target for attackers. Nowadays, companies implement security awareness using policies, procedures, and training sessions, to list a few. Traditional information security awareness sessions have relied heavily on presentation slides and videos. This paper aims to improve the employees’ cybersecurity awareness by developing an interactive video game, a cyber shield game, that includes various embedded threat scenarios. The proposed game consists of four levels. The password complexity level educates players about password threats. The social engineering level aware employees about email attachments and trespass threats. The phishing attack level educates employees about phishing emails and ransomware threats. Finally, the physical security level aware employees about threats to storage and work documents’ disposal. Further, two surveys, pre-game and post-game, are conducted to estimate the players’ knowledge and experience in cybersecurity threats. The proposed security awareness program is applied to ten employees randomly chosen from different organizations. Experimental results indicate that the cyber shield training and awareness program is more interactive than traditional awareness methods. Results also suggest that the proposed awareness program improves the employees’ cybersecurity awareness level by 51.4%. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112567518

Rarity occurs when the positive (attack) class only has a small number of instances for machine learning classifiers to train upon, thus making it difficult for the classifiers to discriminate and learn from the positive class. To investigate rarity, we examine three individual web attacks in big data from the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset: “Brute Force-Web”, “Brute Force-XSS”, and “SQL Injection”. These three individual web attacks are also severely imbalanced, and so we evaluate whether random undersampling (RUS) treatments can improve the classification performance for these three individual web attacks. The following eight different levels of RUS ratios are evaluated: no sampling, 999:1, 99:1, 95:5, 9:1, 3:1, 65:35, and 1:1. For measuring classification performance, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) metrics are obtained for the following seven different classifiers: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CB), LightGBM (LGB), XGBoost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR) (with the first four learners being ensemble learners and for comparison, the last three being single learners). We find that applying random undersampling does improve overall classification performance with the AUC metric in a statistically significant manner. Ensemble learners achieve the top AUC scores after massive undersampling is applied, but the ensemble learners break down and have poor performance (worse than NB and DT) when no sampling is applied to our unique and harsh experimental conditions of severe class imbalance and rarity. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106957990

One typical application of DL in IoT is device identification from wireless signals, namely, noncryptographic device identification (NDI). However, learning components in NDI systems have to evolve to adapt to operational variations, such a paradigm is termed as incremental learning (IL). Various IL algorithms have been proposed and many of them require dedicated space to store the increasing amount of historical data, and therefore, they are not suitable for IoT or mobile applications. Besides, conventional IL schemes can not provide satisfying performance when historical data are not available. In this article, we address the IL problem in NDI from a new perspective, first, we provide a new metric to measure the degree of topological maturity of DNN models from the degree of conflict of class-specific fingerprints. We discover that an important cause for performance degradation in IL-enabled NDI is owing to the conflict of devices' fingerprints. Second, we also show that the conventional IL schemes can lead to low topological maturity of DNN models in NDI systems. Thirdly, we propose a new channel separation-enabled IL (CSIL) scheme without using historical data, in which our strategy can automatically separate devices' fingerprints in different learning stages and avoid potential conflict. Finally, We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real data from automatic-dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), an application of IoT in aviation.

Over the past couple of decades, the internet has grown to such an extent that almost every individual living on this planet has the access to the internet today. This can be viewed as one of the major achievements in the human race, but on the flip side of the coin, this gave rise to a lot of security issues for every individual or the company that is accessing the web through the internet. Hackers have become active and are always monitoring the networks to grab every possible opportunity to attack a system and make the best fortune out of its vulnerabilities. To safeguard people’s and organization’s privacy in this cyberspace, different network intrusion detection systems have been developed to detect the hacker’s presence in the networks. These systems fall under signature based and anomaly based intrusion detection systems. This paper deals with using anomaly based intrusion detection technique to develop an automation system to both train and test supervised machine learning models, which is developed to classify real time network traffic as to whether it is malicious or not. Currently the best models by considering both detection success rate and the false positives rate are Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) followed by Support Vector Machines(SVM). In this paper, it is verified that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based machine learning with wrapper feature selection outperforms support vector machine (SVM) technique while classifying network traffic as harmful or harmless. Initially to evaluate the performance of the system, NSL-KDD dataset is used to train and test the SVM and ANN models and finally classify real time network traffic using these models. This system can be used to carry out model building automatically on the new datasets and also for classifying the behaviour of the provided dataset without having to code. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The new UN vehicle regulation 155 on cybersecurity provisions for vehicle type approval, as part of the 1958 agreement on vehicle harmonization, mandates the use of risk assessment to mitigate cybersecurity risks and is expected to be adopted into national laws in 54 countries within 1 to 3 years. This new legislation will also apply to autonomous vehicles. The automotive cybersecurity engineering standard ISO/SAE 21434 is seen as a way to fulfill the new UN legislation, so we can expect quick and wide industry adoption. One risk assessment model that has gained some popularity and is in active use in several companies is the HEAVENS model, but since ISO/SAE 21434 introduces additional requirements on the risk assessment process, the original HEAVENS model does not fulfill the standard. In this paper, we investigate the gap between the HEAVENS risk assessment model and ISO/SAE 21434, and we identify and propose 12 model updates to HEAVENS to close this gap. We also discuss identified weaknesses of the HEAVENS risk assessment model and propose 5 additional model updates to overcome them. In accordance with these 17 identified model updates, we propose HEAVENS 2.0, a new risk assessment model based on HEAVENS which is fully compliant with ISO/SAE 21434. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120943316

This study proposes a zero-shot hybrid approach, combining a clustering algorithm with a method for representing category labels, to classify fine-grained entity typing based on unified cybersecurity ontology (UCO) to address this issue. However, certain category labels in UCO do not have distinct domain features, while certain abbreviations cannot be obtained directly from word embedding using Word2vec. Thus, we propose a new method, referred to as mixed entities and hierarchy of UCO (MEHC), to represent the category labels. Moreover, to further improve the performance of fine-grained entity typing we propose the triClustering algorithm to re-cluster coarse-grained classification results or determine corresponding types for new entities, based on the theorem that the sum of two sides of a triangle is greater than the third. The experimental results prove that our triClustering algorithm can effectively shorten the computation time and that the proposed hybrid method is superior to other baselines for information security applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115635724

Proactive defense has a number of significant advantages, which allow to overcome the fundamental limitations which are inherent to traditional reactive methods.

In this regard, the article discusses the issues of analysis and modeling attack prevention subsystems of operational cybersecurity centers. The cyber security operational center is a crucial component of a modern security infrastructure, which, at the same time, demonstrates basic properties of a protected object. Therefore it is selected as an example of a protected object. The research substantiates the effectiveness of proactive defense system and describes its echelons. The structural model is presented for operational cybersecurity center's threat prevention subsystem. The threat prevention subsystem's functional components' roles are described. On the basis of a model with full overlap and fuzzy indicators, a mathematical model of the threat prevention subsystem of the operational cybersecurity center is presented.

This new strategy is motivated by the fact that existing defenses almost always lag behind numerous emerging DDoS threats and evolving intelligent attack strategies. The root cause is if adversaries are smart and adaptive, no single-hop defenses (including optimal ones) can perfectly differentiate unknown DDoS and legitimate traffic. Instead, we formulate intelligent DDoS as a game between attackers and defenders, and prove how multi-hop traffic divergence helps bypass this dilemma by reversing the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. This insight results in EID, an Economical Intelligent DDoS Demotivation protocol. EID combines local weak (yet divergent) filters to provably null attack gains without knowing exploited vulnerabilities or attack strategies. It incentivizes multi-hop defenders to cooperate with boosted local service availability. EID is resilient to traffic dynamics and manipulations. It is readily deployable with random-drop filters in real networks today.

We first develop a series of attack algorithms to subvert perceptual hashing based image search. This is done by generating attack images that effectively enlarge the hash distance to the original image while introducing minimal visual changes. To make the attack practical, we design the attack algorithms under a black-box setting, augmented with novel designs (e.g., grayscale initialization) to improve the attack efficiency and transferability. We then evaluate our attack against the standard pHash as well as its robust variant using three different datasets. After confirming the attack effectiveness experimentally, we then empirically test against real-world reverse image search engines including TinEye, Google, Microsoft Bing, and Yandex.

TIA Portal is a popular software system for organizing the ICS, with which configuration and programming data can be viewed, changed and deleted. By saving the single project datasets historically, old versions of the current system configurations can be restored. In this initial work, we propose heuristics that detect anomalies in the TIA Portal data. In particular do we analyze the historical modifications within TIA Portal data by investigating long-term backups. Our approach covers both, changes to the data caused by infiltrated attacks as well as malicious changes made by employees who have direct access to the machines.

ML algorithms can examine the threats and respond to intrusions and security incidents swiftly in an instinctive way. It plays a critical function in providing a proactive security mechanism in the cybersecurity domain. Cybersecurity ensures the real time protection of information, information systems, and networks from intruders. Several security and privacy reports have cited that there has been a rapid increase in both the frequency and the number of cybersecurity breaches in the last decade. Information security has been compromised by intruders at an alarming rate. Anomaly detection, phishing page identification, software vulnerability diagnosis, malware identification, and denial of services attacks are the main cyber-security issues that demand effective solutions. Researchers and experts have been practicing different approaches to address the current cybersecurity issues and challenges. However, in this research endeavor, our objective is to make an idealness assessment of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) under the hesitant fuzzy (HF) conditions, using a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal-solutions (TOPSIS). Hesitant fuzzy sets are useful for addressing decision-making situations in which experts must overcome the reluctance to make a conclusion. The proposed research project would assist the machine learning practitioners and cybersecurity specialists in identifying, selecting, and prioritizing cybersecurity-related attributes for intrusion detection systems, and build more ideal and effective intrusion detection systems. © 2021 by the authors.

However, online application use by adolescents, especially mobile technology, has caused uneasiness among parents owing to cyber grooming incidents. This study reflects on the current cyber grooming situation. Investigating the current state of online grooming and the means through which parents can ensure the online safety of their adolescents from adults offering “candy” or wanting to start a relationship is necessary. Teen behavior related scholars believe that parents play a vital role in building safe environments. We conducted a qualitative study by interviewing 19 parents with children between the ages of 13 and 17 years in an urban setting to determine the level of the parents' awareness. Interviews were conducted based on five key components, namely, social media, unknown friends, sex education, private chats, and family time. The results present the actual situations of the parents and highlight related challenges as well as adolescents' ignorance and vulnerability to cyber grooming. Results are mapped to three main determinants of cyber grooming, namely, parental factors, self-efficacy, and self-regulation. We conclude with insights and recommendations for parents, schools, and the government to be vigilant for online predators by increasing awareness of cyber grooming.

The smart grid is based on combining ICT with the processing capabilities of computers and electrical systems to increase communication between users. However, smart grids are exposed to a variety of malicious cyber-attacks that can lead to the destruction of basic infrastructure and disrupt communication between the grid and users. Meanwhile, by authenticating the authenticated users, cyber-security can be created in the smart grid. One of the main components of a smart power grid is smart meters. However, to maintain security in a communication, smart meter authentication alone is not enough and it must be ensured that the electricity company's server is not forgery. Therefore, there is a need for two-way authentication between the smart meter on the home side and the electricity company server. The present work provides a key management layout (based on the elliptic curve cryptography) with two-way authentication for communication outside the home area network The proposed solution is two-way authentication among the smart meter and the security associate in the power company. In other words, the proposed methodology creates a solution to establish a connection between valid users and the smart grid. The proposed protocol evaluates the behavior of cyber-attacks on the smart grid. Attacks such as man-in the middle attacks and retransmission attacks are considered. It was found that, the proposed methodology improves the reliance between smart grid and authenticated users with the increase of secure communications. Moreover, the proposed protocol can prevent an extensive experiment attack. The results also showed that, as the false factor increases, the detection time by the proposed algorithm increases. As the false factor increases from 0.1 to 0.3, the detection time increases by 1.4 s. © 2021 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119976567

Even though the benefits of relying on information systems to run everyday tasks, organise one's business, interact with each other or enjoy public services are undisputable, the increasing use of digital technologies comes with a price: the growing exposure to cyber risks. This new type of threat has been in the center of the EU agenda for over 15 years during which a solid legislative framework for the protection S of network and information systems against cyber incidents has been developed. However, security and resilience of infrastructures and networks is one parameter of the challenge. Dealing with the financial risk emerging from a cyber incident, is another, equally important one. The need to mitigate these risks led to the emergence of a new insurance market, the cyber insurance market. Despite though the constantly growing demand for this type of insurance coverage, the market is still under development. The fast-evolving nature of cyber threats, the lack of a common language as regards risks, losses and coverages and the lack of historical data on cyber incidents are listed among the factors that slow down the market's growth. Currently, all involved stakeholders in the insurance field are considering specific initiatives that would accelerate the process of turning the EU market more competitive and efficient against its many challenges. The example of the US cyber insurance market, with its shortcomings and know-how, could also contribute to this effort, as an example of a market that has been intensively facing these challenges for almost twenty years. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119690320

Thus, there is a need to investigate the existing barriers to EDUC4 implementation. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a systematic literature review of journal articles in the Scopus database was conducted. Of the 299 journal articles generated from the initial search on Scopus, 30 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The content analysis yielded 12 barriers which include cybersecurity threat, costly, skills gap of human capital, apprehensive stakeholders, lack of training resources, lack of collaboration, knowledge gap for the customization of curriculum design, insufficient available technologies, health issues, time constraint for material preparation, complexity of learning platforms, and insufficient foundation of basic education. They were then associated with seven themes for better operationalization in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs): (1) human resources, (2) infrastructure, (3) financial, (4) linkages, (5) educational management, (6) learners, and (7) health and environment. Finally, a theoretical predictive model was constructed to present the causal relationships in modeling the problems associated with implementing EDUC4.

Much less attention has been given during this period to an equally important question: what constitutes cyber peace? This article draws on the literatures in peace and conflict studies and on desecuritization in critical security studies, to suggest how we might begin to rearticulate the cybersecurity narrative and shift the debate away from securitization and cyberwar to a more academically grounded focus on desecuritization and cyber peace. It is argued that such a move away from a vicious circle where states frame cybersecurity predominantly within a national security narrative and where they seek to perpetually prepare for cyberwar, to a virtual cycle of positive cyber peace, is not only a desirable, but a necessary outcome going forward.

The main expected benefit of the framework is to reduce time and cost needed to verify and validate automated systems with respect to safety, cyber-security, and privacy requirements. This is done through identification and classification of evaluation methods, tools, environments and concepts for V&V of automated systems with respect to the mentioned requirements.

Understanding how cybersecurity impacts the development of telehealth strategies is crucial for creating secure systems for daily operations. In the application reported in this article, the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) translated the complexity of cybersecurity in telehealth services into intelligible and objective results in an expert-based cognitive map. The tool also allowed the construction of scenarios simulating the possible implications caused by common factors that affect telehealth systems. FCMs provide a better understanding of cybersecurity strategies using expert knowledge and scenario analysis, enabling the maturation of cybersecurity in telehealth services. © 2021 by the authors.

A cybersecurity expert has an in-depth knowledge of technology but is often also recognized for the ability to view technology in a non-standard way. This paper explores how CS specialists are both a combination of professional computing-based skills and genetically encoded traits. Almost every human behavioral trait is a result of many genome variants in action altogether with environmental factors. The review focuses on contextualizing the behavior genetics aspects in the application of cybersecurity. It reconsiders methods that help to identify aspects of human behavior from the genetic information. And stress is an illustrative factor to start the discussion within the community on what methodology should be used in an ethical way to approach those questions. CS positions are considered stressful due to the complexity of the domain and the social impact it can have in cases of failure. An individual risk profile could be created combining known genome variants linked to a trait of particular behavior using a special biostatistical approach such as a polygenic score. These revised advancements bring challenging possibilities in the applications of human behavior genetics and CS. © 2021 by the authors.

SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries’ SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs’ management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs’ lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact, versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of MLCS. UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the same future path. © 2021 by the authors.

The core component of the IoT ecosystem is data which exists in various forms and formats. The collected data is then later used to create context awareness and make meaningful decisions. Besides an undoubtedly large number of advantages from the usage of IoT, there exist numerous challenges attributed to the security of objects that cannot be neglected for uninterrupted services. The Mirai botnet attack demonstrated that the IoT system is susceptible to different forms of cyberattacks. While advanced data analytics and Machine Learning have proved efficiency in various applications of cybersecurity, those still have not been explored enough in the literature from the applicability perspective in the domain of resource-constrained IoT. Several architectures and frameworks have been proposed for defining the ways for analyzing the data, yet mostly investigating off-chip analysis. In this contribution, we show how an Artificial Neural Network model can be trained and deployed on trivial IoT nodes for detecting intelligent similarity-based network attacks. This article proposes a concept of the resource-constrained intelligent system as a part of the IoT infrastructure to be able to harden the cybersecurity on microcontrollers.

This is because these systems are composed of various network protocols, various devices, and open technologies.

In recent times, phishing websites have emerged as a major cybersecurity threat. Phishing websites are fake web pages that are created by hackers to mimic the web pages of real websites to deceive people and steal their private information, such as account usernames and passwords. Accurate detection of phishing websites is a challenging problem because it depends on several dynamic factors. Ensemble methods are considered the state-of-the-art solution for many classification tasks. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of several separate classifiers to obtain a higher performance than a single classifier. This paper proposes an intelligent ensemble learning approach for phishing website detection based on weighted soft voting to enhance the detection of phishing websites. First, a base classifier consisting of four heterogeneous machine-learning algorithms was utilized to classify the websites as phishing or legitimate websites. Second, a novel weighted soft voting method based on Kappa statistics was employed to assign greater weights of influence to stronger base learners and lower weights of influence to weaker base learners, and then integrate the results of each classifier based on the soft weighted voting to differentiate between phishing websites and legitimate websites. The experiments were conducted using the publicly available phishing website dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which consists of 4898 phishing websites and 6157 legitimate websites. The experimental results showed that the suggested intelligent approach for phishing website detection out-performed the base classifiers and soft voting method and achieved the highest accuracy of 95% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.8%. © 2021 by the author.

Perhaps additive manufacturing (AM) supply chains possess higher degrees of threats than other supply chains due to their heavy dependence on technology and information sharing. Therefore, an assessment of the cyber resilience of an additive manufacturing (AM) supply chain is a crucial task to make the AM supply chain safe from the cyber intrusion and to secure competitive business advantages. Consequently, it is essential to develop a strategic decision-making framework to address the vulnerabilities associated with the AM supply chain. The assessment process involves various information sources that are incomplete, subjective, and also uncertain in type. Therefore, to handle the incomplete, uncertain, and subjective nature of the data, in this study, a data fusion technique named hierarchical evidential reasoning-based approach has been adopted. This study proposes an integrated and comprehensive approach based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory as a methodology of developing a framework for assessing the cyber resilience of an additive manufacturing supply chain. A case study involving an additive manufacturing organization was selected to test the proposed methodology. The output of the proposed framework shows reasonable results as an index of cyber resilience of additive manufacturing supply chain considering the amount of uncertainty or unassigned data associated with the measure of belief. Later, Yager's recursive rule of combination is applied to validate the output of the D-S theory. An index value was generated regarding the organization's cyber resilience state; it depicts a numerical measure of how resilient the organization is.

To fully benefit from the Internet of Things “IoT” system’s capabilities, the validity and accuracy of transmitted data should be ensured. Due to the constrained environment of IoT devices, practical security implementation presents a great challenge. In this paper, we present a noise-resilient, low-overhead, lightweight steganography solution adequate for use in the IoT environment. The accuracy of hidden data is tested against corruption using multiple modulations and coding schemes (MCSs). Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is added to the modulated data to simulate the noisy channel as well as several wireless technologies such as cellular, WiFi, and vehicular communications that are used between communicating IoT devices. The presented scheme is capable of hiding a high payload in audio signals (e.g., speech and music) with a low bit error rate (BER), high undetectability, low complexity, and low perceptibility. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using well-established performance evaluation techniques and has been demonstrated to be a practical candidate for the mass deployment of IoT devices. © 2021 by the author.

Since the State Estimator (SE) plays a critical role in power grid operation, special attention has been paid to its cyber vulnerabilities. Especially, a class of cyber attacks to this module, the so called False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) has received attention. So far, various methods to perform an FDIA on the SE have been proposed in the literature. There are also other researches suggesting different FDIA detection methods. However, such detection methods do not typically provide a mechanism to recover the true values of the attacked grid variables. In this paper, an iterative optimization-based approach is proposed to recover the pre-attack values of the attacked grid variables while trying to make as few changes to the non-attacked ones as possible. Furthermore, a framework to calculate an index called the Recovery Quality Index (RQI) is proposed to assess the performance of the recovery algorithm.

At the end of 2015, more than 20 billion machines and devices were connected to the Internet, with an expected growth to half a trillion by 2030. The most important raw material for this digital revolution is data, which when properly stored, analyzed and secured, constitute the basis for the development of any business. In times of rapid industrial development, automation of production processes and systems integration via networks, the effective protection of the cyber-physical systems of a plant is particularly important. To minimize the risks associated with Internet access, one must define all the possible threats and determine their sources in the plant and block or minimize the possibility of sabotage or data loss. This article analyzes the security measures used in industrial systems. In particular, risk management and the study of the risk sources in terms of human, hardware and software aspects in networked PLC and SCADA systems are discussed. Methods of improving the architecture of industrial networks and their management are proposed in order to increase the level of security.

The connected dimension of CAV provides for the vehicle to communicate with other vehicles and local infrastructure to operate in a safe manner. Yet, it is this communication of data and operation through software which causes potential problems in the event of the software suffering from unlawful modification (hacking). The consequences of a CAV being hacked could result in its features being compromised resulting in accidents, damage, financial loss, deaths and personal injury. It is also likely that hacking will affect fleets of vehicles operating on the same software version rather than individual vehicles. In this paper we argue there is a need for a strategy to determine how responsibility for the damage and loss caused following the mass hacking of CAVs is to be apportioned.

Network attacks refer to all types of unauthorized access to a network including any attempts to damage and disrupt the net-work, often leading to serious consequences. Network attack detection is an active area of research in the community of cybersecurity. In the literature, there are various descriptions of network attack detection systems involving various intelligent‐based techniques including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. However, although such techniques have proved useful within specific domains, no technique has proved useful in mitigating all kinds of network attacks. This is because some intelligent‐based approaches lack essential capabilities that render them reliable systems that are able to confront different types of network attacks. This was the main motivation be-hind this research, which evaluates contemporary intelligent‐based research directions to address the gap that still exists in the field.

Nowadays, populations of engineered bacteria can be remotely controlled to perform some medical actions on-demand; however, it brings crucial concerns from the cybersecurity perspective. As an example, one of the first cyberbioattacks has been recently proposed to explore the feasibility of using engineered bacteria to produce a Distributed Denial-of-Service and disrupt the creation of biofilm, a natural protection of bacteria against external agents. With the goal of mitigating the impact of this cyberbioattack, this paper proposes two novel mitigation mechanisms: quorum quenching and amplification. On the one hand, quorum quenching focuses on emitting molecules to block those sent by the cyberbioattack. On the other hand, the amplification approach emits molecules to increase the percentage of those needed to create the biofilm structure. To measure the performance of both mitigation techniques in dynamic scenarios, we have implemented different configurations of the Distributed Denial-of-Service attack and evaluated the channel attenuation and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR). As a result, we have observed that both approaches reduce the impact caused by the cyberbioattack, detecting differences between them. The quorum quenching mechanism presented better results, although it did not adapt its behavior to different attack configurations, responding statically. In contrast, the amplitude mitigation technique is perfectly adapted to attack configurations with different impacts on biofilm creation. © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115998247

Future highly automated vehicles (HAVs) will have to be updated periodically to continuously improve them and to keep up with the enormous development speed of the entire automated driving (AD) ecosystem. The updating process as well as the high connectivity of HAVs lead to a high risk of cybersecurity attacks through all kinds of internal and external electrical interfaces. Through such attacks, information could be stolen or, even worse, the control over vehicles could be assumed. Hence, security directly influences safety of vehicles. Attacks must be mitigated during all stages of the vehicle’s life cycle, including development, operation, maintenance, and disposal, to reduce security risks and, consequently, safety risks. Currently, there is no well-defined and officially accepted approach to combine safety and cybersecurity activities. Both the standards for functional safety and cybersecurity have to be met and taken into account accordingly during the (development) processes. In this paper, well-known safety and security methods in the automotive sector are summarized. Safety and cybersecurity co-analysis and co-design methods are outlined for the automotive sector with a focus on HAVs. Furthermore, these safety, cybersecurity, and co-engineering methods are evaluated in practice using a real vehicle and the first results are shown. The examined vehicle is the mobile test platform SPIDER. This platform enables the testing of components and vehicle functions in real-world situations and under harsh environmental conditions, which is a prerequisite to ensure safety. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115882921

The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model was modified to include perceived cyber security risk, perceived cyber security trust, and perceived overall cyber security. Unlike similar studies which have been solely quantitative, this research brings further insight using a mixed-methods approach which harnesses both qualitative and quantitative data. The research model was tested using partial-least-squares structural equation modelling on coded questionnaire data, collected from 191 participants. Qualitative data was analysed through a thematic analysis. Both sets of data were analysed using a final convergent mixed-method.

As a result of the volume of information and the necessity to deal with a security incident investigation promptly, different forensic tools have been developed to provide cyber threat intelligence and security incident response management platforms and solutions. These platforms enable responders to effectively collaborate in identifying and investigating incidents, manage their work on a case from creation until resolution or completion, and automate incident response tasks with the external threat information. Since incident response services are a growing priority at organizations, there is a pressing need for a trustworthy and transparent way to maintain the authenticity and integrity of investigative actions that is independently verifiable. Generally, security incident case management allows a security analyst to add related logs. Asides from the possibility of a log being deleted, it is difficult to audit the log for traceability and provenance if a user decides to be malicious. To address this problem, we propose utilizing a blockchain ledger for security investigative actions and associated metadata by extracting requirements for cybersecurity incident response from the models gathered through the analysis of an open-source incident management platform.

Manual vulnerability assessment practices result in inaccurate data and induce complex analytical reasoning. Contemporary security repositories’ diversity, incompleteness and redundancy contribute to such security concerns. These issues are typical characteristics of public and manufacturer vulnerability reports, which exacerbate direct analysis to root out security deficiencies. Recent advances in machine learning techniques promise novel approaches to overcome these notorious diversity and incompleteness issues across massively increasing vulnerability reports corpora. Yet, these techniques themselves exhibit varying degrees of performance as a result of their diverse methods. We propose a cognitive cybersecurity approach that empowers human cognitive capital along two dimensions. We first resolve conflicting vulnerability reports and preprocess embedded security indicators into reliable data sets. Then, we use these data sets as a base for our proposed ensemble meta-classifier methods that fuse machine learning techniques to improve the predictive accuracy over individual machine learning algorithms. The application and implication of this methodology in the context of vulnerability analysis of computer systems are yet to unfold the full extent of its potential. The proposed cognitive security methodology in this paper is shown to improve performances when addressing the above-mentioned incompleteness and diversity issues across cybersecurity alert repositories.

This study develops a systematic framework to delineate and analyze the strategies that governments and corporations take to address cybersecurity risks from digital trade. It maps out the current landscape based on a collection of 75 cases where governments and corporations interact to govern transnational cybersecurity risks. This study reveals that: first, governing cybersecurity risks from digital trade is a global issue whereby most governments implement policies with concerning that the cybersecurity risks embedded within purchasing transnational digital products can influence their domestic political and societal systems. Second, governments dominates the governance interactions by implementing trade policies whereas corporations simply comply. Corporations do, however, have chances to take more active roles in constructing the governance system. Third, supply chain cybersecurity risks have more significant impacts on governance mode between governments and corporations whereas concerns on different national cybersecurity risks do not. Fourth, the interactions between governments and corporations reveal the exisitence of loops that can amplify or reduce cybersecurity risks.

Some individuals experience longer asymptomatic periods while others acute worsening periods and/or exacerbations triggered by symptom multiplication factors. Medications are adjusted to the patients’ respiratory function, self-assessment of health and emerging certain physical changes. A more effective treatment may be applied by real-time data registered during the patient’s everyday life. Aim and methods: Introducing new modern digital technology in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) to help tracking the patients’ medication, thus we systematically reviewed the latest publications on telemedicine and pulmonary telerehabilitation. Conclusion: The use of the latest digital technologies in PR is very exciting and offers great opportunities while treating patients affected by specific conditions. On the one hand, adherence to medication can be improved in patients with chronic respiratory diseases by using these new state of the art devices; on the other hand, digital devices will also be able to monitor various physiological parameters of patients during their usual everyday activities. Data can be stored on a smartphone and shared with the provider. Relying on this information, physicians will be able to tailor medications and dosage to the specific needs of individual patients. Telerehabilitation may be a sustainable solution to the growing burden of chronic respiratory disease worldwide. However, PR must keep its cornerstones, such as education and motivations, which are most successful when conducted in person. Many issues remain to be resolved in the future, e.g. cybersecurity while using smart devices since they offer unique opportunities for PR. © 2021, The Author(s).",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113873081

One such challenge Indiana University (IU) faced was how to accommodate the secure telecommunications needs of 130,000 faculty, staff, and students who would now be teaching, learning, doing research, and working from home. Some universities reflexively promoted virtual private network (VPN) use for all activities. Such an approach would have been unsustainable at IU, however, owing both to the licenses and resources needed for the sheer number of users and to the high-throughput applications on which they rely. Perhaps even worse, it would have increased the chances that the VPN would be unavailable during a critical incident or other situation in which secure communications must be guaranteed. Instead, IU launched an awareness campaign demonstrating exactly when VPN use is and isn't needed. In addition, network staff employed a VPN feature called split tunneling to reduce the load.

After offline training, the effective false data can be constructed in a timely fashion without system network information. The effectiveness of the proposed attack method is validated using the IEEE14 and IEEE118 systems, in which the constructed false data injection attack can evade the system residual detection with an average success rate over 90% under different levels of measuring errors. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112672202

We empirically test proposed hypotheses using data collected from executive-level managers of various firms and perform semi-structured interviews of six case sites as post hoc analysis. The results suggest that institutional pressures positively affect top managers’ perceptions of job security, breach risk, financial risk, transaction cost, and regulatory oversight.

To thwart mobile loafing, organizations often adopt formal controls that encompass rules and policies. These formal controls can serve as a phase-shifting event. Phase shifting is a process where individuals reevaluate and revise their perceptions of the regulation of deviant behaviors. Despite the importance of understanding this process, little research has examined the announcement of formal controls as an impetus for phase shifting. The primary objectives of this study were to induce a phase-shifting perception in an organizational setting and explore its determinants and moderating role in the context of mobile loafing. Design/methodology/approach: The authors proposed and tested a model using two-wave data collected from 231 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. To test the research hypotheses, they used covariance-based structural equation modeling and logistic regression. Findings: The authors found that peer's mobile loafing and neutralization positively influence mobile-loafing intention before and after the announcement of formal controls. This research also shows that the higher an employee's neutralization, the likelier they perceive the announcement of formal controls as phase shifting. Also, the authors found that the moderating effect of phase-shifting perceptions functions in such a way that the relationship between T1 and T2 mobile-loafing intention is weaker when employees perceive the announcement of formal controls as a phase-shifting event. Practical implications: The authors’ results provide managers with useful insights into effectively using formal controls to mitigate employees' deviant behavior. To effectively use formal controls, managers should articulate formal controls that can trigger employees to revise their perceptions of counterproductive workplace behavior policies. Originality/value: This study is one of the first in information systems research to empirically examine the announcement of formal controls as a phase-shifting event and explore its antecedents and moderating role in the context of deviant workplace behavior in general and mobile loafing in particular. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109292025

Different components such as distributed generators and electric vehicles are deployed in large numbers. In order to cope with their impact on the grid operation, more granular observation is an absolute need. More phasor measurement units (PMUs) are utilized to be the eyes of grid operators on the infrastructure. Traditionally, PMU messages are not equipped with security features and are prone to cyber-attacks. Considering that they carry very sensitive information, repercussions of a potential attack could be very high. In order to address this need, IEC 61850-90-5 has been published recently. This standard introduces new messages, R-GOOSE and R-SV, for PMU communication networks and stipulates use of certain encryption and integrity algorithms. In order to reduce the risk of reverse engineering, these algorithms need an additional input called initialization vector (IV) that is used in calculations. Despite its indispensability for the above-mentioned algorithms, IEC 61850-90-5 does not have any mechanism for use and transfer of this value. In other words, without a viable solution for IV use, the proposed cybersecurity features of this standard cannot be utilized. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new field in R-GOOSE and R-SV messages. Custom-made emulators are utilized to exchange these messages with and without the proposed changes. Lab results show the implementation details and the fact that proposed solution addresses the above-mentioned problem with very little impact on the message sizes and End to End delays. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107794005

User identity linkage, which aims to reveal the correspondence among different accounts across networks, has been regarded as a fundamental problem for user profiling, marketing, cybersecurity, and recommendation. Existing methods mainly address the prediction problem by utilizing profile, content, or structural features of users in symmetric ways. However, encouraged by online services, information from different social platforms may also be asymmetric, such as geo-locations and texts. It leads to an emerged challenge in aligning users with asymmetric information across networks. Instead of similarity evaluation applied in previous works, we formalize correlation between geo-locations and texts and propose a novel user identity linkage framework for matching users across networks. Moreover, our model can alleviate the label scarcity problem by introducing external text-location pairs.

Concretely, ANEMONE first leverages a graph neural network backbone encoder with multi-scale contrastive learning objectives to capture the pattern distribution of graph data by learning the agreements between instances at the patch and context levels concurrently.

Automobiles have gradually changed from a closed system to an open environment. Therefore, a variety of security threats and attack surfaces are emerging.

However, the threat analysis based on the traditional attack tree has the disadvantages of multiple subjective factors and low accuracy. In this article, we present an attack tree analysis method based on Microsoft's threat model and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). First, a hierarchical in-vehicle network model is proposed. Then, with the help of Microsoft's threat model, we identify the threats corresponding to the assets and construct a more comprehensive attack tree. Finally, for each threat attack sequence of the attack tree, the attack probability is calculated based on the FAHP. Furthermore, FAHP is compared with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and traditional methods.

The operation of security operation centers (SOCs) is the recommended best practice to which large and medium-size organizations rely for the detection, notification, and ultimately response to cybersecurity incidents. However, current SOCs face several issues, such as inferior defense against specific types of attacks, low-quality threat intelligence, low speed of response and low level of automation. In this paper, a comprehensive SOC is introduced to mitigate above mentioned issues of current SOCs. First, the SOC collects a wide variety of data including network traffic, server logs, security incidents logs. The collected data is preprocessed and stored in a big-data storage platform. Secondly, the SOC provides multi-perspective behavior analysis which can combine the detection performance of multiple behavior detectors. Different detectors can analyze different and specific types of attack based on the data on the big data storage platform. Besides, threat intelligence is collected accurately from unstructured open-source cyber threat intelligence reports by using deep learning model and is correlated with incidents detection to identify attacks rapidly. Finally, the SOC can uniformly manage and automatically respond the incidents identified from multi-perspective behavior analysis and threat intelligence. At the same time, visualization is adopted to reveal the cybersecurity situation of entire organizations or enterprise. The framework of the SOC is derived from the CERN design, and is customized to make it is practical and deployable for the Institute of High Energy Physics to discover, identify, understand, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents from a comprehensive perspective. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118983203

Various methods had been adopted to maintain network security, among which Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the most essential parts of cybersecurity to defense against sophisticated and ever-growing network attacks. A number of researchers have studied comprehensive datasets and effective approaches to build IDS. Machine learning models are also applied in IDS and obtained considerable results in building better network security system. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage IDS based on machine learning models RF and SVM optimized with Feature Selection algorithm CFS. We also conducted experiments on NSL-KDD benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the two-stage IDS, comparing against RF and SVM models respectively. The results demonstrated that our proposed two-stage IDS outperformed RF and SVM with an increase from 4.31% to 14.62% in Precision and a reduction of 93.84% in time than SVM. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119272212

The illumination of wavelength-specific visible light in conjunction with applied voltage modulates the bipolar switching behaviour. Here the control of current compliance is the key to enable the memory device work reversibly at different operating voltage (<10 V) windows. The “set”/“reset” voltages for RS obtained for different wavelengths (in the range of 300–700 nm) appear in between the “set”/“reset” voltages obtained under dark and white light illumination. Light wavelength adds up an extra control parameter in conventional memristor devices for the encryption/decryption of specific information offering better cybersecurity. The RS mechanism is suggested to be filamentary where the formation and the rupturing of conducting filament occur by the migration of defects (e.g. O vacancies and interstitial Zn atoms) under externally applied electric field.

A typical grid architecture results can vary significantly, depending on trends or changes in power, voltage, current, or consumption.

To this aim, this paper studies the efficacy of missing data imputation techniques for safeguarding intrusion classification systems against missing scores. To do this, a hybrid intrusion classification system is designed that comprises several advanced imputation techniques. To evaluate this intrusion classification framework, various incomplete scenarios have been simulated from data collected from a cyber-physical water system. In total, forty-four incomplete scenarios are considered throughout the experiments. The evaluation is conducted based on the classification accuracy and F-measure, as well as the root mean square error of the imputed data. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of the proposed intrusion classification system and find the best match missing data imputation technique for the sake of intrusion classification. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119492308

We also find that while knowledgeable about cybersecurity theory (e.g. passwords), their actual behaviours did not reflect best practice. We discuss the role of schools in cybersecurity education and how to best embed this content in the curriculum to maximise the engagement of students, including a focus on teaching about cybersecurity protective tools. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121700444

Mitigation of invalid reports is a serious concern of organisations running or using bug-bounty platforms as well as security researchers. Aims: In this work we aim to identify: (i) why some reports are considered as invalid? (ii) what are the characteristics of reports considered as invalid due to being out-of-scope? Method: We conducted an empirical study on disclosed invalid reports in HackerOne to examine the reasons these reports are marked as invalid and we found that out-of-scope is the leading reason. Since all out-of-scope reports were rejected according to the programs policy page we studied all programs policy pages in two major bug-bounty platforms to understand the characteristics of an out-of-scope report. We developed a generalised out-of-scope taxonomy model and we used our model to further analyse HackerOne out-of-scope reports to find the leading attributes of this model that contributes to the fate of these reports. Results: We identified out-of-scope followed by false-positive as two main reasons for a report to be deemed invalid. We found that the attribute of vulnerability type in our taxonomy model is the leading characteristic of out-of-scope reports. We also identified the top 9 out-of-interest vulnerability types according to policy pages. Conclusions: Our study can help bug-bounty platforms and researchers to better understand the nature of invalid reports. Our finding about the importance of vulnerability type in validating reports can be used to justify future works to develop automated classification techniques based on vulnerability types to better triage invalid reports. Our top 9 out-of-interest vulnerability types can be used as a blacklist to automatically classify possibly an out-of-scope report. Finally our generalised out-of-scope taxonomy model can guide organisations as a base model to create their policy page and tailor it as they need. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118743615

This is because people needed to use the online shopping quite frequently for safety measures by keeping social distancing and avoiding overcrowd. However, as much as online shopping was a positive solution for shoppers, online criminals saw this as an opportunity to defraud people using crimeware such as identity theft, cloning of bank cards, and electronic stealing of money. Crimeware can spread by way of viruses, Trojan horse programs, worms, spyware or adware. Due to Covid-19, a higher number of people needed to stay indoors more, hence the need for the use of online shopping to buy groceries and other necessary goods has greatly increased. This rapid increase of online shopping has led to more people prone to cybercrime. However, the effect of Covid-19 lockdown regulation on online shopping cybercrime, especially in the developing nations, where computer security literacy level is still low, remains a research issue that needs to be addressed. Hence, this study investigates the effects of Covid-19 on cybercrime in online shopping using Buffalo City as a case study.

Unfortunately, the success of these takedowns is mixed. Furthermore, very little is understood as to how botnets and malware delivery operations respond to takedown attempts. We present a comprehensive study of three malware delivery operations that were targeted for takedown in 2015-16 using global download metadata provided by Symantec. In summary, we found that: (1) Distributed delivery architectures were commonly used, indicating the need for better security hygiene and coordination by the (ab)used service providers. (2) A minority of malware binaries were responsible for the majority of download activity, suggesting that detecting these ""super binaries""would yield the most benefit to the security community. (3) The malware operations exhibited displacing and defiant behaviours following their respective takedown attempts. We argue that these ""predictable""behaviours could be factored into future takedown strategies. (4) The malware operations also exhibited previously undocumented behaviours, such as Dridex dropping competing brands of malware, or Dorkbot and Upatre heavily relying on upstream dropper malware.

This workshop is designed for those who want to learn more about some of the various techniques used and how they can be incorporated into the IT curriculum. Nearly 20 years ago, the National Academy of Sciences Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) recognized the importance of improvisation as tool to help IT practitioners become more creative. Creative problem-solving methodologies such as design thinking all tie into the use of improvisation. Companies such as Twitter, IDEO, and Google are using improvisation methods as a way of creating better collaborative teams and a work environment that says YES before NO. Improvisation training can help students and faculty to become better listeners, communicators, collaborators, innovators, and those who can better focus on the organization or team story and not their own story. © 2021 Owner/Author.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117500217

At the same time, the utilization of UAVs also raises serious security and safety concerns. Given a large number of UAV-related jobs to be created in the near future, it is pressing to educate and train current and next-generation cybersecurity professionals towards UAVs and their applications. However, there is a lack of education and training materials on UAV cybersecurity, especially for hands-on practice. In this paper, we propose a novel UAV cybersecurity laboratory platform (UCLP), which provides efficient and effective hands-on practice. UCLP offers not only a cost-effective UAV cybersecurity practice environment, but also a series of designed and pre-configured lab modules. UCLP adopts a plug-in based design and hence supporting flexible customization of existing and new lab modules. UCLP uses technical solutions to overcome non-technical limitations in UAV cybersecurity practice (e.g., regulations of UAV operations). Our evaluation results demonstrated the efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness of UCLP and indicated UCLP is promising to be integrated into the education and training of UAV, cybersecurity, and related fields. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117489022

From religion, public health campaigns, political ads, and most recently, cybersecurity, fear appeals are believed to be effective tools. However, this assumption is often grounded in intuition rather than evidence. We know little about the specific contexts within which fear appeals may or may not work. In this study, we begin to examine various components of a fear appeal within the context of password hygiene. A large-scale randomized controlled experiment was conducted with one control and three treatment groups: (1) fear only; (2) measures needed and the efficacy of such measures, and (3) fear combined with measures needed and the efficacy of such measures. The results suggest that the most effective way to employ a fear appeal within the cybersecurity domain is by ensuring that fear is not used on its own. Instead, it is important that information on the measures needed to address the threat and the efficacy of such measures is used in combination with information about the nature of the threat. Since many individuals that enter the information technology profession become the de facto security person, it is important for information technology education programs to distill in students the inadequacy of fear, on its own, in motivating secure actions. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117479855

A detailed analysis of the simulated traffic using large data processing technologies is presented. The advantage of this technology is that it allows you to show the features of the local structure of a complex signal and to reveal its various properties that are invisible in real time. In the field of wavelet transform, additional information is extracted using the representation in the time-frequency image of a signal that is not available in its original form. The expediency of creating a hybrid network traffic monitoring system based on wavelet analysis has been substantiated. The use of wavelet bases for solving this problem has a leading position. The choice of the optimal wavelet basis will increase the probability of detecting attacks. The combination of several wavelet bases can give a better result in detecting intrusions into computer networks compared to monitoring based on a single wavelet base. When considering different methods of wavelet analysis to solve this problem, not identical examples of simulating attacked network traffic are used. Simulated traffic consisting of a real trace of an attack can show the full effectiveness of this method.

In this paper, we present KDST (K-Anonymous Node Discovery Using Separation of Trust), a model that provides a methodology to have true anonymous path discovery. The model is based on the separation of trust, and thus exposing the client would require full compromise of the system.

At the same time, the vulnerabilities of these systems to cyber threats represent a remarkable issue to the safety of navigation. Therefore, the maritime community has raised the question of cybersecurity of navigation systems in recent years. This paper aims to analyse the vulnerabilities of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Electronic Chart Display Information System (ECDIS) and Automatic Identification System (AIS). The concepts of these systems were developed at a time when cybersecurity issues have not been among the top priorities. Open broadcasts, the absence of or limited existence of data encryption and authentication can be considered as their primary security weaknesses. Therefore, these systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The GPS as the data source of a ship’s position can relatively easily be jammed and/or spoofed, increasing the vulnerabilities of ECDIS and AIS. A systematic literature review was conducted for this article, supplemented by a SWOT analysis of the AIS service and particular case studies of recent cyber-attacks on these systems. The analysis of selected case studies confirmed that these systems could easily be spoofed and become a subject of data manipulation with significant consequences for the safety of navigation.

However, the digitalization of the Administration entails assuming the threats inherent to the virtual environment, and with these, the establishment of measures to guarantee the functioning of public services, especially in terms of quality and continuity. Despite the above, the continuous cyber-attacks suffered by Public Administrations highlight the vulnerability and shortcomings of the current legal system. In this respect, the cyber-attack suffered by the State Public Employment Service has become the latest major public crisis to set off alarm bells about the weaknesses and problems of the current system. The cyber-attack could have caused serious damage to citizens' right to data protection and, therefore, could generate an obligation for the Administration to pay compensation. Consequently, this paper aims to analyze whether the SEPE is liable for the abnormal functioning of its services following the cyber-attack suffered at the beginning of March 2021. © 2021, Iustel.

With the advancement of technology, malware have become more and more polymorphic. In the process of digital investigation, forensics always cannot get the entire file of the malware. For example, when conducting corporate cybersecurity forensics, because the limit length of network packages, packets capture tools established by different companies often fail to get the entire file. Otherwise, deleting files may also cause residues of malware segments. Because we even do not know which part the segment we get is, so, we cannot use much domain knowledge to do the detection. Therefore, this paper proposes to detect malwares according to very small binary fragments of PE files by using a CNN-based model. Datasets especially test set are often one of the most difficult problems in zero-day malware detection, because it means that the virus has never appeared before. In this paper, we collect the data by taking advantage of the differences in anti-virus tools at different time points. The experiments are performed on malwares of different lengths, positions, and combinations. Through experiments, we found that only a short segment is needed to achieve a relatively good accuracy. In the end, for a random piece of continuous malicious code, we achieved an accuracy of up to 0.86 when the length of continuous fragments is 60,000 bytes. For non-contiguous and unordered random pieces of malicious code, we get an accuracy of up to 0.83 using only 1024 bytes (1 KB) length fragments. And when using 60,000 bytes length fragment as the baseline, we can finally receive a 0.91 accuracy. © 2021 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119620531

Despite the fact that security solutions are growing progressively modern and stable, cyberattacks are still evolving and are at their extreme. The main reason is that conventional methods of malware detection fail. Cyber attackers are actively developing new ways to prevent defence programmes from infecting malware networks and servers. Most anti-malware and antivirus applications currently use signature-based detection to identify attacks, which is unsuccessful in detecting new threats. This is where Artificial Intelligence is most handy. The standardised models for threatened hunting and performance quantification from the start of hazard hunting to the end still allow methodological rigour and completeness to be studied remain undefined. The organised practise of hazard hunts seeks to disclose the presence of TTP in the field of detection that has not already been detected. In this study, a realistic and comprehensive model is outlined to detect attackers in six stages: aim, scale, equipment, planning, execution and input. This study describes Threat Hunting in an ecosystem as the constructive, analyst-driven scanning mechanism for attackers TTP. The model has been checked for real-world data sets using a variety of threats. The effectiveness and practicality of this research have been shown with and without a blueprint through danger hunts. In addition, the article presents an analysis of the concept of threat hunting based on data from Ukrainian electricity grid attacks in an online environment to highlight the effects of this model on threat hunting in a simulated environment. The findings of this analysis include an effective and repetitive way to search for and quantify honesty, coverage and rigour. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119507811

Moreover, the popularity of social media users is determined by followers and hence users resort to different wrong means to promote increased profile followers. Researchers has offered a lot of feasible solutions for social media applications. In this paper, the automatic detection of fake profiles has been proposed to identify fake Instagram profiles so that the social life of Instagram users is secure. The prediction of fake Instagram profiles is facilitated using supervised learning machine algorithms. Upon classification, fake profile IDs are stored in a data dictionary to further help the concerned authorities to take necessary actions against fraudulent social media profiles.

In general, insider attackers seek to theft or alter the organization data with intentions. As insider threats are more difficult to detect, still major issues are there. In this research, the machine learning (ML) approach is proposed to analyze and detect insider threats. This project focuses on detecting insiders by learning the behaviour of insider threats continuously. At first, the insider dataset is collected and pre-processed. The preprocessing step breaks the data into a granular level (i.e.) weekly, daily and hourly behaviour data. Then, this data is processed with feature extraction in which the required features including HTTP features, E-mail features, file features, and USB features are extracted from each data instance. These are the main feature categories and each category consists of several features that are useful in insider detection. Then, the features are fed into the Random Forest (RF) classifier, one of the best ML algorithms. Finally, the RF classifies data into insiders and normally based on the features. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed ML-based insider threat detection model in granular level works is more accurate. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119494773

These AI-based cybersecurity frameworks have commendable scalability about them and are able to detect malicious activities within the cyberspace in a prompter and more efficient manner than conventional security architectures. However, our one or two completed studies did not provide a complete and clear analyses to apply different machine learning algorithms on different media systems.

It is getting more difficult in the information age due to the explosion of data and technology. There is a drastic rise in the new types of attacks where the conventional signature-based systems cannot keep up with these attacks. Machine learning seems to be a solution to solve many problems, including problems in cyber security. It is proven to be a very useful tool in the evolution of malware detection systems. However, the security of AI-based malware detection models is fragile. With advancements in machine learning, attackers have found a way to work around such detection systems using an adversarial attack technique. Such attacks are targeted at the data level, at classifier models, and during the testing phase. These attacks tend to cause the classifier to misclassify the given input, which can be very harmful in real-time AI-based malware detection. This paper proposes a framework for generating the adversarial malware images and retraining the classification models to improve malware detection robustness. Different classification models were implemented for malware detection, and attacks were established using adversarial images to analyze the model’s behavior. The robustness of the models was improved by means of adversarial training, and better attack resistance is observed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

This study aims to measure the effectiveness of security practices at small-sized enterprises in Saudi Arabia in the event of a cybersecurity attack. Our paper is among the first research papers to measure the effectiveness of cybersecurity practices and the threat posed by cybersecurity breaches among small enterprises in the event of cybersecurity attacks. A total of 282 respondents participated, all of them representing small-sized enterprises in Saudi Arabia. The study applies multiple regression tests to analyze the effectiveness of 12 cybersecurity practices in three aspects: financial damage, loss of sensitive data, and restoration time, at small enterprises. The findings indicate that having an inspection team and a recovery plan may limit the financial damage caused by cybersecurity attacks on small enterprises. The results also show that cybersecurity awareness, knowledge of cybersecurity damage, and professionals’ salaries were related to the loss of sensitive data. Furthermore, the results indicate that contact with cybersecurity authorities and having an inspection team have statistically significant effects on restoration time. © 2021 by the authors.

However, this approach incurs significant hardware cost. Consequently, this paper aims to reduce security enhancing-related hardware cost by proposing two efficient design space exploration (DSE) algorithms, namely, stepwise decreasing-based heuristic algorithm (SDH) and interference balancing-based heuristic algorithm (IBH), which explore the task assignment, task scheduling, and message scheduling to minimize the number of required HSMs. Experiments on both synthetical and real data sets show that the proposed SDH and IBH are superior than state-of-the-art algorithm, and the advantage of SDH and IBH becomes more obvious as the increase about the percentage of security-critical tasks. For synthetic data sets, the hardware cost can be reduced by 61.4% and 45.6% averagely for IBH and SDH, respectively; for real data sets, the hardware cost can be reduced by 64.3% and 54.4% on average for IBH and SDH, respectively. Furthermore, IBH is better than SDH in most cases, and the runtime of IBH is two or three orders of magnitude smaller than SDH and state-of-the-art algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

Its consequences vary from political and societal to technical and economic. These side effects provided fertile ground for a noticeable cyber-crime increase targeting critical infrastructures and, more specifically, the health sector; the domain suffering the most during the pandemic. This paper aims to assess the cybersecurity culture readiness of hospitals’ workforce during the COVID-19 crisis. Towards that end, a cybersecurity awareness webinar was held in December 2020 targeting Greek Healthcare Institutions. Concepts of cybersecurity policies, standards, best practices, and solutions were addressed. Its effectiveness was evaluated via a two-step procedure. Firstly, an anonymous questionnaire was distributed at the end of the webinar and voluntarily answered by attendees to assess the comprehension level of the presented cybersecurity aspects. Secondly, a post-evaluation phishing campaign was conducted approximately four months after the webinar, addressing non-medical employees. The main goal was to identify security awareness weaknesses and assist in drafting targeted assessment campaigns specifically tailored to the health domain needs. This paper analyses in detail the results of the aforementioned approaches while also outlining the lessons learned along with the future scientific routes deriving from this research. © 2021 by the authors.

A security-question authentication model is proposed that builds on the strengths of security question responses, chiefly their ease of recall and higher entropy, while mitigating the core weaknesses of the model, which are the lack of uniform answers and public accessibility to answers. Users that were made aware of the entropy of their responses were more likely to provide stronger responses to the security questions without affecting the repeatability of the responses to the questions but negatively impacting the memorability.

The problem is particularly complex, since perpetrators of fraud could belong to any position, from top managers to payroll employees. Fraud detection has traditionally been performed by auditors, who mainly employ manual techniques. These could take too long to process fraud-related evidence. Data mining, machine learning, and, as of recently, deep learning strategies are being used to automate this type of processing. Many related techniques have been developed to analyze, detect, and prevent fraud-related behavior, with the fraud triangle associated with the classic auditing model being one of the most important of these. This work aims to review current work related to fraud detection that uses the fraud triangle in addition to machine learning and deep learning techniques. We used the Kitchenham methodology to analyze the research works related to fraud detection from the last decade. This review provides evidence that fraud is an area of active investigation. Several works related to fraud detection using machine learning techniques were identified without the evidence that they incorporated the fraud triangle as a method for more efficient analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, several countries have made huge investments in developing smart cities to offer sustainable living. However, there are some challenges to overcome in smart city development, such as traffic and transportation man-agement, energy and water distribution and management, air quality and waste management mon-itoring, etc. The capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help to achieve some goals of smart cities, and there are proven examples from some cities like Singapore, Copenhagen, etc. However, the adoption of AI and the IoT in developing countries has some chal-lenges. The analysis of challenges hindering the adoption of AI and the IoT are very limited. This study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing the causal relationships among the challenges in smart city development, and contains several parts that conclude the previous scholars’ work, as well as independent research and investigation, such as data collection and analysis based on DE-MATEL. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to extract key challenges for the adoption of AI and the IoT. These helped us to proceed with the investigation and analyze the adoption status. Therefore, using the PRISMA method, 10 challenges were identified from the literature review. Sub-sequently, determination of the causal inter-relationships among the key challenges based on expert opinions using DEMATEL is performed. This study explored the driving and dependent power of the challenges, and causal relationships between the barriers were established. The results of the study indicated that “lack of infrastructure (C1)”, ”insufficient funds (C2)”, “cybersecurity risks (C3)”, and “lack of trust in AI, IoT” are the causal factors that are slowing down the adoption of AI and IoT in smart city development. The inter-relationships between the various challenges are pre-sented using a network relationship map, cause–effect diagram. The study’s findings can help regulatory bodies, policymakers, and researchers to make better decisions to overcome the challenges for developing sustainable smart cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Insider threats represent a major cybersecurity challenge for private and public organizations, as an insider attack can cause extensive damage to organization assets much more than external attacks. Most existing approaches in the field of insider threat focused on detecting general insider attack scenarios. However, insider attacks can be carried out in different ways, and the most dangerous one is a data leakage attack that can be executed by a malicious insider before his/her leaving an organization. This paper proposes a machine learning‐based model for detecting such serious insider threat incidents. The proposed model addresses the possible bias of detection results that can occur due to an inappropriate encoding process by employing the feature scaling and one‐hot encoding techniques. Furthermore, the imbalance issue of the utilized dataset is also addressed utilizing the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Well known machine learning algorithms are employed to detect the most accurate classifier that can detect data leakage events executed by malicious insiders during the sensitive period before they leave an organization. We provide a proof of concept for our model by applying it on CMU‐CERT Insider Threat Dataset and comparing its performance with the ground truth. The experimental results show that our model detects insider data leakage events with an AUC‐ROC value of 0.99, outperforming the existing approaches that are validated on the same dataset. The proposed model provides effective methods to address possible bias and class imbalance issues for the aim of devising an effective insider data leakage detection system. © 2021 by the authors.

The main goal of this attack is to bring the targeted machine down and make their services unavailable to legal users. This can be accomplished mainly by directing many machines to send a very large number of packets toward the specified machine to consume its resources and stop it from working. We implemented a method using Java based on entropy and sequential probabilities ratio test (ESPRT) methods to identify malicious flows and their switch interfaces that aid them in passing through. Entropy (E) is the first technique, and the sequential probabilities ratio test (SPRT) is the second technique. The entropy method alone compares its results with a certain threshold in order to make a decision. The accuracy and F-scores for entropy results thus changed when the threshold values changed. Using both entropy and SPRT removed the uncertainty associated with the entropy threshold. The false positive rate was also reduced when combining both techniques. Entropy-based detection methods divide incoming traffic into groups of traffic that have the same size. The size of these groups is determined by a parameter called window size. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 1998, DARPA2000, and Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC-DDoS2019) databases were used to evaluate the implementation of this method. The metric of a confusion matrix was used to compare the ESPRT results with the results of other methods. The accuracy and f-scores for the DARPA 1998 dataset were 0.995 and 0.997, respectively, for the ESPRT method when the window size was set at 50 and 75 packets. The detection rate of ESPRT for the same dataset was 0.995 when the window size was set to 10 packets.

However, the traditional methods deeply rely on domain expert knowledge, which requires prohibitive labor and time costs. Autonomous penetration testing is a more efficient and intelligent way to solve this problem. In this paper, we model penetration testing as a Markov decision process problem and use reinforcement learning technology for autonomous penetration testing in large scale networks. We propose an improved deep Q-network (DQN) named NDSPI-DQN to address the sparse reward problem and large action space problem in large-scale scenarios. First, we reasonably integrate five extensions to DQN, including noisy nets, soft Q-learning, dueling architectures, prioritized experience replay, and intrinsic curiosity model to improve the exploration efficiency. Second, we decouple the action and split the estimators of the neural network to calculate two elements of action separately, so as to decrease the action space. Finally, the performance of algorithms is investigated in a range of scenarios.

Recently, detecting anomalies by deep neural networks has become a popular trend. Specially, context vector data description (CVDD) method shows the promising performance. However, CVDD has two limitations: (1) it uses an one-class classification objective to constrain the sentence embeddings, which leads the learned embeddings to lose content information of text. (2) Scalar-based attention weights, which are used to extract sentence features, fail to focus on dimensional properties in a word. Learning the text contents and the dimensional properties is important for detection task in SIoT, which can help detector capture the difference between normal and anomaly texts. To overcome these limits, this paper proposes a textual anomaly detection network. First, an adversarial training strategy is designed to fight against the problem of missing content information. Second, a textual anomaly detection module with multiple dimensional transformation matrices is constructed to learn dimensional properties of words in diverse semantic subspaces. Experimental results on several textual datasets show that our proposed method outperforms CVDD and other strong baselines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114608339

Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers - both of which are superior to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios - and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits a > 97% F-score. Overall, CAN-D is the only solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal that is also the state of the art. In evaluation on 10 vehicles of different makes, CAN-D's average $\ell ^1$ error is five times better (81% less) than all previous methods and exhibits lower average error, even when considering only signals that meet prior methods' assumptions. Finally, CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware, allowing for an on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112244066

Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed common data environment (DCDE) framework for BIM-based design leveraging two distributed technologies: blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The DCDE framework guarantees irreversible design changes storage using blockchain while secures design file storage using IPFS. A blockchain transaction data model and a smart contract are also developed within the framework to support DCDE functionalities. Lastly, framework applicability and performance are tested in an illustrative design example.

Governments have yet to find stable policy solutions to match potential cyber threats. The challenge then is to establish new global norms concerning acceptable behavior in cyberspace. This article analyzes the attempts to construct global cybersecurity norms. It differs from much of the existing literature on norm-construction since it moves beyond the interstate level to examine subnational groups and private sector actors that function as norm entrepreneurs in this policy area. The article posits that while nation states remain central, nonstate actors are playing an increasingly important role in cybersecurity norm-building, supplementing state action, and, to some degree, compensating for state inaction when cooperation reaches an impasse.

The commoditization of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) allows criminals to obtain financial benefits at a low risk and with little technical background. One such popular product is ransomware, which is a popular type of malware traded in the underground economy. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a ransom is paid to the criminals. In addition, a recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid before a given time, producing further economic and reputational damage. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of Avaddon, a ransomware offered in the underground economy as an affiliate program business. This threat has been linked to various cyberattacks and has infected and leaked data from at least 62 organizations. Additionally, it also runs Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against victims that do not pay the ransom. We first provide an analysis of the criminal business model in the underground economy. Then, we identify and describe its technical capabilities, dissecting details of its inner structure. As a result, we provide tools to assist analysis, decrypting and labeling obfuscated strings observed in the ransomware binary. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence of links between this variant and a previous family, suggesting that the same group was behind the development and, possibly, the operation of both campaigns. Finally, we develop a procedure to recover files encrypted by Avaddon. We successfully tested the proposed procedure against different versions of Avaddon.

This paper proposes a novel max-min integer programming model subject to a budget constraint to improve network connectivity of a compromised digital logistics network via a strategy of maximising algebraic connectivity. Due to the NP-hardness of the maximisation problem, the optimal solution may not be found quickly. Thus, several heuristic algorithms, including greedy algorithms, tabu search and relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) with rounding, are proposed.

Parallel several cybersecurity threats and phishing attacks have been encountered while accessing these websites. Accessing a malicious webpage can create serious harm to the physical system. Data loss, privacy breach, credential theft and many security threats are entered while an Internet user clicks a malicious URL. Several defence and detection strategies have been proposed in the previous research works. But, the works have used a traditional classifier which is not adequate. This is because the size of the URL is huge, and the URL patterns are changed over time so finding the correlation between old and new patterns is almost impossible. Hence, this paper proposed malicious URL detection using multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed model first considered one layer of CNN. After that, to improve the accuracy, a two-layer of CNN will be used. The achieved result illustrated that malicious website detection accuracy is enhanced 89% to 91% when the model uses two layers of CNN. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119442480

The assessment of financial fraud risks is a significant challenge for independent, external auditors chiefly when dealing with the audit in an information technology (IT) environment. A meta-analysis financial fraud risk governance model taking into account an IT environment and based on fuzzy inference system is proposed in this paper. The fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic are employed to deal with actual business audits, which do not always concern dichotomic fraud risk conditions.

This paper provides a brief overview of the IoT and cognitive capabilities of the Internet of Medical Things (CIoMT) and the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) for COVID-19. This paper focuses on the data acquisition phase of these applications, as it has the most constrained resources and sensors and is subjected to the challenge of heating as some sensors are directly attached to patients bodies. SIMON lightweight block cipher is used in this paper based on research conducted about the most published papers in Scopus discussing the use of lightweight cryptography to secure IoT and Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). SIMON has more papers than AES RC5, RC6, PRESENT, and CLEFIA combined. In these papers, SIMON subjected and proved reliance on various cryptanalysis, including linear, differential, impossible differential, zero-correlation linear, and rational-XOR. WBAN and IoT applications WBAN are subjected to various security and privacy attacks, combined with limited space and power resources. Therefore, we propose to use SIMON with various configurations written in VHDL, depending on the implementation context, to maintain the privacy of patients sensitive data and sustain the required confidentiality requirement of such applications. Thus, Xilinx Vivado 2021.1 was used for verifying, synthesizing, and simulating the various configurations, i.e., SIMON scalar 128/128, 64/128 and 32/64 designs, along with 64/128 outer round pipelined and 64/128 mixed round pipelined. Therefore, xc7z010clg400-1 SoC (Zybo) FPGA is used as the board, with a Zynq-7000 device as a reference to synthesize the designs, and the performance indicators in this paper are LUTs, frequency, IOBs, and throughput-to-slice (TP/slice). Moreover, the Cadence Genus tool is used to calculate estimated battery life, area, and gate count for the scalar designs based on the modified frequencies suitable for these applications, including RTL implementations and Joules power estimator using a Samsung 28nm process. Hence, at the data acquisition level, Simon 32/64 is selected as a preferred core for implementation. It is reasonably robust from a security perspective, while still looks like a reasonable compromise and a lot smaller than the 64/128 and 128/128 and has less wasted resources on all fronts. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119409747

Terrorists use cyber vulnerability as weapons for mass destruction. The dark web's strong transparency and hard-to-track systems offer a safe haven for criminal activity. On the dark web (DW), there is a wide variety of illicit material that is posted regularly. For supervised training, large-scale web pages are used in traditional DW categorization. However, new study is being hampered by the impossibility of gathering sufficiently illicit DW material and the time spent manually tagging web pages. We suggest a system for accurately classifying criminal activity on the DW in this article. Rather than depending on the vast DW training package, we used authorized regulatory to various types of illicit activity for training Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and get appreciable categorization results. Espionage, Sabotage, Electrical power grid, Propaganda and Economic disruption are the cyber warfare motivations and We choose appropriate data from the open source links for supervised Learning and run a categorization experiment on the illicit material obtained from the actual DW. The results shows that in the experimental setting, using TF-IDF function extraction and a AdaBoost classifier, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 0.942. Our method enables the researchers and System authoritarian agency to verify if their DW corpus includes such illicit activity depending on the applicable rules of the illicit categories they are interested in, allowing them to identify and track possible illicit websites in real time. Because broad training set and expert-supplied seed keywords are not required, this categorization approach offers another option for defining illicit activities on the DW. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119101433

However, information of all types can go through many servers and networks before reaching its intended destination and any of these has the potential to intercept or even manipulate the exchanged information if data's transfer is not adequately protected. As trust is a fundamental concept in healthcare relationships, it is crucial to offer a secure medical website to maintain the same level of trust as provided in a face-to-face meeting. This study provides a first analysis of the SSL/TLS security of and the security headers used within the health-related web limited to web pages in German, the German health web (GHW). Methods: testssl.sh and TLS-Scanner were used to analyze the URLs of the 1,000 top-ranked health-related web sites (according to PageRank) for each of the country- code top level domains: '.de', '.at' and '.ch'. Results: Our study revealed that most websites in the GHW are potentially vulnerable to common SSL/TLS security vulnerabilities, offer deprecated SSL/TLS protocol versions and mostly do not implement HTTP security headers at all. Conclusions: These findings question the concept of trust within the GHW. Website owners should reconsider the use of outdated SSL/TLS protocol versions for compatibility reasons. Additionally, HTTP security headers should be implemented more consequently to provide additional security aspects. In future work, the authors intend to repeat this study and to incorporate a website's category, i.e. governmental or public health, to get a more detailed view of the GHW's security. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116376796

However, the increased scrutiny that automated vehicles (AV) face over functional safety has hindered the industry's unbridled confidence in self-driving technologies. As AVs are cyber-physical systems, they utilize distributed control to accomplish a range of safety-critical driving tasks. The Operation Systems (OS) serve as the core of these control systems. Therefore, their designs and implementation must incorporate ways to protect AVs against what must be assumed to be inevitable cyberattacks to meet the overall AV functional safety requirements. This paper investigates the connection between functional safety and cybersecurity in the context of OS. This study finds that risks due to delays can worsen by potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities through a case example of an automated vehicle following.

We further examined the relationship between hospital data breaches and cybersecurity ratings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Fortune 1000 firms as a benchmark, time trends in hospital cybersecurity ratings were compared using linear regression. Further, the relationship between hospital data breaches and cybersecurity ratings was modeled using logistic regression. Hospital breach data were collected from US HHS, and cybersecurity ratings were provided by BitSight. The resulting study sample yielded 3528 hospital-year observations. RESULTS: In aggregate, we found that hospitals had significantly lower cybersecurity ratings than Fortune 1000 firms, however, hospitals have closed the gap in recent years. We also found that hospitals with the low security ratings were associated with significant risk of a data breach, with the probability of a breach in a given year ranging from 14% to 33%. DISCUSSION: Recent cyber-attacks in healthcare continue to illustrate the need to better secure information systems. While hospitals have reduced cyber risk over the past decade, they remain statistically more vulnerable than the Fortune 1000 firms against botnets, spam, and malware. CONCLUSION: Policy makers should continue encouraging acute-care hospitals to proactively invest in security controls that reduce cyber risk. Best practices from other sectors like the financial services sector could provide useful guides and benchmarks for improvement. © The Author(s) 2021.

This highlights the importance of detecting vehicle cyber attacks before fatal accidents occur. One natural method for tackling this problem is to adapt existing approaches for detecting attacks in enterprize networks, but which has achieved limited success. In this article, we propose a new approach to treat vehicles as cyber-physical-human systems, leading to a novel framework called exploiting human, physical and driving behaviors to detect vehicle cyber attacks (ExHPD). The framework has four detectors: 1) a human detector; 2) a physical behavior-based detector; 3) a driving behavior-based detector (DBD); and 4) an integrated physical and DBD. As the proof of concept, we recruited 50 drivers to conduct institutional review board-approved simulation-based driving tests. The experimental results show that ExHPD is effective to detect vehicle cyber attacks and avoid deadly crashes by offering drivers adequate time to safely pull over their compromised vehicle. The impact of driver's impulsiveness (one aspect of human factors) on the detectors' effectiveness and limitations of the present study are discussed.

To support automated driving functions, vehicles share information via wireless interfaces (e.g., cellular) with Other Road Users (ORUs). This growing degree of connectivity also increases the risk of cyberattacks. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulation authority (WP.29), the integration of security countermeasures (e.g., Intrusion Detection System (IDS)) is mandatory for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). To verify the effectiveness of such security measures for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) functions, aspects such as vehicle behavior, network communication and the environment have to be taken into account. The use of model-based simulation approaches enables an early virtual verification of electrical/electronic architectures (E/E architectures) before the associated hardware is completely developed. In this paper, we describe a multi-domain co-simulation approach for a scenario-driven and reactive testing of E/E architectures that form with their corresponding environment cyber-physical systems (CPSs). It is based on deriving simulation models from the established E/E architectures modeling tool PREEvision. Moreover, we show the development of an IDS by applying our simulation approach in a model-based manner and evaluate it with a pre-defined attack scenario. As a conclusion, we discuss how this approach can support identifying design flaws for developed countermeasures and help to improve or establish standards for model-based security testing of E/E architectures. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119093440

This paper presents a new approach to generate relevant attack paths in a semi-automated way, taking the attack motivation and functional dependencies into account. This can shift the effort of creating attack trees in the concept phase to the preliminary system description and allows cybersecurity experts to focus more on aspects that require their creativity and expertise. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119089989

Memory vulnerabilities in the embedded program code, such as buffer overflow, are the entry point for powerful attack paradigms such as Code-Reuse Attacks (CRAs), in which attackers corrupt systems' execution flow and maliciously alter their behavior. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) has been proven to be the most promising approach against such kinds of attacks, and in the literature, a wide range of flow monitors are proposed, both hardware-based and software-based. While the formers are hardly applicable as they impose design alteration of underlying hardware modules, on the contrary, software solutions are more flexible and also portable to the existing devices. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and their key role in application development for embedded systems is the main concern regarding the application of the CFI solutions.This paper discusses the still open challenges and issues regarding the implementation of control-flow integrity policies on operating systems for embedded systems, analyzing the solutions proposed so far in the literature, highlighting possible limits in terms of performance, applicability, and protection coverage, and proposing possible improvement directions. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119021625

In particular, we propose an intelligent grid shepherd for the smart grid controller in the power grid framework. That can autonomously detect the abnormal behavior of the received status message from each DER and apply control decisions into the smart grid controller. To do this, first, we propose a continuous-time Markov decision process problem by formulating a resilient control system for the intelligent grid shepherd. Second, we design a data-informed policy-based model-free reinforcement learning framework to find the optimal consensus policy for each DER control decision (i.e., remain connected with the main grid or disconnected). Thus, we devise a distributed energy resources control algorithm for the intelligent grid shepherd. Particularly, we design an advantage actor-critic scheme under the continuous-time domain with the shared neural network mechanism.

Many governments and businesses are addressing this urgent issue. IACS consists of two technologies, one is an information equipment based on information technology (IT) such as the Internet and cloud servers, and a control equipment based on operation technology (OT) such as controllers and sensing devices. The assets to be protected in IACS are not only IT information assets, as well as the functions and performance of OT related to human health and social services. For this reason, it has been known that the counter measures based on IT security alone are insufficient and incomplete. As an approach to this problem, IT/OT convergence has attracted attention in the IACS security problem. In order to bridge gaps of technical, human, and system gaps between IT and OT, new methodologies from the view of IT/OT convergence are being studied. This paper would discuss a security risk assessment for analyzing, designing counter measures and evaluating IACS security issues from the perspective of IT/OT convergence. Since the scope of assessment and the items to be examined will expand, we propose the extended risk assessment form that can take them into consideration.

However, it is also highly susceptible to security attacks like conventional network. Inspired from the success of different machine learning algorithms in other domains, many intrusion detection systems (IDS) are presented to identify attacks aiming to harm the network. In this paper, leveraging the flow-based nature of SDN, we introduce DeepFlowIDS, a deep learning (DL)-based approach for anomaly detection using the flow analysis method in SDN. Furthermore, instead of using a lot of network properties, we only utilize essential characteristics of traffic flows to analyze with deep neural networks in IDS. This is to reduce the computational and time cost of attack traffic detection. Besides, we also study the practical benefits of applying deep transfer learning from computer vision to intrusion detection. This method can inherit the knowledge of an effective DL model from other contexts to resolve another task in cybersecurity. Our DL-based IDSs are built and trained with the NSL-KDD and CICIDS2018 dataset in both fine-Tuning and feature extractor strategy of transfer learning. Then, it is integrated with the SDN controller to analyze traffic flows retrieved from OpenFlow statistics to recognize the anomaly action in the network. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

Extractor makes no strong assumptions about the text and is capable of extracting attack behaviors as provenance graphs from unstructured text. We evaluate Extractor using real-world incident reports from various sources as well as reports of DARPA adversarial engagements that involve several attack campaigns on various OS platforms of Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD.

Moreover, modern Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) used in the Operational Technology (OT) sector are adopting open-source operating systems such as Linux instead of proprietary software, making such devices susceptible to Linux-based malware. Traditional malware detection approaches cannot be applied directly or extended to such environments due to the unique restrictions of these PLC devices, such as limited computational power and real-time requirements.

We evaluate ORRIS against in-the-wild Linux malware achieving maximum detection accuracy of ≈99.7% with very few false-positive occurrences, a result comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial products.

Initially, the EU's introverted vision on the issue drove the policy to focus on cyber resilience and strategic autonomy. Evidently, the EU's strategic narrative that could assist it in leading the process of creating an open, free, stable and secure cyberspace in the digital decade, in the context of international security, is emerging. Thus, this contribution is to test the argument that the EU, utilizing an imperial paradigm (consciously or not), is gradually becoming a global steering power in cybersecurity. In this article, firstly, we identify and examine the process of formation of the EU's narratives about (its) cyber power. Secondly, we establish a discussion framework to highlight the methodological relevance of the imperial paradigm, cyber power Europe and Strategic Narrative Theory for a multidisciplinary debate on global geo-strategic redesign, in which the EU takes part. Thirdly, we look into bilateral and multilateral forums and processes that deal with cybersecurity and in which the EU participates, in order to understand more specifically how the EU is projecting its cyber-power narratives internationally and how cybersecurity-associated challenges impact current dynamics in other policy domains in the field of international relations. © 2021 University of Deusto.

Numerous vulnerable factors increase security risks and cyber-attacks, including viruses, the internet, communications, and hackers. Internets of Things (IoT) devices are more effective, and the number of devices connected to the internet is constantly increasing, and governments and businesses are also using these technologies to perform business activities effectively. However, the increasing uses of technologies also increase risks, such as password attacks, social engineering, and phishing attacks. Humans play a major role in the field of cybersecurity. It is observed that more than 39% of security risks are related to the human factor, and 95% of successful cyber-attacks are caused by human error, with most of them being insider threats. The major human factor issue in cybersecurity is a lack of user awareness of cyber threats. This study focuses on the human factor by surveying the vulnerabilities and reducing the risk by focusing on human nature and reacting to different situations. This study highlighted that most of the participants are not experienced with cybersecurity threats and how to protect their personal information. Moreover, the lack of awareness of the top three vulnerabilities related to the human factor in cybersecurity, such as phishing attacks, passwords, attacks, and social engineering, are major problems that need to be addressed and reduced through proper awareness and training. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

Since they have been successfully installed in the business activities and there is a requirement of advanced functionalities, the configuration is growing and becoming more complicated. The growing demand and complexity also make these web applications a preferred target for intruders on the internet. Even with the support of security specialists, they remain highly problematic for the complexity of penetration and code reviewing methods. It requires considering different testing patterns in both codes reviewing and penetration testing. As a result, the number of hacked websites is increasing day by day. Most of these vulnerabilities also occur due to incorrect input validation and lack of result validation for lousy programming practices or coding errors. Vulnerability scanners for web applications can detect a few vulnerabilities in a dynamic approach. These are quite easy to use; however, these often miss out on some of the unique critical vulnerabilities in a different and static approach. Although these are time-consuming, they can find complex vulnerabilities and improve developer knowledge in coding and best practices. Many scanners choose both dynamic and static approaches, and the developers can select them based on their requirements and conditions. This research explores and provides details of SQL injection, operating system command injection, path traversal, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities through dynamic and static approaches. It also examines various security measures in web applications and selected five tools based on their features for scanning PHP, and JAVA code focuses on SQL injection, cross-site scripting, Path Traversal, operating system command. Moreover, this research discusses the approach of a cyber-security tester or a security developer finding out vulnerabilities through dynamic and static approaches using manual and automated web vulnerability scanners. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

As a result, each IT application has its authentication mechanism, and an employee needs a username and password. As the number of applications increased, as a result, it became increasingly complex to manage all identities like the number of usernames and passwords of an employee. All identities had to be retrieved by users. Both the identities and the access rights associated with those identities had to be protected by an administrator. Management couldn’t even capture such access rights because they couldn’t verify things like privacy and security. Identity management can help solve this problem. The concept behind identity management is to centralize identity management and manage access identity centrally rather than multiple applications with their authentication and authorization mechanisms. In this research work, we develop governance and an identity management framework for information and technology infrastructures with privileged access management, consisting of cybersecurity policies and strategies. The results show the efficiency of the framework compared to the existing information security components. The integrated identity and access management and privileged access management enable organizations to respond to incidents and facilitate compliance. It can automate use cases that manage privileged accounts in the real world. © 2021 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116626379

There is a relationship between how risk is perceived and how someone acts, with protection motivation theory (PMT) providing a particularly salient framework for explaining this connection. Exploration of how one perceives his or her own vulnerability to CS victimization is essential to understanding this interaction, and risk mitigation of threats relies heavily on the human despite increased reliance on digital technologies such as machine learning that can be used proactively and in real time yet are still impacted by human behavior. This study sought to examine the information security attitudes and behaviors that contribute to perceived CS vulnerability. A convenience sample of 612 college students sampled from two public universities in the United States completed a brief demographic survey and the Online Security Behavior and Beliefs Questionnaire. The instrument demonstrated good internal reliability with an index of perceived vulnerability significantly and positively correlating with multiple subscales. Linear regression indicated subscales that tended to focus more on one's inner belief that he or she is capable and competent enough to understand the nature of CS risks was predictive of perceived vulnerability, potentially resulting from a social desirability response bias which yielded an overly favorable self-report. PMT suggests that knowledge is an essential factor influencing decision making and results of this study suggest that perceived vulnerability may depend upon the appraisal of experience more so than one's actual knowledge or competence. © 2021 Copyright, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116064645

Given that aging users face additional challenges when using IT than their younger counterparts, the goal of this exploratory study is to investigate caregivers' strategies and barriers for helping to protect the privacy of aging IT users with ID. Six caregivers (four paid caregivers, two family members) of aging users with ID completed a series of six focus groups about their experiences assisting the people they support with using IT, including their strategies and barriers for helping to protect these users' privacy. Participants were also asked about their own attitudes and experiences related to online privacy and information security. Based on our inductive thematic analysis of the qualitative data, participants used three main strategies to help protect the privacy of aging users with ID: (1) restricting access to personal information, (2) limiting disclosure of personal details, and (3) providing just-in-time instruction and feedback. We also identified four key barriers to privacy protection: (1) limited awareness and knowledge about information security, (2) balancing privacy and autonomy, (3) maintaining professional boundaries, and (4) residential care services' policies. Inclusive and transdisciplinary research is needed to address the elevated privacy and security risks for aging IT users with ID, and provide caregivers with training on how to support this population to use IT safely.

Time pressures and competing demands mean that users tend to rely on habitual behaviors that often run counter to good cybersecurity practice. One possible solution may be to encourage positive habit formation. Designing such interventions, however, relies on knowledge of the perception and experience of habit formation in the context of cybersecurity. To this end, a qualitative survey containing open-ended questions was completed by 195 participants (mean age = 35.51, 53 percent female) recruited via an online participant panel. Participants were asked what cybersecurity behaviors they perform at work and how they believe any habits were prompted, formed, and maintained. Thematic analysis identified three over-arching themes: (a) forming habits unavoidably or unconsciously (some were mandated, or formed without conscious awareness), (b) consciously cultivating habits (including the roles of intrinsic motivation and external prompts), and (c) social and organizational influences (including the influence of occupational culture, social modeling, previous experiences, and information gathering practices). Based on these findings, we present guidelines for supporting workplace cybersecurity habit formation reflecting these subjective experiences, namely introducing automatic solutions, facilitating external cues, fostering interest in cybersecurity issues among employees, creating a positive cybersecurity occupational culture and highlighting positive behavior, and providing access to accessible cybersecurity information to employees. These results constitute a first step in identifying how habits can be exploited for positive cybersecurity behavior change in a way that accounts for the reliance on habitual behaviors in busy, time-pressured workplaces. © 2021 Copyright, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116005380

Furthermore, we will discuss how to incorporate this topic into the teaching of biomedical informatics. As of May 2021, the EU Regulation 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council (MDR - Medical Device Regulation) came into force, which largely expands the definition of a medical device and changes the way of notification of a medical device compared to the previous legislation. In addition, the MDR also redefines the rules for software as a medical device and defines the classification of different types of software into risk classes, with software moving to higher risk classes in most cases.At the same time, the use of software in the healthcare sector continues to expand. So far, this issue has not received much attention in the teaching of computer science or biomedical informatics. However, we consider very important that students become familiar with the legislative environment that affects the development and use of software in the specific environment of healthcare on an ongoing basis during their studies. In addition to the MDR, this includes the law on cyber security, the law on the digitization of healthcare and other related regulations. In addition, there are a number of technical standards that are closely related to the aforementioned laws. Therefore, students need to learn to understand these standards in order to be able to apply them in their future jobs.In 2019, the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering of CTU received accreditation for the Master's degree program in Biomedical and Clinical Informatics. Already in the curriculum design, we have envisaged the inclusion of the above-mentioned topics in the curriculum.

This paper discusses the considerations and complexities in developing innovative, effective, and validated SaMD for multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of SaMD requires a formalised approach (design control), inclusive of technical verification and analytical validation to ensure reliability. SaMD must be clinically evaluated, characterised for benefit and risk, and must conform to regulatory requirements associated with device classification. Cybersecurity and data privacy are also critical. Careful consideration of patient and provider needs throughout the design and testing process help developers overcome challenges of adoption in medical practice. Here, we explore the development pathway for SaMD in MS, leveraging experiences from the development of Floodlight™ MS, a continually evolving bundled solution of SaMD for remote functional assessment of MS. The development process will be charted while reflecting on common challenges in the digital space, with a view to providing insights for future developers. © 2021 by the authors.

Accurate prioritization allows the attention to be focused on the most critical vulnerabilities and their timely elimination; otherwise, organizations may face severe financial consequences or damage to their reputations. In addition, the large amounts of data generated by various components of security systems further impede the process of prioritizing the detected vulnerabilities. Therefore, the detection and elimination of critical vulnerabilities are challenging tasks. The solutions proposed for this problem in the scientific literature so far—e.g., PatchRank, SecureRank, Vulcon, CMS, VDNF, or VEST—are not sufficient because they do not consider the context of the organization. On the other hand, commercial solutions, such as Nessus, F-Secure, or Qualys, do not provide detailed information regarding the prioritization procedure, except for the scale. Therefore, in this paper, the authors present an open-source solution called the Vulnerability Management Center (VMC) in order to assist organizations with the vulnerability prioritization process. The VMC presents all calculated results in a standardized way by using a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which allows security analysts to fully understand environmental components’ influences on the criticality of detected vulnerabilities. In order to demonstrate the benefits of using the the open-source VMC software developed here, selected models of a vulnerability management process using CVSS are studied and compared by using three different, real testing environments. The open-source VMC suite developed here, which integrates information collected from an asset database, is shown to accelerate the process of removal for the critical vulnerabilities that are detected. The results show the practicability and efficacy of the selected models and the open-source VMC software, which can thus reduce organizations’ exposure to potential threats. © 2021 by the authors.

This situation, known as imbalanced data classification, causes low predictive performance for the minority class examples. Thus, the prediction model is unreliable although the overall model accuracy can be acceptable. Oversampling and undersampling techniques are well-known strategies to deal with this problem by balancing the number of examples of each class. However, their effectiveness depends on several factors mainly related to data intrinsic characteristics, such as imbalance ratio, dataset size and dimensionality, overlapping between classes or borderline examples. In this work, the impact of these factors is analyzed through a comprehensive comparative study involving 40 datasets from different application areas. The objective is to obtain models for automatic selection of the best resampling strategy for any dataset based on its characteristics. These models allow us to check several factors simultaneously considering a wide range of values since they are induced from very varied datasets that cover a broad spectrum of conditions. This differs from most studies that focus on the individual analysis of the characteristics or cover a small range of values. In addition, the study encompasses both basic and advanced resampling strategies that are evaluated by means of eight different performance metrics, including new measures specifically designed for imbalanced data classification. The general nature of the proposal allows the choice of the most appropriate method regardless of the domain, avoiding the search for special purpose techniques that could be valid for the target data. © 2021 by the authors.

Most schools and universities were forced to use e-learning tools. The fast transition to distance learning increased the digitalization of the educational system and influenced the increase of security incident numbers as there was no time to estimate the security level change by incorporating new e-learning systems. Notably, preparation for distance learning was accompanied by several limitations: lack of time, lack of resources to manage the information technologies and systems, lack of knowledge on information security management, and security level modeling. In this paper, we propose a security level estimation model for educational organizations. This model takes into account distance learning specifics and allows quantitative estimation of an organization’s security level. It is based on 49 criteria values, structured into an AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) tree, and arranged to final security level metric by incorporating experts’ opinion-based criteria importance coefficients. The research proposed a criteria tree and obtained experts’ opinions lead to educational organization security level evaluation model, resulting in one quantitative metric. It can be used to model different situations and find the better alternative in case of security level, without external security experts usage. Use case analysis results and their similarity to security experts’ evaluation are presented in this paper as validation of the proposed model. It confirms the model meets experts-based information security level ranking, therefore, can be used for simpler security modeling in educational organizations. © 2021 by the authors.

Using an online behavioural economics experiment with 4800 participants across four EU countries, this study tests a predictive model of cyberinsurance adoption, incorporating elements of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) as well as factors in relation to risk propensity and price. During the experiment, participants were given the opportunity to purchase different cybersecurity measures and cyberinsurance products before performing an online task. Participants likelihood of suffering a cyberattack was dependent upon their adoption of cybersecurity measures and their behaviour during the online task. The consequences of any attack were dependent upon the participants insurance decisions. Structural equation modelling was applied and the model was further developed to include elements of the wider security ecosystem. The final model shows that all TPB factors, and response efficacy from the PMT, positively predicted adoption of premium cyberinsurance. Interestingly, adoption of cybersecurity measures was associated with safer behaviour online, contrary to concerns of “moral hazard”. The findings highlight the need to consider the larger cybersecurity ecosystem when designing interventions to increase adoption of cyberinsurance and/or promote more secure online behaviour. © 2021 by the authors.

Recently, attention to privacy has grown thanks to the introduction of specific regulations such as the European GDPR. In some fields, including recommender systems, this has inevitably led to a decrease in the amount of usable data, and, occasionally, to significant degradation in performance mainly due to information no longer being attributable to specific individuals. In this article, we present a dynamic privacy-preserving approach for recommendations in an academic context. We aim to implement a personalised system capable of protecting personal data while at the same time allowing sensible and meaningful use of the available data. The proposed approach introduces several pseudonymisation procedures based on the design goals described by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity in their guidelines, in order to dynamically transform entities (e.g., persons) and attributes (e.g., authored papers and research interests) in such a way that any user processing the data are not able to identify individuals. We present a case study using data from researchers of the Georg Eckert Institute for International Textbook Research (Brunswick, Germany). Building a knowledge graph and exploiting a Neo4j database for data management, we first generate several pseudoN-graphs, being graphs with different rates of pseudonymised persons. Then, we evaluate our approach by leveraging the graph embedding algorithm node2vec to produce recommendations through node relatedness. The recommendations provided by the graphs in different privacy-preserving scenarios are compared with those provided by the fully non-pseudonymised graph, considered as the baseline of our evaluation. The experimental results show that, despite the structural modifications to the knowledge graph structure due to the de-identification processes, applying the approach proposed in this article allows for preserving significant performance values in terms of precision. © 2021 by the authors.

These are large datasets, so it is important to reduce them. The author’s motivation was to develop a method of assessing the dimensionality of features based on correlation measures and the discriminant power of features allowing for a more accurate reduction of their dimensions compared to the classical Kaiser criterion and assessment of scree plot. The method proved to be promising. The results obtained in the experiments demonstrate that the quality of classification after extraction is better than using classical criteria for estimating the number of components and features. Experiments were carried out for various extraction methods, demonstrating that the rotation of factors according to centroids of a class in this classification task gives the best risk assessment of chemical threats. The classification quality increased by about 7% compared to a model where feature extraction was not used and resulted in an improvement of 4% compared to the classical PCA method with the Kaiser criterion, with an evaluation of the scree plot. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is a certain subspace of cybersecurity features, which complemented with the features of the concentration of volatile substances, affects the risk assessment of chemical hazards. The identified cybersecurity factors are the number of packets lost, incorrect Logins, incorrect sensor responses, increased email spam, and excessive traffic in the computer network.

To regain access, victims would typically need to make a ransom payment. Victims get notified that their device has been infected through a ransom note (splash screen) displayed on their device. Ransomware splash screens can be presented in many ways; the most common ones are via a text file or a graphical user interface (GUI). Splash screens may also include additional features, such as a countdown timer, as part of the ransomware operator's ploy to encourage their victims to pay. The main aim of this study was to gain valuable insights into how ransomware splash screens might affect victims’ responses. Moreover, the study also investigated whether exposure to different splash screens would encourage participants to adopt good security behaviours. A controlled experiment was conducted by randomly assigning 538 participants into one of the three ransomware infection scenarios based on the splash screen type (Text-based, GUI or GUI + Timer). After watching a demonstration of a ransomware scenario, each participant was asked to complete a survey regarding their post-infection behaviour and their cybersecurity habits. The study concluded that ransomware's user interface elements do not have a notable effect on how victims would react, in terms of their willingness to pay or their reporting rates. Additionally, even though 60% of the participants would like to report a ransomware incident, they were not sure how to do this. This illustrates a lack of public awareness about cybercrime reporting. Lack of trust was the main reason why participants did not want to click on links offering cybersecurity advice after the exposure. This shows that more effective methods for encouraging cybersecurity behaviour are still needed. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111973237

We use internet of things (IoT) case studies (such as the Mirai Botnet affair) and the criminological concept of ‘routine activity theory’ to situate our critique. Our study shows that current cybersecurity standards mainly assume smart home environments are (and will continue to be) underpinned by cloud architectures. This is a shortcoming in the longevity of standards. This paper argues that edge computing approaches, such as personal information management systems, are emerging for the IoT and challenge the cloud focused assumptions of these standards. In edge computing, data can be stored in a decentralised manner, locally and analysed on the client using federated learning. This can have advantages for security, privacy and legal compliance, over centralised cloud-based approaches, particularly around cross border data flows and edge based security analytics. As a consequence, standards should start to reflect the increased interest in this trend to make them more aspirational and responsive for the long term; as ultimately, current IoT architectures are a choice, as opposed to inherent. Our paper unpacks the importance of the adoption of edge computing models which could enable better management of external cyber-criminality threats in smart homes. We also briefly discuss challenges of building smart homes that can accommodate the complex nature of everyday life in the home.

Only in 2020, over ten million DDoS attacks were observed worldwide. Commonly, open-loop network traffic rate policing is used to mitigate them. That is how network devices are currently designed. This paper shows how to extend the state-of-the-art design by introducing the adaptive closed-loop tuning of policing mechanisms. As demonstrated experimentally, open-loop policing based on the celebrated token-bucket mechanism generates a steady-state control error. In contrast, the robust self-tuning controller eliminates that control error while adjusting the bitrate limiting operations to the severe and hardware-specific network operating conditions during a DDoS attack. The study shows the controller's implementation details and discusses the critical difficulties encountered in its technical development. Furthermore, it illustrates how the control error variance depends on the commanded traffic rate limit and explains why the self-tuning controller's anti-windup filter may fail to bring the control signal back to the set of admissible control values.

Preemptive mitigation of the cyber risks that arise in this hyperconnected space is needed to ensure continued patient safety. Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyse the robustness of existing policy measures in securing the Internet of Medical Things technologies. The regulatory ecosystem in the US is primarily discussed herein and includes regulatory frameworks for industry, public-private partnerships, and transparency initiatives. Methods: A qualitative review of the medical cybersecurity literature was performed with collation of federal and international legal documents, policy reports, industry frameworks, cyberbreach analyses, and scientific journal articles. Results: Regulatory guidance documents introduced to date that address cybersecurity in the Internet of Medical Things place a key emphasis on device identification, legacy device management, enhanced physical security, and breach detection. Recent oversight trends aim to bolster federal authority around the enforcement of baseline security safeguards. Conclusions: Additional regulatory guidance is needed to mitigate risks in the Internet of Medical Things devices conferred by retrofitted IT infrastructures, edge-to-cloud interfaces, and off-the-shelf device components. Recent advancements in the cyber realm also raise the possibility of novel attack vectors, autonomous cyber-physical systems, and quantum computing threats. Interventions to promote awareness and security hygiene around the Internet of Medical Things devices can empower end users and facilitate smooth incident response. Lay summary: The rise “Smart” technologies such as voice assistants and adaptable at-home appliances moves us closer to a more personalized world that can enhance our daily lives. The field of medicine will be changed by these next generation “Internet of Things” technologies that possess the ability to interact with their users and their surrounding environment. These technologies are important because the precision with which medical devices interact with patients, healthcare workers, and other technology can have huge impact on patient care. For all of their promise, the increased interconnectivity that these devices possess also confers additional cybersecurity risks. Policy regulation and public health preparedness are critical for ensuring the benefits of these emerging technologies do not come at the expense of patient safety and privacy. In this Review, we discuss cybersecurity regulation in the Internet of Medical Things and highlight novel threats still in need of address at the policy and public-health levels. © 2021",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109452649

However, widely researched CA mechanisms that rely on user's behavioural characteristics cannot be extended to continuously authenticate Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Challenges are exacerbated with the increased adoption of device-to-device (d2d) communication in critical infrastructures. Existing d2d authentication protocols proposed in the literature are either prone to subversion or are computationally infeasible to be deployed on constrained IoT devices. In view of these challenges, we propose a novel, Lightweight Continuous Device-to-Device Authentication (LCDA) protocol that leverages communication channel properties and a tunable mathematical function to generate dynamically changing session keys for continuous device authentication. Our extensive informal and formal analysis confirms the efficacy of the proposed LCDA protocol in terms of its resilience to known attack vectors, thereby demonstrating its strong potential for deployment in critical and resource-constrained scenarios for secure d2d communication. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109096739

Smart vehicles show the perfect model for a cyber-physical system when electronic components and physical devices are embedded in them. The incorporation of computer, network and physical methods are the cyber-physical systems (CPS). Integrated Systems and Network control and manage physical processes, feedback mechanisms that influence physical computation processes and vice versa. Cyber-devices, including hardware, software applications, are protected from cyber-attacks through cybersecurity. Individuals and businesses use this strategy to shield themselves from unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized networks. As the IoT and data remain fundamentally related, virtual vehicle hijacking is possible in the transport network's evolving design. Hence in this paper, IoT-based Advanced Electronic Cyber-Physical System (AE-CPS) has been proposed to minimize the cyber-attack and enhance security for the smart vehicle. Cyber-assault involves cyber-criminals launching a single computer or several computers or networks with one or more computers. A cyber-attack can maliciously deactivate computers, stolen data, or use a broken computer for other attacks. A cyber-attack happens when a hacker attempt to obtain unauthorized access to a computer or network data. It happens when information without permission is accessed. Personal details, such as social security numbers, passwords, and financial account numbers, may be included. First, a state-space structure reflects the driverless, smart vehicle with the board viewing system. The IoT embedded sensors monitor the device states since the smart vehicles and control center has been far from everyone. The vehicle's sensing data is sent through an insecure communication channel to the control center, where attacks occur. The optimal status estimate algorithm is derived from the mean square error theory for the vehicle conditions' information and visualization. The optimization algorithm focused on the partial definite programming approach is designed to govern the vehicle states. The experimental results show that there are less delay and a high-performance rate of 98.97%. high security rate (95.23%), time stages (8.12%), state reaction rate (90.9%), error rate (6.45%), evaluation metrics (93.6%), reaction time (1.44%), feedback period (96.88%) when compared to other methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108161438

Upon intrusion, log files are usually forged in order to hide or fake evidence. If the system is completely compromised, malicious code can be executed in kernel or hypervisor mode making even signed log files vulnerable. As a countermeasure, some systems archive the log files on another system through the network. This solution is not always suitable or desirable and it just shifts the problem elsewhere. The log files need to be preserved on another networked machine which may itself be attacked. In this paper, we present a simple scheme to authenticate local log files based on a forward integrity model. The scheme is based on a realistic assumption: nowadays, storage is very cheap. We can authenticate the logged data generated, starting from boot time to the instant that the malicious code elevates privileges. This tamper-evident scheme does not depend on special security hardware or securing a distributed system. We also present a prototype implementation of this scheme, SealFS. Our implementation, which showcases this approach, is a novel stackable file system for Linux. It enables tamper-evident logging to all existing applications, provides backwards compatibility and instant deployability.

As with most data these days, the size and dimensionality of the data within these fields are constantly growing, which makes it essential to develop an approach that can both accurately and efficiently identify anomalies within these datasets. In this paper, we address the problem of one-class anomaly detection, where after training on a singular class, we try to determine whether or not inputs belong to that said class. Most of the currently existing methods have limitations in which the criterion of the novel class relies solely on the reconstruction error term. We attempt to break away from this restriction by proposing the use of an autoencoder network with a normalization term. We pair this with an additive novelty scoring module during the training procedure as a way to determine the difference between a given image and our determined normal class, therefore improving the efficiency of our model. We evaluate our model on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST, three popular datasets for image classification, and compare the results against other various state-of-the-art models to determine the efficacy of our efforts. Our model not only outperforms the existing methods, but it also gives us a narrower range of AUCs for the tested classes, suggesting a stark improvement in both accuracy and precision. Moreover, we discover that introducing this “Novelty Normalization” concept into our model allows us to expand its usage into multiclass scenarios without a steep drop in accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107693088

We also look at the interplay between sensitivity and specificity when putting together systems that use a simple majority adjudication scheme (e.g. 3-out-of-5).

In countries like Singapore, legislative efforts to quell fake news constitute relatively new and understudied contexts for understanding local information operations. This paper presents a social cybersecurity analysis of the 2020 Singaporean elections, which took place at the height of the pandemic and after the recent passage of an anti-fake news law. Harnessing a dataset of 240,000 tweets about the elections, we found that 26.99% of participating accounts were likely to be bots, responsible for a larger proportion of bot tweets than the election in 2015. Textual analysis further showed that the detected bots used simpler and more abusive second-person language, as well as hashtags related to COVID-19 and voter activity—pointing to aggressive tactics potentially fuelling online hostility and questioning the legitimacy of the polls. Finally, bots were associated with larger, less dense, and less echo chamber-like communities, suggesting efforts to participate in larger, mainstream conversations. However, despite their distinct narrative and network maneuvers, bots generally did not hold significant influence throughout the social network. Hence, although intersecting concerns of political conflict during a global pandemic may promptly raise the possibility of online interference, we quantify both the efforts and limits of bot-fueled disinformation in the 2020 Singaporean elections.

To mitigate these challenges, distribution network operators and regulators are looking towards the coordinated control of smart inverter-based DERs to support the utility grid and provide additional services. Smart inverters have advanced grid supportive functions that assist the utility in maintaining power quality and stability. However, it is not practical for network operators to directly monitor and control each individual inverter and DER. As a result, distribution energy resource management systems (DERMS) and virtual power plants (VPPs) are being tested out in international states with high leading renewable energy penetration, such as Hawaii, Arizona, California and Victoria. DERMS and VPPs can aggregate and optimize the performance of various DERs through smart inverters. This paper investigates the characteristics and benefits of the existing coordinated control techniques of smart inverters as applied in contexts of high DER penetration internationally. The value of smart inverter coordinated control is presented through a literature review and international examples. Based on the review of international practice, recommendations for South Africa are made considering the local context regarding existing infrastructure and grid regulation restrictions, which affect the necessary communications protocol for coordinated control through a DERMS or VPP. The paper finds that VPPs or DERMS in South Africa are feasible, but with the relevant cybersecurity measures and technical regulations update for smart inverter functionality. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116714279

Since an insider threats usually expand and spread internally, no one could predict what, when and how exactly malicious insider launched their attacks. This is in a view of fact that an email becomes one of the primary targets of an internal threats as this medium widely used by everyone to communicate, share, and exchange confidential information. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand the nature of insider threats behavior beforehand and construct an accurate detection model. Furthermore, every single keyword used in an email can reflect the behavior of an individual and can be used to determine their intentions i.e., have motive to launch an insider threat or not. Henceforth, an innovative approach is proposed in modelling an insider threats detection in this work. In addition, various statistical analysis i.e., scoring, Friedman, linear regression (R2) and correlation coefficient applied to analyze an insider threat relationship among historical insider threats behavior and relevant extracted keywords from an email content. The Friedman statistical used to determine the minimum differences between each extracted insider threats keywords that represent different insider threats factor (motive, opportunity, capability). Besides, linear regression applied to estimate the relationship of an insider threats from training keywords and testing keyword with allocate anomaly score. Finally, the correlation coefficient approach used to determine how strong a relationship is between extracted insider threats keywords and insider threats behavior in this research.

Rapid increase of network devices has created many new attacks and therefore presented significant difficulties for network security to identify threats correctly. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) guarantee the network's confidentiality, integrity, and availability by monitoring network traffic and blocking any potential intrusions. Despite significant research efforts, IDS still confronts many difficulties in increasing detection efficiency and decreasing false alarm rates. Intrusion detection systems are using machine learning and deep learning-based IDS to identify intrusions throughout the network as quickly as possible. This paper identifies the idea of IDS and the following details the taxonomy developed based on the prominent Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods used in NIDS system design. An in-depth analysis of NIDS-based papers is discussed to outline the benefits and weaknesses of the various options.

Hackers can commit crimes through a variety of Internet technologies. In recent years, phishing incidents have become more frequent, and the rapid development of information technology has enabled hackers to develop more advanced phishing attacks. Furthermore, the release of phishing toolkits, which are collections of software tools, make it easier for people with minimal technical skills to launch their own phishing attacks. Therefore, more attention must be paid to the prevention of such attacks. Protection from phishing websites has various aspects, including user training, public awareness, technical security measures and others. In this research, we further improve the phishing detection on phishing kits. This research proposes to use the combination HTML structural feature with the features proposed by AI@ntiPhish1.0 to train the phishing detection model.

The Horizon 2020 project GEIGER wants to address this problem by providing a cybersecurity monitoring solution that can be used by IT-laypersons. In addition to an easy-to-use software tool focusing on the monitoring of imminent cyber threats GEIGER develops an Education Ecosystem, which approaches this target groups at different levels: from regular employees, who cannot or don't want to extensively deal with cybersecurity, to designated persons (internal or external), who are made responsible for monitoring the functioning of GEIGER in a company. To take full account of this, the competence level of individuals and their development are part of the data structure of the GEIGER monitoring. Hence, it also includes automated recommendations to follow certain training sequences included in GEIGER or from other sources. To define the different levels of competence in cybersecurity, i.e. also their development, to propose adequate learning objectives and design pertinent learning materials, GEIGER has elaborated a curriculum. The structure of this curriculum follows the conditions and requirements given by the general situation of security threats and learning scenarios in MSEs. It has three main dimensions: ĝ€levels' that reflect the competence development within MSE-specific learning environments; ĝ€pillars' that reflect the GEIGER-specific topical differentiation in general cybersecurity as well as handling and communicating GEIGER functions; object ĝ€layers' that reflect specific cybersecurity threats as they appear for the IT-lay target groups in MSEs.

We analyse the current situation in the Czech Republic, finding that although the shortage of experts affects the private and public sectors both, the public sector is constrained by a massive financial undervaluation of cybersecurity experts and other legal and systematic deficiencies and obstacles and therefore has a much lower chance of attracting talents in this field. The inability of public institutions to find relevant workforce causes, among other things, problems with formulating public procurements, assessing offers and communicating their requirements to the supply-side of the labour market. One of the solutions to this crisis might be in the systematic support of education programmes. However, the cybersecurity field is so dynamic and fragmented that the alignment of the education programme with the market needs presents a significant challenge. There, a unified qualifications framework could serve as a basis for finding common ground. We focus on the benefits of creating such a framework, especially the benefits that a united taxonomy can bring to the cybersecurity labour market by bolstering cybersecurity higher education.

Therefore, in order to reason about an organisation's residual risk, it is critical to possess an accurate understanding of the controls organisations have in place and of the influence that these controls have on the likelihood that organisations will be harmed by a cyber-incident. Supporting evidence, however, for the effectiveness of controls is often lacking. With the aim of enriching internal threat data, in this article we explore a practical exercise in the form of a capture-the-flag (CTF) study. We experimented with a set of security controls and invited four professional penetration testers to solve the challenges.

ATT&CK ""Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge""is a popular taxonomy by MITRE, which describes threat actor behaviors. Techniques are the foundation of the ATT&CK model, they are the actions that adversaries perform to accomplish goals, which translate into the model's tactics. The aim of ATT&CK is to categorize adversary behavior to help improve the post-compromise detection of advanced intrusions. Software vulnerabilities (CVE) play an important role in cyber-intrusions, mostly classified into 4 ATT&CK techniques, which cover the exploitation phase of the attack chain. Identifying vulnerabilities that are actively exploited by the attackers, and understanding how a vulnerability can enable the attacker at each stage of the attack life cycle is absolutely critical for vulnerability assessments. Given the sparse classification of a CVE into ATT&CK taxonomy, lack of methods to extract labels from threat reports and, the volume of vulnerabilities disclosed defenders lack a concrete approach to prioritize CVE's based on their role in the attack chain and in the context of controls in place. In this work, we propose a Multi-Head Joint Embedding Neural Network model to automatically map CVE's to ATT&CK techniques. We address the problem of lack of labels for this task, by a novel unsupervised labeling technique. We enrich CVE's with a curated knowledgebase 50 mitigation strategies, which help the model to learn both attacker and defender view of a given CVE. We evaluate our approach with the dataset containing CVE's disclosed from the past 10 years and compare it with standard baseline models and ablation analysis.

The framework suggests five SME types based on their characteristics and specific security needs: cybersecurity abandoned SME, unskilled SME, expert-connected SME, capable SME, and cybersecurity provider SME. In addition to describing the five classes, the study explains the framework's usage in sampled SMEs. The framework proposes solutions for each class to approach cybersecurity awareness and competence more consistent with SME needs. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113235090

To build a reliable overview of cyber risk, there is a need to adopt continuous monitoring of emerged cyber threats related to that risk. Indeed, the integration of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) into cybersecurity solutions provides valuable information about threats, targets, and potential vulnerabilities. Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX), as a language for expressing information about cyber threats in a structured and unambiguous manner, is becoming a de facto standard for sharing information about cyber threats. In addition, ontology-based semantic knowledge modeling has become a promising solution that provides a machine-readable language for downstream work in cybersecurity problem-solving. In this paper, we propose an ontology using CTI for risk monitoring. This latter improves an existing ontology, originally proposed to be used within a SIEM (Security Information Event Management), by extending it and aligning it with the STIX concepts. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113233715

Specifically, attention has been given to sequential learning models, due to their ability to extract the temporal characteristics of network traffic flows (NetFlows), and use them for NIDS tasks. However, the applications of these sequential models often consist of transferring and adapting methodologies directly from other fields, without an in-depth investigation on how to leverage the specific circumstances of cybersecurity scenarios; moreover, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on sequential models that rely on NetFlow data, which presents significant advantages over traditional full packet captures. We tackle this problem in this paper. We propose a detailed methodology to extract temporal sequences of NetFlows that denote patterns of malicious activities. Then, we apply this methodology to compare the efficacy of sequential learning models against traditional static learning models. In particular, we perform a fair comparison of a ĝ€sequential' Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) against a ĝ€static' Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) in distinct environments represented by two well-known datasets for NIDS: the CICIDS2017 and the CTU13. Our results highlight that LSTM achieves comparable performance to FNN in the CICIDS2017 with over 99.5% F1-score; while obtaining superior performance in the CTU13, with 95.7% F1-score against 91.5%.

In order to automate this step and enable reuse of components or even entire scenarios, this paper proposes Nautilus, a Cyber Range with extended capabilities that at the same time provides a training environment and a ""marketplace""platform to share scenarios, pre-implemented vulnerabilities/CVEs, scripts, etc. Nautilus leverages advanced cloud technologies to semi-automate deployment of vulnerable configurations of virtualized networks and systems, provides a graphical interface and a scenario description language, and integrates easy-to-use data/knowledge sharing facilities. In this respect, we believe that Nautilus can foster collaboration among different training teams and programs, and stimulate less skilled trainers, which alone would have perhaps prepared only basic scenarios, to access and reuse more advanced exercises prepared by others.

This growing phenomenon emphasizes the central role of cybersecurity and, in particular, the reaction against ongoing threats targeting assets within the protected system. Such centrality is reflected in the literature, where several works have been presented to propose full-fledged reaction methodologies to tackle offensive incidents' consequences. In this direction, the work in [18] developed an immuno-based response approach based on the application of the Artificial Immune System (AIS) methodology. That is, the AIS-powered reaction is able to calculate the optimal set of atomic countermeasure to enforce on the asset within the monitored system, minimizing the risk to which those are exposed in a more than adequate time. To further contribute to this line, the paper at hand presents AISGA, a multi-objective approach that leverages the capabilities of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the selection of the input parameters of the AIS methodology. Specifically, AISGA selects the optimal ranges of inputs that balance the tradeoff between minimizing the global risk and the execution time of the methodology. Additionally, by flooding the AIS-powered reaction with a wide range of possible inputs, AISGA intends to demonstrate the robustness of such a model. Exhaustive experiments are executed to precisely compute the optimal ranges of parameters, demonstrating that the proposed multi-objective optimization prefers a fast-but-effective reaction. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113229832

To avoid discriminating newer research, such a metric is usually measured in average yearly citations. Understanding and characterizing how citations behave have been prime research topics, yet investigations targeting the cybersecurity domain seem to be particularly scarce. In this perspective, the paper aims at filling this gap by analyzing average yearly citations for 6,693 papers published in top-tier conferences and journals in cybersecurity. Results indicate the existence of three clusters, i.e., general security conferences, general security journals, and cryptography-centered publications. The analysis also suggests that the amount of conference-to-conference citations stands out compared to journal-to-journal and conference-to-journal citations. Besides, papers published at top conferences attract more citations although a direct comparison against other venues is not straightforward. To better quantify the impact of works dealing with cybersecurity aspects, the paper introduces two new metrics, namely the number of main words in the title, and the combined number of unique main words in title, abstract and keywords. Collected results show that they can be associated with average yearly citations (together with the number of cited references).

""Adversarial thinking""(at) is viewed as a central idea in cybersecurity. We believe a similar idea carries over into other critical areas as well, such as understanding the perils of social networks and machine learning. Objectives. What kinds of at can we expect of early post-secondary computing students? In particular, can they meaningfully analyze computing systems that are well beyond their technical ken? Is their analysis limited to only a social or only a technical space? Method. In an introductory post-secondary course, we study student responses to questions designed to exercise at, broadly defined. To do this we develop a rubric that provides insight into desirable content. Results. We find that these students are fairly strong at at. They are regularly able to adopt an adversarial or empathetic viewpoint and analyze quite sophisticated systems. Most of all, they can meaningfully do so (a) outside an explicit cybersecurity context, (b) even from an introductory level, and (c) well before they understand well the key technologies under evaluation. On the other hand, we also find several instances where students do not explore systems as much as they could, and fail to reference other material they know, which could be evidence of lack of transfer. In addition, our rubric would benefit from refinement that would enable a more sophisticated analysis of student responses. Discussion. Our work provides a baseline evaluation of what we can expect from students. It suggests that at can be introduced early in the curriculum, and in contexts outside computer security. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113618491

We present a novel, end-to-end, automated framework for modeling new attack techniques from the textual description of security vulnerabilities. Given a description of a security vulnerability, the proposed framework first extracts the relevant attack entities required to model the attack, completes missing information on the vulnerability, and derives a new interaction rule that models the attack; this new rule is then integrated within the MulVal attack graph tool.

Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user's behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data-Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer-are employed.

Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable.

This communication backbone in turn also exposes MGs to potential malicious cyber attacks. To study these vulnerabilities and impacts of various cyber attacks, testbeds play a crucial role in managing their complexity. This research work presents a detailed study of the development of a real-time co-simulation testbed for inverter-based MGs. It consists of a OP5700 real-time simulator, which is used to emulate both the physical and cyber layer of an AC MG in real time through HYPERSIM software; and SEL-3530 Real-Time Automation Controller (RTAC) hardware configured with ACSELERATOR RTAC SEL-5033 software. A human–machine interface (HMI) is used for local/remote monitoring and control. The creation and management of HMI is carried out in ACSELERATOR Diagram Builder SEL-5035 software. Furthermore, communication protocols such as Modbus, sampled measured values (SMVs), generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) and distributed network protocol 3 (DNP3) on an Ethernet-based interface were established, which map the interaction among the corresponding nodes of cyber-physical layers and also synchronizes data transmission between the systems. The testbed not only provides a real-time co-simulation environment for the validation of the control and protection algorithms but also extends to the verification of various detection and mitigation algorithms. Moreover, an attack scenario is also presented to demonstrate the ability of the testbed. Finally, challenges and future research directions are recognized and discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

The sheer volume of news produced daily necessitates the development of automated methods for separating fact from fiction. To tackle this issue, the computer science community has produced a plethora of approaches, documented in a number of surveys. However, these surveys primarily rely on one-dimensional solutions, i.e., deception detection approaches that focus on a specific aspect of misinformation, such as a particular topic, language, or source. Misinformation is considered a major obstacle for situational awareness, including cyber, both from a company and a societal point of view. This paper explores the evolving field of misinformation detection and analytics on information published in news articles, with an emphasis on methodologies that handle multiple dimensions of the fake news detection conundrum. We analyze and compare existing research on cross-dimensional methodologies. Our evaluation process is based on a set of criteria, including a predefined set of performance metrics, data pre-processing features, and domains of implementation. Furthermore, we assess the adaptability of each methodology in detecting misinformation in real-world news and thoroughly analyze our findings. Specifically, survey insights demonstrate that when a detection approach focuses on several dimensions (e.g., languages and topics, languages and sources, etc.), its performance improves, and it becomes more flexible in detecting false information across different contexts. Finally, we propose a set of research directions that could aid in furthering the development of more advanced and accurate models in this field. © 2021 by the authors.

These attacks can cause many people or companies high financial losses or loss of private data. One of the most common types of attack on the Internet is a DoS (denial-of-service) attack, which, despite its simplicity, can cause catastrophic consequences. A slow DoS attack attempts to make the Internet service unavailable to users. Due to the small data flows, these attacks are very similar to legitimate users with a slow Internet connection. Accurate detection of these attacks is one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity. In this paper, we implemented our proposal of eleven major and most dangerous slow DoS attacks and introduced an advanced attack generator for testing vulnerabilities of protocols, servers, and services. The main motivation for this research was the absence of a similarly comprehensive generator for testing slow DoS vulnerabilities in network systems. We built an experimental environment for testing our generator, and then we performed a security analysis of the five most used web servers. Based on the discovered vulnerabilities, we also discuss preventive and detection techniques to mitigate the attacks. In future research, our generator can be used for testing slow DoS security vulnerabilities and increasing the level of cyber security of various network systems. © 2021 by the authors.

While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit in the academic literature that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats. © 2021 by the authors.

Utilizing such services has created numerous opportunities for enterprises infrastructure to become cloud-based and, in turn, assisted the enterprises to easily and flexibly offer services to their customers. The practice of renting out access to servers to clients for computing and storage purposes is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The popularity of IaaS has led to serious and critical concerns with respect to the cyber security and privacy. In particular, malware is often leveraged by malicious entities against cloud services to compromise sensitive data or to obstruct their functionality. In response to this growing menace, malware detection for cloud environments has become a widely researched topic with numerous methods being proposed and deployed. In this paper, we present online malware detection based on process level performance metrics, and analyze the effectiveness of different baseline machine learning models including, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosted Classifier (GBC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Our models were trained, validated, and tested by using a dataset of 40,680 malicious and benign samples. The dataset was complied by running different families of malware (collected from VirusTotal) in a live cloud environment and collecting the process level features. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117609348

LDoS attacks can easily evade conventional counter-DoS detection mechanisms because their time-averaged flow is small. Thus, LDoS attack is getting a serious problem nowadays. With the recent spread of IoT devices, Zigbee, one of the IoT communication standards, attracts much attention. Zigbee is a low-power wireless communication protocol at the sacrifice of its transfer range and bandwidth. Since Zigbee consumes low power, it is widely adopted for inexpensive small sensors and IoT that run on batteries. The advantage of the low power consumption of Zigbee is due to its use of indirect transmission. However, we newly found that vulnerability to LDoS attacks existed in the indirect transmission. In this study, we first point out this vulnerability and describe new LDoS attack scenarios exploiting it. Next, we propose simple countermeasures against them which require low computational cost. Then, simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of the attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasures. The experimental results show that the new LDoS attacks can decrease the normal packet arrival rate to 0% by adjusting the timing of attacks. It is also revealed that our proposed countermeasures successfully prevent such cases and improve the minimum arrival rate to 80% at best. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117589029

Traditional NER models are difficult to determine entities that have a complex structure in the field of cybersecurity, and it is difficult to capture non-local and non-sequential dependencies. In this paper, we propose a cybersecurity entity recognition model CyberEyes that uses non-local dependencies extracted by graph convolutional neural networks. The model can capture both local context and graph-level non-local dependencies.

As state-sponsored APT groups have been especially active in the past decade, recent studies have attempted to establish attribution with the limited set of information of the APT groups. Various government agencies and SOC vendors have utilized Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and Tactic, Technique, Procedures (TTPs) to collect intelligence pertaining to the adversaries, to no avail. Recently, MITRE's ATT&CK® framework has been widely adopted for collecting and documenting the TTPs of the various CTAs. This paper presents an Automated Reclassification for Threat Actors (ART) that quantitatively compares the TTPs from different APT groups. ART crawls cyber threat reports and retrieves the ATT&CK matrix of APT groups. Then, it vectorizes the ATT&CK matrix and calculates the cosine similarity. By reexamining the various aliases of the CTAs with the ATT&CK framework, we believe that ART can help classify the indiscriminately established APT groups. © 2021 TSI Enterprises.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117170386

Accordingly, the importance of technique for securing data stored in cloud storage is increasing. In particular, as the importance of data increases, an attack on cloud storage services is considered not as a simple threat to the safety of individual services, but as an attack from the perspective of cybersecurity that can threaten the well-being of society where the stored data is utilized. In this paper, we propose a technique for providing cloud service safety. Specifically, we consider three major requirements for providing information security of data stored in the cloud storage: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In the case of the previously proposed technique, only some of the three major requirements are intensively analyzed and countermeasures are proposed. Since there is a corresponding technique for individual requirements, it is possible to respond to each security requirement by parallelly applying the existing technologies. However, in the case of a system designed with such simple approaches, it is difficult to provide all security requirements by actually grafting it due to the difference in the configuration method of each hypothesis, or even if possible, efficiency impairment occurs. In this paper, we designed a technique that can efficiently meet the three major requirements from this point of view. © 2021 TSI Enterprises.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117167058

Nation-state adversaries have shown the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure through cyber-attacks targeting systems of networked, embedded computers. Moving target defenses (MTDs) have been proposed as a means for defending various networks and systems against potential cyber-attacks. MTDs differ from many cyber resilience technologies in that they do not necessarily require detection of an attack to mitigate the threat. We devised a MTD algorithm and tested its application to a real-time network. We demonstrated MTD usage with a real-time protocol given constraints not typically found in best-effort networks. Second, we quantified the cyber resilience benefit of MTD given an exfiltration attack by an adversary. For our experiment, we employed MTD which resulted in a reduction of adversarial knowledge by 97%. Even when the adversary can detect when the address changes, there is still a reduction in adversarial knowledge when compared to static addressing schemes. Furthermore, we analyzed the core performance of the algorithm and characterized its unpredictability using nine different statistical metrics. The characterization highlighted the algorithm has good unpredictability characteristics with some opportunity for improvement to produce more randomness. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116781307

We sought to answer the following questions: (1) Are certain professional demographics more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats? (2) Do professionals in different institution types (i.e., hospitals vs. primary care clinics) exhibit different cybersecurity behaviors? (3) Can Internet usage behaviors by professionals be indicative of their cybersecurity awareness and the risk they introduce? Methods A cross-sectional, anonymous, paper-based survey was distributed among professionals working in public health care organizations in Kuwait. Data were collected about each professional's role, experience, work environment, cybersecurity practices, and understanding to calculate a cybersecurity score which indicates their level of compliance to good cybersecurity practices. We also asked about respondents' internet usage and used K-means cluster analysis to segment respondents into three groups based on their internet activities at work. Ordinary least squares regression assessed the association between the collected independent variables in question on the overall cybersecurity behavior. Results A total of 453/700 (64%) were responded to the survey. The results indicated that professionals with more work experience demonstrated higher compliance with good cybersecurity practices. Interestingly, nurses demonstrate higher cybersecurity aptitude relative to physicians. Professionals that were less inclined to use the internet for personal use during their work demonstrated higher cybersecurity aptitude. Conclusion Our findings provide some guidance regarding how to target health care professional training to mitigate cybersecurity risks. There is a need for ensuring that physicians receive adequate cybersecurity training, despite the opportunity costs and other issues competing for their attention. Additionally, classifying professionals based on their internet browsing patterns may identify individuals vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents better than more discrete indicators such as age or gender. © 2021.

Visual analysis of the respective event streams complements the evaluation. Although the characteristic functions method is an order of magnitude faster, the accuracy of the results obtained is at least comparable to those obtained with the artificial neural network.

In their desire to control the 2019 coronavirus disease, large organizations have turned over the execution of their activities to the use of information technology. These tools, adapted to the use of the Internet, have been presented as an effective solution to the measures implemented by the majority of nations where quarantines are generalized. However, the solution given by information technologies has several disadvantages that must be solved. The most important in this regard is with the serious security incidents that exist, where many organizations have been compromised and their data has been exposed. As a solution, this work proposes the design of a guide that allows for the implementation of a computer incident response team on a university campus. Universities are optimal environments for the generation of new technologies; they also serve as the ideal test bed for the generation of security policies and new treatments for incidents in an organization. In addition, with the implementation of the computer incident response team in a university, it is proposed to be part of a response group to any security incident at the national level. © 2021 by the authors.

However, how to ensure the safety and legitimacy of these network user behaviors has become the focus of attention. As we all know, cybersecurity and system resilience originate from symmetry. Due to the diversity and unpredictability of cyber-attacks, absolute cybersecurity is difficult to achieve; system resilience indicates that protecting system security should shift from resisting attacks to ensuring system continuity. The trust evaluation of network users is a research hotspot in improving network system security. Aiming at the defects of incomplete evaluation processes and inaccurate evaluation results in current online user behavior trust evaluation methods, this paper combines the basic principles of online user trust evaluation and proposes a trust evaluation model that combines fuzzy Petri nets with user behavior analysis. First, for “unfamiliar” users, we used fuzzy Petri nets to calculate the user’s recommended trust value as the system’s indirect trust value; next, we used the user’s behavior record as evidence to conduct direct trust evaluation on the user to obtain the system’s direct trust in the user’s value; finally, the two calculation results were combined to obtain the user’s comprehensive trust value. In terms of experimental verification, the experimental data came from a self-developed e-book management system. Through theoretical analysis and simulation results, it was shown that the model met the optimization conditions of subjective and objective relative balance, the evaluation process was more complete, and the trust evaluation values of network users could be obtained more accurately. This evaluation method provides solid theory and research ideas for user credibility judgment of key network basic application platforms such as online shopping malls, online transactions, and online banking. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we present a solution for updating DL-IDS employing a transfer learning technique that allows us to retrain and fine-tune pre-trained models on small datasets with new attack behaviors. In our experiments, we built CNN-based IDS on the Bot-IoT dataset, and updated it on small data from a new dataset named TON-IoT. We obtained promising results in multiple metrics regarding the detection rate and the training between the initial training for the original model and the updated one, in the matter of detecting new attacks behaviors and improving the detection rate for some classes by overcoming the lack of their labeled data. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

From the systematic review, regarding the attacks, the results show that most attacks are carried out on the network layer, where Denial of Service (DoS)-related and Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks are the most prevalent ones. Regarding vulnerabilities, security flaws in services and source code, and incorrect validations in authentication procedures are highlighted. These are vulnerabilities that can be exploited by DoS attacks and buffer overflows in industrial devices and networks. Regarding defense strategies, Blockchain is presented as one of the most relevant technologies under study in terms of defense mechanisms, thanks to its ability to be used in a variety of solutions, from Intrusion Detection Systems to the prevention of Distributed DoS attacks, and most defense strategies are presented as an after-attack solution or prevention, in the sense that the defense mechanisms are only placed or thought, only after the harm has been done, and not as a mitigation strategy to prevent the cyberattack. Concerning challenges and trends, the review shows that digital sovereignty, cyber sovereignty, and data sovereignty are recent topics being explored by researchers within the Industry 4.0 scope, and GAIA-X and International Data Spaces are recent initiatives regarding data sovereignty.

These technologies collect, exchange and process data in order to dynamically adapt to a specific context. IoT is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems and, in this respect, has relevant security implications. A need for IoT security guidelines was identified by the industry in the early 2010s. While numerous institutions across the globe have proposed recommendations with a goal to help developers, distributors and users to ensure a secure IoT infrastructure, a strict set of regulations for IoT security is yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of security guidelines for IoT proposed by various organizations, and evaluate some of the existing technologies applied to ensure IoT security against these guidelines. We gathered recommendations proposed by selected government organizations, international associations and advisory groups, and compiled them into a set of the most common and important considerations, divided into eight categories. Then we chose a number of representative examples from IoT security technologies and evaluated them against these criteria. While none of the examined solutions fulfill all recommendations on their own, the existing technologies introduced by those solutions could be combined to create a design framework which satisfies all the requirements of a secure IoT device. Further research on this matter could be beneficial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to evaluate different security technologies for IoT device security against the compilation of criteria based on existing guidelines. © 2021 by the authors.

Common issues in integrating power grid with technology include security threat that reduces the expected assimilation performance. In the present work, a cybersecurity-assisted authentication method for smart grids is introduced to overcome false data flow. This method pre-estimates the energy requirement of the meters, depending on previously acquired information. Authentication-dependent security is provided according to the pre-estimated energy requirement and distribution manner. Variations in smart grid data for energy allocation are monitored based on network and end-user consumption until the users' current connection time. This method provides individual authentication for power-sharing and user verification, thereby improving false data's detection rate.

Governments have established anti-spam legislation, but surprisingly, there has been no measurement of policy impact. This study aims to fill the gap by utilizing a quasi-experimental setting in South Korea, where the anti-spam policy was substantially amended in November 2014. A significant change was in the default setting, switching from an opt-out to an opt-in scheme, which required that commercial email senders obtain recipients' prior consent. Also, the law notably escalated the deterrent penalties for perpetrators. To empirically examine the policy effectiveness, we use a large-scale data set of 5.61 billion spam emails originating from over 38,000 spammers in 226 countries during twenty months in 2014–2015. Our findings suggest that the amended policy adopting the opt-in scheme decreased the volume of spam originating from Korea by 16.1%. The expected economic gain from the increased productivity of recipients is 7.649 million USD per year. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting that a well-designed policy can lower cybersecurity incidents that threaten organizations, operations, and individuals.

The Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire was developed and administered to assess intuitive and rational judgments of cybersecurity risks. Two major findings of the study include: (1) three significant risk factors associated with both intuitive and rational cybersecurity judgment were Age Group, Region, and Prior GenCyber Camp Experience. That is, younger students, the campers from the West region, and participants attending the camps before tended to have a lower level of cybersecurity judgment; and (2) two significant protective factors were Cyber Use Length and Current GenCyber Camp Experience, i.e., the experiences of both using computers, Internet, cellphones and participating in the current camps having significant advantages in judging cybersecurity risks intuitively and rationally. Thus, it is critical to use both the push strategy to minimize the risk factors and the pull strategy to maximize the protective factors.

Recently, Estonia proposed a novel e-service delivery through the use of virtual assistants. Cybersecurity is important to any organization due to the prevalence of attacks in recent times. Organizations in both the public sector and private sector typically have a program that determines, calculates and treats risks. These programs are identified as 'risk management,' and cybersecurity risk assessment and analysis are a key part of these organizations. When correctly implemented, these programs can help decision makers allocate their cyber defense budgets in a more effective manner.The researchers conducted interviews with seven cybersecurity experts discussing cybersecurity data, metrics and risk assessment and analysis methods. These interviews informed the use of the Open Group's Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) model in this paper.Because Estonia is one of the first countries in the world to prioritize e-service development in this domain, there is a literature gap pertaining to cybersecurity risk analyses of virtual assistant enabled e-services. Although a multiplicity of methods exist for risk assessment and analysis, this research follows the FAIR method to assess a G2C e-service which uses a third party provider for an Amazon Alexa skill that has become corrupted due to malware infection. The FAIR method projects the risk for a particular vulnerability in terms of dollar amount loss over time. It states the annualized loss exposure in terms of a minimum loss, a maximum loss, and a most likely amount of loss.Aggregated global public sector cyber breach frequency data was taken from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse database and loss magnitude data was taken from the Cyentia IRIS 2020 report which utilized the Advisen cyber loss database. Based upon a Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distribution Monte Carlo simulation of this data, the annualized loss exposure projection for the public sector entity was $0 minimum likely value, most likely value $70,500 and maximum likely value of $6,000,000. Future work proposes more country and organization specific data for FAIR methodology use for G2C virtual assistant e-services analysis. The value of the work is that it shows how public sector agencies could use the FAIR model to make their cybersecurity risk models more quantitative than is generally currently practiced even in cases of new types of developments and services in order to aid decision-makers in allocation of funding to better defend against the most impactful risks. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117251077

Firstly, based on communication behavior features, a data-driven anomaly detection method is proposed to realize the preliminary screening of abnormal flow. At the same time, the corresponding physical features of abnormal flow are extracted.

This paper presents a deep learning approach to optically detect hidden hardware trojans in the manufacturing and assembly phase of printed circuit boards to secure electronic supply chains. Trojans can serve as backdoors of accessing on chip data, can potentially alter functioning and in some cases may even deny intended service of the chip. Apart from consumer electronics, printed circuit boards are used in mission critical applications like military and space equipment. Security compromise or data theft can have severe impact and thus demand research attention. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can be implemented in a manufacturing environment with limited training data. It can also provide better coverage in detection of hardware trojans over traditional methods. Image recognition algorithms need to have deeper penetration inside the training layers for recognizing physical variations of image patches. However, traditional network architectures often face vanishing gradient problem when the network layers are added. This hampers the overall accuracy of the network. To solve this a Residual network with multiple layers is used in this article. The ResNet34 algorithm can identify manufacturing tolerances and can differentiate between a manufacturing defect and a hardware trojan. The ResNet operates on the fundamental principle of learning from the residual of the output of preceding layer. In the degradation issue, it is observed that, a shallower network performs better than deeper network. However, this is with the downside of lower accuracy. Thus, a skip connection is made to provide an alternative path for the gradient to skip forward the training of few layers and add in multiple repeating blocks to achieve higher accuracy and lower training times. Implementation of this method can bolster automated optical inspection setup used to detect manufacturing variances on a printed circuit board. The results show a 98.5% accuracy in optically detecting trojans by this method and can help cut down redundancy of physically testing each board. The research results also provide a new consideration of hardware trojan benchmarking and its effect on optical detection. © Copyright © 2021 Kulkarni and Xu.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112284416

It describes how theoretical models and frameworks rely on either specific scenarios or controlled conditions and how decisions on cybersecurity spending within organizations-specifically, the funding available in comparison to the recommended security measures necessary for compliance-vary depending on stakeholders. As the tradeoff between the costs of implementing a security measure and the benefit derived from the implementation of security controls is not easily measured, a business leader's decision to fund security measures may be biased.

Our approach relies on two successive measurements of the scattering matrix at the injection ports, before and after the change.

Instead of using information from only a single configuration to detect FDI attacks, our proposed approach uses dynamic reconfiguration to compare measured and estimated states under multiple configurations to accurately detect FDI attacks.

Unfortunately, machine learning is not the holy grail of cybersecurity: machine learning-based techniques are hard to develop due to the lack of annotated data, are often computationally intensive, they can be target of hard to detect adversarial attacks, and more importantly are often not able to provide explanations for the predicted outcomes.

Specifically, we implemented a deep learning model which utilizes a substantially smaller amount of target domain data for host-based intrusion detection.In our experiments, we used two datasets from Australian Defense Force Academy; ADFA-WD as the source domain and ADFA-WD:SAA as the target domain datasets.

With a user interface enabling the management of multiple self sovereign identities, privacy consents, digital authorizations, and associated data driven transactions, the additional advantage of Disposable Identities is that they may also contain verifiable data such as the owner's photograph, official or even biometric identifiers for more proactive prevention of identity abuse.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used in different fields, but it is still relatively new in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security. In this paper, we provide an approach based on Machine Learning (ML) to intelligent threat recognition to enable run-time risk assessment for superior situation awareness in CPS security monitoring. With the aim of classifying malicious activity, several machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbours (kNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF), have been applied and compared using two different publicly available real-world testbeds. The results show that RF allowed for the best classification performance. When used in reference industrial applications, the approach allows security control room operators to get notified of threats only when classification confidence will be above a threshold, hence reducing the stress of security managers and effectively supporting their decisions. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115699904

The advancement of connected vehicles, which generate dynamic data through wireless communications, enables ITS to improve their efficiency, especially in Traffic Signal Control (TSC), which is the backbone of traffic flow scheduling. However, wireless communications channels are vulnerable to various types of cyberattacks and can pose serious threats to dynamic TSC systems. Attackers may attempt to manipulate normal traffic flows and cause severe traffic congestion. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful technique that has been used to improve TSC systems performance in real-time environments. However, it can be used by attackers to exploit the dynamics of the ITS and learn the optimal attack policy under the lack of deterministic information about system behavior. In this work, to highlight and exploit existing vulnerabilities in TSC systems, we leverage DRL to create an intelligent Sybil attack on a traffic intersection, wherein connected vehicles with fake identities are optimally placed to alter traffic signal timings by corrupting traffic data. The results show that this attack leads to substantial increase in the vehicles' travel time and yields disastrous traffic congestion, especially if carried out for a prolonged period of time, which will give rise to serious problems such as higher fuel consumption and air pollution in heavily dense cities. In the presence of such intelligent attacks, the design assumptions of existing TSC systems become highly questionable. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115699409

Protecting data, hardware, software alone is not sufficient as the technology is growing exponentially and information is easily available. Regarding artificial intelligence data, Sentinel One platform, endpoint security shows that from February 20, 2020, to March 17, 2020, the trend was in an upward motion, as the attacks attempted has peaked to 145 threats per 1,000 endpoints, in comparison to 31 or 38 at the start of that period.

Regardless of the complexities of the modern cyber climate, stereotypic defense solutions do not fulfill the information security requirements. Earlier detection techniques were sufficient to protect the cyber environment, but due to growing cyber threats such as Ransomware, malware, DDoS, we need strong protection techniques to restrict the threat's entry. Given this context, this study explains the evolution of the Preventive techniques and detective techniques; both the approaches are complementary, which would be discussed in this paper by considering Automation Technology.

While communication channels can be secured using strong ciphers, attackers who gain access to the channel can still perform certain types of attacks. One way to mitigate such attacks is to verify the integrity of exchanging messages between two parties or more. While there are robust integrity check mechanisms currently, these lack variety and very few are based on machine learning. This paper presents a methodology for performing an integrity check inspired by recent advances in neural cryptography. We provide formal, mathematical functions and an optimization problem for training an adversarial neural cryptography architecture. The proposed neural architectures can adequately solve the problem.

Security defenders propose many AI-based approaches to detect the massive number of malware variants. However, most AI-based malware detection approaches only output a label to users, and these labels are mainly unexplainable. The lack of transparency has introduced many black-box attacks. Malware developers can develop adversarial examples to evade these AI-based malware detection systems. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for malware detection and explanation, which can locate malicious code snippets by explaining the malware classifier decision result. To this end, firstly, we get the system call number sequence of the target sample with instrumentation tools in an elaborated sandbox. Secondly, we feed the mapped system call number sequence into a deep learning model to make a decision on whether the target sample is benign or malicious. Thirdly, we adopt the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation algorithm to find which slice of a sequence makes the greatest contribution in the decision.

Adversaries can use fake CTI examples as training input to subvert cyber defense systems, forcing their models to learn incorrect inputs to serve the attackers' malicious needs. In this paper, we show how to automatically generate fake CTI text descriptions using transformers.

Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115829730

Attackers are aware of this attitude and work to exploit it the way they can, by breaking up the security chain. The dramatic increase of Internet usage by people of different ages and backgrounds places them under serious cyberthreats and attacks. The most popular and straightforward motives of these attacks is basically the lack of awareness and knowledge around cybersecurity measures and procedures which dramatically increases security breaches.This research is motivated by the facts mentioned above, and it aims to assess the level of Internet users' security awareness among Palestinian learners. The study focuses on five fundamental security issues involving passwords, social media usage, email usage, security of mobile devices, and social engineering. A quantitative approach is employed in the study, where data was collected by means of pre-designed and tested questionnaires from a random sample of 200 participants. Data were collected, encoded, preprocessed and then analyzed using SPSS. Results emphasized the overall carelessness of Internet users in relation to security measures, knowledge and practices. Most of respondents did not try to gain any knowledge whatsoever by, for instance, attending an awareness course.

We derive a sequential generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for zero-mean Gaussian FDI attacks. Exploiting the fact that covariance matrices are positive, we propose strategies to detect positive semi-definite matrix additions rather than arbitrary changes in the covariance matrix. The distribution of the GLRT is only known asymptotically whereas quickest detectors deal with short sequences, thereby leading to loss of performance. Therefore, we use a finite-sample correction to reduce the false alarm rate. Further, we provide a numerical approach to estimate the threshold sequences, which are analytically intractable to compute. We also compare the average detection delay of the proposed detector for constant and varying threshold sequences. Simulations showed that the proposed detector outperforms the standard sequential GLRT detector. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113544910

Meanwhile, attack graphs have long been studied by researchers as a means of analysing the cybersecurity of both information and control systems. In this paper, we present a case study on the use of attack graphs for predicting the cybersecurity of a CPS within the critical national infrastructure. It explains how the attack graph was developed and analysed using existing system documentation, computer-aided techniques and human analysis. In this case study human cyber analysts with good knowledge of the CPS considered the automated predictions of the most exploitable attack paths to be credible. This enabled a detailed and evidenced analysis of the minimum level of cyber-attacker sophistication needed to compromise the CPS.

The hash value, frame name, and timestamp of the capturing time are stored in a CSV file. The genesis block of a permissioned blockchain is created with this data. Other frames are captured for the same scene every predefined period and hashed. If the new hash value is identical to the reference hash, then the new frame is deleted to preserve storage space, and the metadata of the frame is stored in the same CSV file. If the hash values are not identical, then the name of the frame is changed to the timestamp of the capturing time, the frame then is propagated to all participant nodes, an email is sent to a predefined mail to take the appropriate action, and finally, a new block will be created with the new metadata. The proposed system ensures the integrity of the captured videos, ease to use and robustness. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114198782

Lack of strategic investment decision by SMEs could lead to further risks and vulnerabilities. The significant increase of cybersecurity threats might become a very difficult task for both SMEs and other parties in the future. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential barriers to cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs based on conducting several interviews with decision-makers in the sector to understand the causes of this prevention. The authors aim to reveal the role the SMEs' decision-makers are playing in addressing cybersecurity risks in recent years and to suggest avenues for further research. The paper follows a qualitative exploratory approach to identify those potential barriers. Starting with an invitation are distributed by e-mail, phone call, or social medial account, to hundreds of Saudi's decision-makers in the SMEs sector, asking them to participate in this study. As a result, 20 participants from various SMEs business sectors have agreed to participate. Therefore, six potential barriers that play a key role in the prevention of cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs, which are the financial capacity, the lack of awareness, the size of SMEs, the traditional commerce, the absence of risk standards, and the over-confidence of decision-makers. Some of these barriers impacts have been discussed before in different contexts. Yet, this study investigates these barriers impact on preventing SMEs from investing in CRM. Also, to the best of authors knowledge, none of previous research has combined these barriers together with an insight to measure their effect on managerial decision-making.

We recruited 20 human subjects to perform the assembly tasks in collaboration with the robot. We trained the subjects to enable them to perform the collaborative assembly tasks, and evaluate cybersecurity conditions (status) of the collaborative system. Each subject performed the collaborative assembly separately with the robot. At the end of the assembly task, each subject was asked to brainstorm, write down the cybersecurity assessment criteria as best as he/she could perceive or realize through his/her experiences with the collaborative system, and rate the cybersecurity status of the collaborative system for each of the criteria (i.e., how capable the collaborative system was in fulfilling the cybersecurity requirements for each criterion) using a five-point subjective rating scale (a Likert scale), where 1 indicated the least and 5 indicated the most secured system. We then analyzed the responses and determined a list of the tentative cybersecurity assessment criteria with their relative importance (the total frequency of each criterion proposed by the subjects was to indicate the importance level for that criterion). We also proposed how machine learning and data analytics could be applied to analyze the cybersecurity metrics and enhance cybersecurity in the collaborative system.

The increase in the number of incidents has led to the emergence of cybersecurity - a new field of scientific and technical research that deals with the industrial companies security issues. Several widely discussed incidents are related to cybersecurity. For example, the STUXNET worm has infected Siemens industrial systems and inflicted heavy losses for the Iranian nuclear program. That worm made use of operating system vulnerabilities and the «human factor». The STUXNET worm has been also served as the basis for a number of modified viruses that have been used to successfully attack on various industrial networks. As Siemens is one of the world's key manufacturers of industrial equipment, the STUXNET has become widespread. Currently, many publications discuss STUXNET from different points of view. Researchers dealing with this problem often overlook the important fact that the existing standard communication protocols, interaction interfaces and embedded algorithms are in most cases unreliable and are not able to provide the proper level of security, but they focus on the vulnerabilities of intrusion detection and prevention systems.

IoT-enabled infrastructures have naturally a multi-layer system architecture with an overlaid or underlaid device network and its coexisting infrastructure network. The connectivity between different components in these two heterogeneous interdependent networks plays an important role in delivering real-time information and ensuring a high-level situational awareness. However, IoT-enabled infrastructures face cyber threats due to the wireless nature of communications. Therefore, maintaining network connectivity in the presence of adversaries is a critical task for infrastructure network operators. In this paper, we establish a three-player three-stage dynamic game-theoretic framework including two network operators and one attacker to capture the secure design of multi-layer interdependent infrastructure networks by allocating limited resources. We use subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE) to characterize the strategies of players with sequential moves. In addition, we assess the efficiency of the equilibrium network by comparing with its team optimal solution counterparts in which two network operators can coordinate. We further design a scalable algorithm to guide the construction of the equilibrium IoT-enabled infrastructure networks. Finally, we use case studies on the emerging paradigm of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) to corroborate the obtained results. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112627025

While numerous studies on digital forensics standards and curriculum exist, few, if any, have examined digital forensics courses offered across the nation. Since digital forensics courses vary from university to university, online course catalogs for academic institutions were evaluated to curate a dataset. Universities were selected based on online searches, similar to those that would be made by prospective students. Ninety-seven (n = 97) degree programs in the U.S. were evaluated. Overall, results showed that advanced technical courses are missing from curricula. We conclude that most degree programs evaluated offer legal/cyber law & ethics, investigative processes, and lab & forensic operations courses. The courses offered the least were memory forensics, Internet of Things (IoT) forensics, and program & software forensics. The data shows that some universities with the Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission (FEPAC) accreditation are lacking instruction in timely digital forensics topics such as memory forensics (0%), hardware security (0%), program & software forensics (0%), and ethical hacking (0%). Investigative processes (100%), network forensics (100%), lab & forensic operations (100%), and a senior design/capstone project (100%) are offered at all FEPAC accredited universities in digital forensics and digital evidence. Undergraduate degree programs with the National Centers of Digital Forensics Academic Excellence (CDFAE) designation had over a 50% offering rate for 11 out of the 22 courses we evaluated. However, memory forensics (0%) and IoT forensics (12.5%) were largely underrepresented. Our work provides an overview of the current state of digital forensics programs and discusses the importance of these courses to educate the next digital forensics workforce. © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112582916

In the last years, the number of cyberattacks has grown dramatically, as well as their complexity. Traditional cybersecurity systems have failed to detect complex attacks, unknown malware, and they do not guarantee the preservation of user privacy. Consequently, cybersecurity systems have embraced Deep Learning (DL) models as they provide efficient detection of novel attacks and better accuracy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent cybersecurity works that use DL in mobile and wireless networks. It covers all cybersecurity aspects: infrastructure threads and attacks, software attacks and privacy preservation. First, we provide a detailed overview of DL techniques applied, or with potential applications, to cybersecurity. Then, we review cybersecurity works based on DL. For each cybersecurity threat or attack, we discuss the challenges for using DL methods. For each contribution, we review the implementation details and the performance of the solution. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first survey that provides a complete review of the DL methods for cybersecurity. Given the analysis performed, we identify the most effective DL methods for the different threats and attacks. © 2021 IEEE.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111059104

While widely studied, the psychology of deception has largely focused on physical cues of deception. Given that present-day communication among humans is largely electronic, we focus on the cyber domain where physical cues are unavailable and for which there is less psychological research. To improve cyber defense, researchers have used signaling theory to extended algorithms developed for the optimal allocation of limited defense resources by using deceptive signals to trick the human mind. However, the algorithms are designed to protect against adversaries that make perfectly rational decisions. In behavioral experiments using an abstract cybersecurity game (i.e., Insider Attack Game), we examined human decision-making when paired against the defense algorithm. We developed an instance-based learning (IBL) model of an attacker using the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture to investigate how humans make decisions under deception in cyber-attack scenarios. Our results show that the defense algorithm is more effective at reducing the probability of attack and protecting assets when using deceptive signaling, compared to no signaling, but is less effective than predicted against a perfectly rational adversary. Also, the IBL model replicates human attack decisions accurately. The IBL model shows how human decisions arise from experience, and how memory retrieval dynamics can give rise to cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias. The implications of these findings are discussed in the perspective of informing theories of deception and designing more effective signaling schemes that consider human bounded rationality. © 2021 Cognitive Science Society LLC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110958901

The financial costs associated with data breaches are also growing. The costs associated with a data breach may divert resources away from patient care, thus negatively affecting hospital productivity. Objective: After a data breach, the resulting regulatory enforcement and remediation are a shock to a hospital's patient care delivery. Exploiting this shock, this study aimed to investigate the association between hospital data breaches and productivity by using a generalized difference-in-differences model with multiple prebreach and postbreach periods. Methods: The study analyzed the hospital financial data of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2012 to 2016. The study sample was an unbalanced panel of hospitals with 2610 unique hospital-year observations, including general acute care hospitals. California hospital data were merged with breach data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The dependent variable was hospital productivity measured as value added. The difference-in-differences model was estimated using fixed effects regression. Results: Hospital productivity did not significantly differ from the baseline for 3 years after a breach. Data breaches were not significantly associated with a reduction in hospital productivity. Before a breach, the productivity of hospitals that experienced a data breach maintained a parallel trend with control hospitals. Conclusions: Hospital productivity was resilient against the shocks from a data breach. Nonetheless, data breaches continue to threaten hospitals; therefore, health care workers should be trained in cybersecurity to mitigate disruptions. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

In respect of the engineering process, it is challenging to incorporate functional safety, safety of the intended functionality, and cybersecurity requirements into electrical vehicles. All of these aspects impact not only the vehicles or ECUs produced, but also the structures of the organizations by which the products are created. Based on current standards, drafts of future standards, and an analysis of the performance of a real design process for the ECU of an electrical vehicle, we propose an integrated design framework from the perspective of cybersecurity. Therefore, a stronger emphasis is placed on correct estimations of cybersecurity activity processes. As they affect all areas of development, these estimations cannot be isolated considering the ECU’s design process. More cooperation between various stages of the process is required in order to provide complete products at an early stage of design and development. The challenge is the identification of overlapping activities and the combination of design efforts in order to reduce the time and costs of an engineering project. A dedicated process entity will be proposed to an engineering division to manage cybersecurity processes. © 2021 by the authors.

This article gives an overview of a cybersecurity assessment process and an appropriate Cybersecurity Management (CSM) implementation for future digital agriculture applications. The cybersecurity assessment follows the IEC 62443 cybersecurity standard for Industrial Automation Control Systems (IACS), adapted to Agriculture Automation Control Systems (AACS). However, the research results showed application differences; thus, an expansion of the standard is necessary to fill the existing open security gaps in agriculture. Agriculture differs from industrial control systems because of the outdoor located field area, which requires other forms of security. An appropriate cybersecurity standard for the agriculture domain is not currently available. However, such a standard will be necessary to define generally applicable procedures to protect agricultural assets against cyberattacks. The cybersecurity standards and regulations existing today (2021) are not sufficient for securing the agriculture domain against new and domain‐specific cyberattacks.

Although organizations use technology protection diagnostic models to prevent such leakages, most diagnostic models focus on cybersecurity, and the evaluation system is complex, making it difficult for SMEs to use it. This makes them unsuitable for the general technology protection diagnosis of companies. Hence, this study proposes a diagnostic model that assesses these technology protection capabilities of organizations from personnel and administrative perspectives. Drawing upon the individual elements of the 7S model—shared values, strategy, structure, systems, staff, style, and skills—our model analyzes the influence of the elements on the technology protection capabilities of organizations. To determine this influence, the study conducts a questionnaire survey among 435 employees from large, larger medium‐sized, and small and medium enterprises. Using the partial least squares and the artificial neural network methods, the study determines the ranking of the relative importance of the 7s elements. The results show that the shared values element most significantly influences these capabilities. The remaining elements influence the technology protection capabilities in the following order from the greatest to the least effect: staff, strategy, structure, systems, style, and skills. These findings highlight the significance of developing an awareness of the necessity of technology protection among all the members of an organization. © 2021 by the authors.

The study of data breach risk assessment is a necessity for organizations to have effective cybersecurity risk management. Due to the lack of available data, it is not easy to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the interactions among factors that affect the cost of mega data breaches. The Monte Carlo analysis results were used to explicate the interactions among independent variables and emerging patterns in the variation of the total data breach cost. The findings of this study are as follows: The total data breach cost varies significantly with personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) with unique patterns. Second, SPII must be a separate independent variable. Third, the multilevel factorial interactions between SPII and the other independent variables elucidate subtle patterns in the total data breach cost variation. Fourth, class action lawsuit (CAL) categorical variables regulate the variation in the total data breach cost.

This intersection, which has been described as “biocybersecurity” (BCS), can become a major front of the 21st-century conflicts. There are three lines of BCS which make it a critical component of overall cybersecurity: (1) cyber operations within the area of BCS have life threatening consequences to a greater extent than other cyber operations, (2) the breach in health-related personal data is a significant tool for fatal attacks, and (3) health-related misinformation campaigns as a component of BCS can cause significant damage compared to other misinformation campaigns. Based on the observation that rather than initiating the necessary cooperation COVID-19 helped exacerbate the existing conflicts, the authors suggest that BCS needs to be considered as an essential component of the cyber doctrine, within the Defending Forward framework.

Their motivation for self-protection has therefore an important role in cybersecurity of organizations. Protection motivation studies in information security literature are largely based on the protection motivation theory (PMT) without proper adaptation to the organizational context. Additionally, only few studies consider the role of fear in protection motivation although PMT itself is based on fear appeals. This paper aims to revise PMT to better fit the organizational context of organizational insiders. A survey was conducted among academics (N = 255) at six Slovenian universities to reexamine threat appraisals of organizational insiders, and the mediating and moderating roles of fear of cyberattacks in protection motivation. CB-SEM analysis of survey data supports the distinction between appraisals of threats to the individual and to the organization. It also supports differentiating between perceived threats and fear of cyberattacks. Although we did not find support for the mediating role of fear of cyberattacks, perceived threats may mediate the association between perceived severity and vulnerability, and protection motivation. Only perceived vulnerability of the individual and perceived severity of consequences for the organization affect perceived threats. Perceived threats and measure efficacy influence protection motivation. Fear of cyberattacks dampens the positive relationship between self-efficacy and protection motivation. Self-efficacy influences protection motivation only when fear of cyberattacks is low. Interventions aiming to increase protection motivation need to focus on raising the perceived vulnerability of individuals, emphasizing the consequences for the organization, and increasing the efficacy of self-protective measures. Interventions aiming to improve self-efficacy may be effective only when there is low fear of cyberattacks and can be avoided when high fear of cyberattacks is expected. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107672216

However, malicious attackers can potentially launch falsified data attacks against V2I applications to jeopardize the traffic operation. To ensure the benefits brought by the V2I applications, it is critical to protect the applications from those cyber-attacks. However, existing literature on the defense solution that protects the V2I applications is very limited. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing a data-driven method to identify falsified trajectories generated by compromised connected vehicles (CVs). A trajectory embedding model, inspired by the word embedding model from the natural language processing (NLP) community, is developed. The proposed trajectory embedding model generates vector representations of vehicle trajectories that can be used to compute the similarities between trajectories. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, historical trajectory data are used to train a neural network and obtain the vector representations of trajectories. The second step computes a distance matrix between each pair of trajectories and identifies falsified trajectories using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has a very high detection rate (>97.0%) under different attack goals with varying CV penetration rates from 100% to 25%, while the false alarm rate remains low. It has great potential to be implemented in a wide range of trajectory-based CV applications such as traffic state estimation and traffic signal control, to safeguard the CV system from cyber threats. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106983028

To understand employee negative perceptions of SETA programs, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 Australian employees regarding their experiences with both SETA programs and non-cybersecurity related workplace training. As expected, employees had a generally poor view of SETA programs. They reported that the same factors that are important for effective non-cybersecurity training are also important for SETA programs, such as management role modelling and well-designed workplace systems. However, the level of importance of these factors differed across the two contexts. For example, employees indicated that the misbehaviour of their colleagues is a more important factor for their appraisal of a SETA program than it is for a non-cybersecurity workplace training program. Our results suggest that employee perceptions of SETA programs relate to their previously held beliefs about cybersecurity threats, the content and delivery of the training program, the behaviour of others around them, and features of their organisation. From an applied perspective, these findings can explain why employees often do not engage with cybersecurity training material, and how their current beliefs can influence their receptivity for future training. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105692468

Financial risks, as well as the potential physical damages, raise growing concerns about the reliable operation of the electricity market.

However, the lack of cyber-vulnerability analysis (CVA) hinders operators from systematically evaluating the real-time (RT) market-clearing model and identifying potential threats from a cybersecurity perspective. This article proposes a comprehensive CVA model for delivering a detailed analysis of four aspects of vulnerability: highly probable cyberattack targets, devastating attack targets, risky load levels, and mitigation ability under different degrees of defense. Users can simulate interactions between attackers and defending operators under different attack events, and the corresponding market settlements are also obtained. The proposed bilevel model is recast into mixed-integer linear programming through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

A PCS is an interactive simulation that allows students to “play” through an authentic scenario (case study) as a member of a professional team. We report our findings over a multi-year study of a PCS called Cybermatics, with data from 111 students from two different U.S. universities who interacted with the PCS. Cybermatics increased student understanding about certain key aspects of professional cybersecurity work, improved their confidence in being able to successfully apply certain skills associated with cybersecurity, and increased about half of the students’ interest in pursuing a cybersecurity career. Students also reported a number of reasons why their perceptions changed in these areas (both positive and negative). We also discuss design tensions we experienced in our process that might be encountered by others when creating simulations like a PCS, as they attempt to balance the authenticity of designed learning experiences while also sufficiently scaffolding them for newcomers who have little background in a discipline. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100745706

However, it is subjected to Sybil attacks that inject carefully designed adversarial GPS trajectories to compromise the data aggregation system and cause false traffic jams. Successful Sybil attacks have been launched against real crowdsourced navigation systems, yet defending such critical threats has seldom been studied. In this work, a novel deep generative model based on Bayesian deep learning is devised for Sybil attack identification. The proposed model exploits time-series features to embed trajectories in a latent distribution space, which serves as a basis for identifying ones generated by Sybil attacks. Case studies on three real-world vehicular trajectory datasets reveal that the proposed model improves the performance of state-of-the-art baselines by at least 76.6%.

Results show that broadly two types of users are considered: expert and non-expert users. Qualitative techniques dominate the research methodology employed, however, there is a lack of focus on the theoretical aspects. Moreover, the samples have a heavy bias towards the Western community, due to which the results cannot be generalized, and the effect of culture on cybersecurity is a lesser known aspect.

Whilst technology can reduce or remove some weaknesses some attacks specifically target human users. Whilst training can educate staff on how to behave more securely, this is often not sufficient to promote actual secure behaviours . Knowing what to do is necessary but not sufficient. It is also necessary to remove barriers to the required behaviour and to intervene in a way that affords behaviour change. This is particularly true in healthcare, where environmental factors including time pressure, and staff fatigue can create barriers for cybersecurity behaviour change. Technology and training are only a partial solution. Only by taking a more holistic approach which encompasses technology, people and processes and addressing the culture change needed to facilitate more secure behaviours will any progress be made in the workplace. We conducted a series of in-depth interviews and workshops with staff across 3 healthcare organisations in Italy, Crete and Ireland. This paper reflects on our main findings, including key requirements for future cybersecurity interventions. We used this reflection to develop a secure behaviour toolkit to help healthcare organisations identify problematic behaviours, co-create interventions to increase secure staff behaviour being mindful that sometimes culture change is necessary to enable the required security behaviours.

The paper aims to identify possible ways to increase the effectiveness of regulatory and ethical aspects of using neurotechnology in Ukraine’s advertising industry. Based on a systematic analysis of theoretical experience and regulatory legal acts, the main threats to the development of neuromarketing are identified. The lack of a neurotechnology law, the distinguishing between “neuro data” and “personal data”, cyber-hacking risks, the lack of an interaction model between the state and advertisers are deemed to be regulatory shortcomings. Possible ways to optimize the legal regulation of the neurotechnology use are the development of a neurotechnology law, the legislative enshrinement of the neuro data concept, the introduction of restrictions on neuro data use depending on the industry and purpose, increased cybersecurity level. Threats to the ethical use of neurotechnology include low public awareness of neurotechnology and personal rights of citizens, lack of training activities for marketers and advertisers in the field of neuroscience. It is possible to overcome ethical threats through educational and informational work for marketers, advertisers and citizens. A comprehensive solution to the ethical and legal shortcomings of neurotechnology use will increase the neurotechnology development level, the proficiency level of marketers and advertisers, as well as improve the legal system in Ukraine. © Oleksii M.

We hypothesized that wrist-based affective haptics should address both of these weaknesses in a form-factor that is practically deployable: i.e., as a replaceable wristband compatible with modern smartwatches like the Apple Watch. To that end, we designed and implemented Spidey Sense, a wristband that produces customizable squeezing sensations to alert users to urgent cybersecurity warnings.

Undeniably, digitization has led to revolution globally; however, the security threats, breaches, and subsequent losses indicate the need for a robust cybersecurity solution. Unlike classical intrusion detection systems (IDS), network IDS (NIDS) has been becoming more challenging due to continuous changes in attack-patterns and anomaly behavior. As solution data-driven machine learning methods have exhibited better by learning over network traffic information and detecting anomalies; however, its generalization over a network with both known and unknown patterns remains questionable. Moreover, most of the classical approaches fail to address the key issues of class-imbalance, level-of-significance centric feature selection, normalization and over-fitting problems resulting in different performance by varied machine learning models. In this paper, a novel and robust heterogeneous ensemble machine learning model is developed to detect anomalies in NIDS. The proposed model first applies sub-sampling to alleviate the class-imbalance problem of NIDS datasets. Subsequently, performing normalization using the Min-Max algorithm, it mapped the input data in the range of 0 to 1, thus alleviating overfitting and convergence. The feature reduction is used to reduce the features; it retained the most suitable features without imposing computational overheads, often in meta-heuristic-based approaches. Finally, the proposed NIDS solution designed a Heterogeneous ensemble learning model with J48, k-NN, SVM, Bagging, AdaBoost, and RF algorithms as base-classifier to perform two-class as well as multi-class classification over feature-selected NSL-KDD, KDD99, and UNSW-NB-15 datasets. Performance assessment in terms of true-positive rate, false positive rate and AUC revealed that the proposed NIDS model exhibited better performance than the standalone classifiers and superior to other existing anomaly detection methods. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112576167

Traditionally, signature-based network intrusion detection is employed to capture attributes of normal and abnormal traffics in a network, but it fails to detect the zero-day attack. The machine learning-based approach is attractive among various known NIDS methods to circumvent the shortcoming because machine learning based approach can efficiently analyze the big network traffic data and efficiently detect the zero-day attack. The imbalanced NIDS dataset does not provide better performance on practical implementation scenarios. Reducing the number of target classes into a new target class creates a balanced NIDS and improved classifier performance. In this paper, we present the efficacy of several machine learning algorithms, including Random forest (RF), J48, Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Network, Bagging, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) using network logs traffic (KDD99, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2017) using WEKA. This paper examined the impact of changing the number of output classes of the publicly available network intrusion datasets on sensitivity (True Positive Rate), False Positive Rate (FPR), Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and incorrectly identified percentage. Interestingly, the efficiency of these classifiers has increased, adding strongly correlated features to the target classes. The experimented results reveal that the machine learning classifiers performance improved when the number of target classes decreased. The addition of a highly correlated feature to the output class increases the performance of the classifiers. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112526437

Due to the high utilization of network traffic in the cyber world, conventional machine learning approaches used in intrusion detection systems are becomes ineffective. Recently evolved deep learning techniques are successfully applied in the detection and classification of threats at both the network and host levels, with a focus on deep learning. This study proposed an efficient IDS based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) via Bi-directional Long Short- Term Memory (RNN BiLSTM). The strategy uses a two-step mechanism to develop the expertise of the suggested solution to address network problems. This research aims to determine the algorithm's processing time and increase attack classification accuracy. The proposed model was evaluated on the CICIDS2017 intrusion detection dataset.

Recent IMD can be integrated in the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) and thus, they are also exposed to attacks impacting on privacy and, above all, on the health and even the life of the device users. While in an early stage of the IMD development, the security procedures were based on the existing classic protocols and models and their functional capabilities were the focus of development, recent efforts have been made to address security from the start. In this paper we review the most recent contributions on the cybersecurity of IMD products and we highlight innovative ideas that represent new design and development paradigms of these devices next generations. In this review it is reinforced that the technological evolution and the progressive access of attackers to resources capable of exploiting multiple vulnerabilities can have a crucial impact in the IMD already implanted in the patient's body, designed to remain in operation for many years. Also, it brings the need to develop novel and robust protocols to guarantee security compatible with constrained computing resources and extremely low energy requirements to be feasible.

This is a particular example of the problem of the security of stochastic control systems under erroneous observation measurements caused by malicious sensors within the system. In order to secure the control system, we consider dynamic watermarking, where a private random excitation signal is superimposed onto the control input of the flight control system. An attack detector at the actuator can then check if the reported sensor measurements are appropriately correlated with the private random excitation signal.

Furthermore, the design and development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often do not focus on security, leading APT to extend to IoT, such as the Internet of emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Whether malware with attack payload can be successfully implanted into UAVs or not is the key to APT on the Internet of UAVs. APT malware on UAVs establishes communication with the command and control (CC) server to achieve remote control for UAVs-aware information stealing. Existing effective methods detect malware by analyzing malicious behaviors generated during CC communication. However, APT malware usually adopts a low-traffic attack mode, a large amount of normal traffic is mixed in each attack step, to avoid virus checking and killing. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional malware detection methods to discover APT malware on UAVs that carry weak abnormal signals. Fortunately, we found that most APT attacks use domain name system (DNS) to locate CC server of malware for information transmission periodically. This behavior will leave some records in the network flow and DNS logs, which provides us with an opportunity to identify infected internal UAVs and external malicious domain names. This article proposes an APT malware on the Internet of UAVs detection method combining string matching and Fourier transformation based on DNS traffic, which is able to handle encrypted and obfuscated traffic due to packet payloads independence. We preprocessed the collected network traffic by converting DNS timestamps of DNS request to strings and used the trained random forest model to discover APT malware domain names based on features extracted through string-matching-based periodicity detection and Fourier transformation-based periodicity detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on the data set, including part of normal domains from the normal traffic and malicious domains marked by security experts from APT malware traffic. Experimental results have shown that our proposed detection method can achieve the accuracy of 94%, which is better than the periodicity detection algorithm alone. Moreover, the proposed method does not need to set the confidence to filter the periodicity with high confidence. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107462727

These devices are typically vulnerable to a wide range of cybersecurity attacks, attempting to manipulate sensing data. Most of these disastrous attacks would remain undetected since neither healthcare servers nor Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors are aware of the existence of attackers in the middle of communication. Thus, there is a need for a verification framework that various authorities can request a verification service for the local network data of a target IoT device. In this article, we leverage blockchain as a distributed platform to realize an on-demand verification scheme. This allows authorities to automatically transact with connected devices for witnessing services. A public request is made for witness statements on the data of a target IoT that is transmitted on its local network, and subsequently, devices (in close vicinity of the target IoT) offer witnessing service. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we develop a system architecture based on blockchain and smart contract that enables authorities to dynamically avail a verification service for data of a subject device from a distributed set of witnesses which are willing to provide (in a privacy-preserving manner) their local wireless measurement in exchange of monetary return; 2) we then develop a method to optimally select witnesses in such a way that the verification error is minimized subject to monetary cost constraints; and 3) finally, we evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using real Wi-Fi session traces collected from a five-storeyed building with more than thirty access points, representative of a hospital. According to the current pricing schedule of the Ethereum public blockchain, our scheme enables healthcare authorities to verify data transmitted from a typical wearable device with the verification error of the order 0.01% at cost of less than \ 2 for 1-hr witnessing service. © 2014 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099539294

The LSTM network is trained to predict un-sound statistical properties, which gets combined with sound statistical properties, to detect anomalies in IoT sensor data. Data smoothing using Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing is also performed, without loss of information, to improve anomaly detector performance. Using Precision, Recall, and F-Measure scores as metrics, results show efficient anomaly detection performance on IoT temperature sensor data. We, additionally, test performance by varying specific parameters.

They perform the challenging tasks of monitoring digital services such that when an attack is detected against the monitored digital services, they can respond swiftly ensuring cyber incidents are appropriately managed through to recovery. To monitor business services, the CSOC must first on-board those business services onto their security monitoring and incident management platforms. This process of onboarding business services to CSOC's security monitoring and incident management platform is described as Cybersecurity Onboarding. Cybersecurity Onboarding is a specialist technical process of setting up and configuring digital business services to generate appropriate interaction telemetry, such as events, logs, messages, metrics, and observables. These telemetric indicators when correlated and analysed reveal whether the business service may have been compromised or not. In this paper we rethink the approach to onboarding services to CSOC. A new approach of cybersecurity onboarding that is cyclic, simpler, quicker, efficient, and cost optimised by leveraging cloud-native and cloud-enabled technologies is discussed. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114204239

Work that previously had to be done physically on a facility, can now be conducted from remote locations. However, remote operations may lead to new vulnerabilities and risk. This paper presents results from a study on Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) consequences and cybersecurity in remote operation of oil and gas installations. The paper addresses digital technology that supports, controls and monitors industrial production and safety functions (Operational Technology), and not general (administrative) Information Technology. A main challenge in remote operations pinpointed in the study, is the increased complexity and interactivity for managing crisis situations. Thus, increased collaboration between operator companies and system suppliers should be facilitated, including regular physical meetings. The distinction between work process and work form is important in understanding the necessary reorganizing of work when implementing remote operations. Further development of cyber security practices should draw more heavily on the ideas behind the resilience concept.

The number of connected devices in the world and the anonymous structure of the internet enable this security deficit for not only computer networks but also single computing devices. With the connected use of computing device in anytime and anywhere conditions, lots of real-world activities are transferred to the digital world by adapting them to new lifestyles. Thus, the concept of cybersecurity has become more focused not only for security admins but also for academicians/researchers. Phishing attacks, which hackers mostly prefer to use in the last decade, have become even more harmful because its focuses on the weakest part of the security chain: computer user. Therefore, it is extremely important to prevent these cyber-attacks before they reach users. Based on this idea, we aimed to implement a phishing detection system by using a Convolutional Neural Network with n-gram features that are extracted from URLs. There are different n-gram feature extraction techniques, and in this work, it is aimed to determine which of them is more effective for our proposals. As a second goal, it is aimed to discover what parameters of the n-gram work best. In experiments, it is discovered that unigram has the highest accuracy rate. It was observed that, instead of all the characters that are obtained in unigram, the specified 70 characters (regardless of case sensitivity) give the highest accuracy rate of 88.90% with a High-Risk URL dataset. Experimental results also showed that a URL can be classified (either as legitimate or phishing) in about 0.008 seconds. These metrics can be accepted at a very good rate both in accuracy and run-time efficiency. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114473481

Providing supply chains with cybersecurity guarantees is becoming a highly topic in current research. This interest is mainly rooted on the fact that supply chains may include different vulnerable components, such as those residing in factories, distribution centres, logistics, or transportation, just to name a few. Moreover, most of these components are controlled by different IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, also becoming well-known sources of vulnerabilities, easing attackers access to the whole system. In this scenario, cyberattacks that use this weak link in a supply chain are increasing in the last years, as it has been largely reported in the literature. In this heterogeneous scenario, the key trend to facilitate cybersecurity provisioning sits on guaranteeing cyber-security in the entire supply chain, handled as a whole, that is, not separately for each individual component of the chain.

Recent literature presents a class of stealth attack to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) based on Real-Time Ethernet, where the attacker is able to affect the functioning of a plant by causing the selective loss of few frames on the ICS network. In this paper we demonstrate that the referred attack can be optimized in order to produce the same impact to the plant, but causing the selective loss of an even smaller number of frames in the network. The results show that the attack, which is based on Soft Computing tools, presents the same accuracy as its original version, however causing 13.8% less loss of frames on the network. The results show that the proposed approach increases the efficiency of the attack due to the lower frame loss it causes, which reduces the chances of it being perceived. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112044591

The paper used two methods; the first comprehensive sense and respond analysis investigated technology developers’ perceptions using the value propositions defined under the EU-funded H2020 RESOLVD project. The second method focused on customers and collected a survey which covered challenges, value propositions and preparedness to adopt new technology. The H2020 RESOLVD project has developed an intelligent low-voltage grid management system with storage. The results from the sense and respond analysis showed that most of the value propositions aligned with the responses from the broader survey which are needed within five years (e.g., improved power quality of grid, fault detection, reduced technical loss). However, the cybersecurity perception differed between developers and distribution system operators (DSOs). The customer survey highlighted that certain value propositions of technological solutions are needed more urgently than others, and therefore, technology developers should prioritize these in further developments. Regarding the use of flexibility to manage the LV grid, unclear regulations were expressed as a key barrier, thereby affecting business feasibility around battery storage. © 2021 by the authors.

Although hundreds of vulnerabilities are discovered every year, only a small fraction of them actually become exploited, thereby there exists a severe class imbalance between the number of exploited and non-exploited vulnerabilities. The open source national vulnerability database, the largest repository to index and maintain all known vulnerabilities, assigns a unique identifier to each vulnerability. Each registered vulnerability also gets a severity score based on the impact it might inflict upon if compromised. Recent research works showed that the cvss score is not the only factor to select a vulnerability for exploitation, and other attributes in the national vulnerability database can be effectively utilized as predictive feature to predict the most exploitable vulnerabilities. Since cybersecurity management is highly resource savvy, organizations such as cloud systems will benefit when the most likely exploitable vulnerabilities that exist in their system software or hardware can be predicted with as much accuracy and reliability as possible, to best utilize the available resources to fix those first. Various existing research works have developed vulnerability exploitation prediction models by addressing the existing class imbalance based on algorithmic and artificial data resampling techniques but still suffer greatly from the overfitting problem to the major class rendering them practically unreliable. In this research, we have designed a novel cost function feature to address the existing class imbalance. We also have utilized the available large text corpus in the extracted dataset to develop a custom-trained word vector that can better capture the context of the local text data for utilization as an embedded layer in neural networks. Our developed vulnerability exploitation prediction models powered by a novel cost function and custom-trained word vector have achieved very high overall performance metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and AUC score with values of 0.92, 0.89, 0.98, 0.94 and 0.97, respectively, thereby outperforming any existing models while successfully overcoming the existing overfitting problem for class imbalance. © 2021 by the authors.

China is unlikely to make concessions and the U.S. is unlikely to accept at face value any concession China might offer to make. Progress is also hampered by the outdated concepts used in bilateral cybersecurity discussions, such as stability, escalation, or deterrence. These terms are inherited from the Cold War and no longer provide a useful conceptual framework or lexicon. The most pressing issues are cyber espionage and political interference using cyber means. The prospects for bilateral agreement on these topics are limited. Both the U.S. and China lack incentives to reach agreement.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), as the widely used application layer protocol, is part of the main vectors for various malicious attacks. The previous detection based on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) relies heavily on packets, which leads to insufficient detection and a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we propose LIFH, a deep neural network model equipped with interactive information for detecting application-layer attacks. Firstly, the image reconstruction method is designed to reconstruct the HTTP traffic session into an image. Then, the latent features, instead of explicit features which are typically used in machine learning models, are extracted by HTTP-CNN in order to respond against forgery attacks. Finally, the high-level features are further fed to multi-classifiers to identify the traffic involved in malicious activities. We make exclusive experiments and evaluate the performance of LIFH on the standard dataset CICIDS_2017 and IIE_data collected from critical web servers. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly improve the performance of malicious traffic detection with an accuracy of 99.07% and a false positive rate of 0.40% which is superior to the state of the arts. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115702662

Thus, lightweight model is imperative, but there are very few applications of DL-based lightweight algorithms in NID models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight knowledge distillation (LKD) model for NID using the idea of knowledge distillation and separable convolution. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to use the knowledge distillation approach for NID. The experiment results show that the accuracy of the proposed approach reaches 91.46% and 94.30% on the KDD-CUP99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets respectively.

However, despite the valuable advantages, this new reality increases the cybersecurity and privacy concerns since vulnerable IoMT devices can access and handle autonomously patients' data. Furthermore, the continuous evolution of cyberattacks, malware and zero-day vulnerabilities require the development of the appropriate countermeasures. In the light of the aforementioned remarks, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), which can protect the healthcare communications that rely on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). HTTP is commonly adopted by conventional healthcare-related services, such as web-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) applications, while Modbus/TCP is an industrial protocol adopted by IoMT. Although the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods have already demonstrated their efficacy in detecting intrusions, the rarely available intrusion detection datasets (especially in the healthcare sector) complicate their global application. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that an active learning approach is modelled and adopted in order to re-train dynamically the supervised classifiers behind the proposed IDPS. The evaluation analysis demonstrates the efficiency of this work against HTTP and Modbus/TCP cyberattacks, showing also how the entire accuracy is increased in the various re-training phases. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115673242

Consequently, memory-safety errors continue to exist in production-software and are a principal cause of security problems.In our project at IBM, we worked on a minimally-invasive and low-cost hardware-based bounds-checking framework for preventing out-of-bounds accesses and use-After-free errors. The key idea is to re-purpose ""unused bits""in a pointer to store an index into a bounds-information table that can be used to catch out-of-bounds errors and use-After-free errors without any change to the binary layout.

The key insight of Talos is that domain names can be represented by feature vectors satisfying the condition that distances between the feature vectors can reflect whether they are of the same class. Talos uses a neural language model to extract the feature vector of a domain name. After that, Talos determines if the feature vector belongs to a class based on whether it is within the boundary of the class and near the centroid of the class. We evaluate the detection ability of Talos on both unknown and known DGAs. Our experimental results show that Talos achieves recall over 92% on unknown classes and F1-score over 95% on known classes.

Such applications are routinely subject to targeted cyberattacks, which result in significant loss of sensitive data (e.g., due to data exfiltration in advanced persistent threats) or valuable utilities (e.g., due to resource the exfiltration of power in cryptojacking). There is a critical need to train highly skilled cybersecurity professionals, who are capable of defending against such targeted attacks. In this article, we present the design, development, and evaluation of the Mizzou Cyber Range, an online platform to learn basic/advanced cyber defense concepts and perform training exercises to engender the next-generation cybersecurity workforce. Mizzou Cyber Range features flexibility, scalability, portability, and extendability in delivering cyberattack/defense learning modules to students. We detail our 'research-inspired learning' and 'learn-apply-create' three-phase pedagogy methodologies in the development of four learning modules that include laboratory exercises and self-study activities using realistic cloud-based application testbeds. The learning modules allow students to gain skills in using latest technologies (e.g., elastic capacity provisioning, software-defined everything infrastructure) to implement sophisticated 'attack defense by pretense' techniques. Students can also use the learning modules to understand the attacker-defender game in order to create disincentives (i.e., pretense initiation) that make the attacker's tasks more difficult, costly, time consuming, and uncertain. Lastly, we show the benefits of our Mizzou Cyber Range through the evaluation of student learning using auto-grading, rank assessments with peer standing, and monitoring of students' performance via feedback from prelab evaluation surveys and postlab technical assessments. © 2008-2011 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112421318

This paper provides a critical assessment of the cybersecurity practices of the transmission system operators (TSOs) from South East Europe (SEE) and the implementation of obligations for TSOs emerging from the complex set of cybersecurity and electricity legislation. The analyses of TSO cybersecurity practices are based on a survey conducted with the TSOs from SEE and show there is a lack of consistent cybersecurity policy at the TSO level. These analyses demonstrate that the differences between TSOs from the SEE region are not very significant with regards to implementation of technical protection and defense measures for critical infrastructures (CIs) and assets. The comprehensive analyses of electricity and cybersecurity legislation uncover the obligations of TSOs emerging from legislation and relate them to current TSO cybersecurity practices, confirming the necessity to boost existing practices. Considering the analyzed legislation and implemented practices, this paper presents a proposal for a cybersecurity framework for TSOs that should improve their organizational and operational response to the evolving cybersecurity challenges. © 2021 by the authors.

These distributed energy resources differ from traditional generation in many ways including the use of many smaller devices connected primarily (but not exclusively) to the distribution network, rather than few larger devices connected to the transmission network. DERs being installed today often include modern communication hardware like cellular modems and WiFi connectivity and, in addition, the inverters used to connect these resources to the grid are gaining increasingly complex capabilities, like providing voltage and frequency support or supporting microgrids. To perform these new functions safely, communications to the device and more complex controls are required. The distributed nature of DER devices combined with their network connectivity and complex controls interfaces present a larger potential attack surface for adversaries looking to create instability in power systems. To address this area of concern, the steps of a cyberattack on DERs have been studied, including the security of industrial protocols, the misuse of the DER interface, and the physical impacts. These different steps have not previously been tied together in practice and not specifically studied for grid-connected storage devices. In this work, we focus on grid-connected batteries. We explore the potential impacts of a cyberattack on a battery to power system stability, to the battery hardware, and on economics for various stakeholders. We then use real hardware to demonstrate end-to-end attack paths exist when security features are disabled or misconfigured. Our experimental focus is on control interface security and protocol security, with the initial assumption that an adversary has gained access to the network to which the device is connected. We provide real examples of the effectiveness of certain defenses. This work can be used to help utilities and other grid-connected battery owners and operators evaluate the severity of different threats and the effectiveness of defense strategies so they can effectively deploy and protect grid-connected storage devices. © 2021 by the authors.

This work underlines static and live digital evidence traceability challenges to further enhance the UAV incident response plan.

Additionally, this study discusses potential drone anti-forensic techniques and their association with the type of use, environment, attack vector, and level of expertise.

While automation can increase efficiency, it brings new challenges associated with guaranteeing safety in the presence of uncertainty especially in the presence of control system cyberattacks. One of the challenges for developing control strategies with guaranteed safety and cybersecurity properties under sufficient conditions is the development of appropriate detection strategies that work with control laws to prevent undetected attacks that have immediate closed-loop stability consequences. Achieving this, in the presence of uncertainty brought about by plant/model mismatch and process dynamics that can change with time, requires a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of attacks that can be detected with reasonable detection mechanisms and characterizing and verifying system safety properties when cyberattacks and changing system behavior cannot be distinguished. Motivated by this, this paper discusses three cyberattack detection strategies for nonlinear processes whose dynamics change with time when these processes are operated under an optimization-based control strategy known as Lyapunov-based economic model predictive control (LEMPC) until the closed-loop state either leaves a characterizable region of state-space or an attack detection threshold related to state estimates or state predictions is exceeded. Following this, the closed-loop state is maintained within a larger region of operation under an updated cyberattack detection strategy for a characterizable time period. A Taylor series-based model is used for making state predictions to allow theoretical guarantees to be explicitly tied to the numerical approximation of the model used within the LEMPC. A process example illustrates the Taylor series-based model concept. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104139414

E-health security risks have also risen significantly with the rise in the use of telehealth. This paper addresses one of e-health’s key concerns, namely security. Secret sharing is a cryptographic method to ensure reliable and secure access to information. To eliminate the constraint that in the existing secret sharing schemes, this paper presents Tree Parity Machine (TPM) guided patients’ privileged based secure sharing. This is a new secret sharing technique that generates the shares using a simple mask based operation. This work considers addressing the challenges presents in the original secret sharing scheme. This proposed technique enhances the security of the existing scheme. This research introduces a concept of privileged share in which among k number of shares one share should come from a specific recipient (patient) to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the original information. In the absence of this privileged share, the original information cannot be reconstructed. This technique also offers TPM based exchange of secret shares to prevent Man-In-The-Middle-Attack (MITM). Here, two neural networks receive common inputs and exchange their outputs. In some steps, it leads to full synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the specific rule of learning. This synchronized weight is used as a common secret session key for transmitting the secret shares. The proposed method has been found to produce attractive results that show that the scheme achieves a great degree of protection, reliability, and efficiency and also comparable to the existing secret sharing scheme. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103149740

With escalating threats in cybersecurity, various cryptography techniques were projected by researchers. The abundance of such mechanisms requires systematic investigation so that that appropriate method can be selected for diverse applications.

Numerous survey papers available in the literature for experimental comparison are devoid of many probable attacks such as anti occlusion attack, chosen-plaintext attack, jpeg compression, etc. This paper provides a qualified study of almost all basic, traditional, chaotic, lightweight, quantum, fractal, and qubit based encryption methods under the influence of prevalent intimidation (Salt & Pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, Rotation attack, chosen-plaintext attack, known-plaintext attack, and so on). We thus carried out an experimental and theoretical investigation based on statistical, differential, and quantitative analysis.

It is observed that the Quantum and Qubit based algorithms are superlative in comparison to others under the majority of extensive threats due to their sensitive behaviour towards initial conditions and highly random behaviour. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102954446

This calls for a thorough investigation and review of the weaknesses present in the distribution substations – the backbone of the grid – that can attract attackers to achieve their malicious objectives. The present survey deals with this issue and identifies both the common and specific vulnerabilities present in substations that can be exploited by potential attackers. This work approaches the topic, for the first time, from an attacker's perspective, in order to categorize the possible attack vectors that could be used to first access the substation network, and then disrupt the substation operations under the purview of IEC standards. The reported literature in the field was critically analyzed from an attacker's perspective to highlight the potential threats that can become a liability in cyberattacks on substations. Countermeasures pertaining to these cyberattacks are then detailed and the main elements required for a comprehensive electrical substation cybersecurity solution are finally outlined. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102061751

MMGs use many entities based on voltage-source converters to form the fully integrated power and energy system (FIPES). Having such a power and energy system for MMGs necessitates engineers considering cybersecurity and addressing its effects from the beginning of designing and building systems. Using innovative mathematical tools based on information gap decision theory (also known as IGDT), this research incorporates the data integrity attacks into tertiary controls of the FIPES of MMGs. The proposed methodology [named CA-tolerant tertiary control (CT2C) herein] is able to effectively find the most susceptible points of CA (PoCA) in MMGs when both severe and negligible uncertainties caused by CAs take place. They are able to include both severe data integrity attacks and negligible ones (or undetectable attacks). Here, the most vulnerable PoCA cause the most impactful changes in the tertiary control's principal objective, which is minimizing the operating cost of the whole MMGs. In this regard, this article describes a hypothesis, and in supporting that, comparative simulation results are given. The outcomes generated by the general algebraic modeling system (commonly known as GAMS) environment are able to provide researchers and engineers with appropriate maps for sensitive PoCA. Using the proposed CT2C, investments in MMGs cybersecurity will be more accurate and, more importantly, mathematically optimized. Finally, the potential ways to implement the proposed methodology are elaborated. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099575798

It is common that the asset owners and enterprise network operators need to work with cybersecurity professionals to manage the risk by remunerating them for their efforts that are not directly observable. In this paper, we use a principal–agent framework to capture the service relationships between the two parties, i.e., the asset owner (principal) and the cyber risk manager (agent). Specifically, we consider a dynamic systemic risk management problem with asymmetric information where the principal can only observe cyber risk outcomes of the enterprise network rather than directly the efforts that the manager expends on protecting the resources. Under this information pattern, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber risks by designing a dynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated efforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational behaviors. We formulate a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic contract design within the framework of a class of stochastic differential games. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the systemic risk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent’s hidden efforts. We characterize the optimal solution by reformulating the problem as a stochastic optimal control program which can be solved using dynamic programming. We further investigate a benchmark scenario with complete information and identify conditions that yield zero information rent and lead to a new certainty equivalence principle for principal–agent problems. Finally, case studies over networked systems are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results obtained. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088363770

Risk-based access control models provide many security solutions to risk management in dynamic environments such as cloud computing. This paper illustrates an extensive investigation to access control models and displays several risk access control models. Moreover, it looks at the possibility and challenges that make a risk-based access control deployed in a cloud computing environment. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113672748

One response to this problem lies in quantum technologies. In particular, the extreme sensitivity of quantum communication makes interference readily detectable and can provide secure encryption-key distribution. However, this is likely to benefit primarily high-value networks that use encryption, leaving insecure the growing use of mass networks for distributed work. The options to approaching this conundrum are (1) to accept where quantum technology leads, (2) to accelerate the technology in general without regard to how it is used, or (3) to push the technology to include mass use.

He later coauthored a book titled Where the Money Was. See FBI History of Famous Cases Criminals, https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases [accessed 1 March 2021]., the sector's global interconnectedness, and its high level of digitalization. In response, the private sector has invested vast sums into cybersecurity, and regulators have started to worry about systemic risk. The latter comes in two forms. The first is the risk of a successful cyberattack against a specific financial institution 'spilling over' into the broader financial system, hence unintentionally becoming systemic. The second is the national security concern of a systemic cyberattack launched specifically to disrupt the target's financial ecosystem and therefore the real economy. In both cases, the historic evidence is clear: neither type of event has been recorded thus far. Those who consider warnings of systemic cyberattacks to be little more than threat inflation see that as vindication. This paper takes the opposite view and argues that the probability of a systemic cyberattack is significant enough to warrant a higher degree of crossdisciplinary research and preparedness. To support its main argument, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that focuses on answering two key questions. First, are there sufficient known structural vulnerabilities in the financial ecosystem that could be exploited by a willing adversary? And second, are there plausible scenarios that could see an adversarial nation-state launch such an attack? The answer to both is positive. Given the lack of data, this analysis is largely qualitative, based on discussions with regulators, chief risk officers, academic experts, and the author's own multi-decade experience as an active participant in the financial market. © 2021 NATO CCDCOE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112299086

For some, the urgent need to communicate whilst safeguarding human life took priority over ensuring that these communications tools were secure and resilient. But as these tools become firmly embedded in everyday life worldwide, the question arises whether they should be considered as critical infrastructure, or perhaps even something more important. In a number of States, the critical importance of the environment for preservation of human life has been recognised by extending legal personhood-and thus, legal rights-to environmental entities. Countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, New Zealand, and India have granted legal rights to various rivers, lakes, parks, and nature in general. This paper explores the future possibility and cases where States may consider granting legal rights to other non-sentient but critically important entities. Looking into a future where human life becomes increasingly dependent upon highly interdependent systems in cyberspace, is there a possibility that these systems are granted personhood? Remote work and its cybersecurity implications could lead to an entirely new recognition of the importance of cyberspace dependencies and, consequently, a newlegal treatment. Against the backdrop of extended debate on the legal regulation of cyberspace, including the law of armed conflict, this would raise even more complex legal considerations, especially in the light of cross-border dependencies and systems that affect multiple jurisdictions. By way of cyber biomimicry, this paper adopts a blue-sky conceptual approach to studying policy considerations and potential implications if highly interdependent cyber systems in the distant future are granted the same protections as elements of the environment. © 2021 NATO CCDCOE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112257914

This paper argues for a conceptual step forward in disinformation studies, continuing a trend from the identification of specific pieces of disinformation to the investigation of wider influence campaigns and strategic narrative contestation. However, current work does not conceptually separate first-order forms of disinformation from higher-order forms of disinformation: essentially, the difference between disinformation about political or other events, and disinformation about disinformation itself. This paper argues that this distinction is crucial to understanding the extent and consequences (or lack thereof) of disinformation in international politics. The paper first highlights how political disinformation is often sparked by leaks-the release of secret or confidential information into the public domain. It suggests that disinformation and leaks intersect with conventional cybersecurity threats through the increasingly common phenomenon of hack-and-leak operations. The paper then introduces the concept of higher-order disinformation. This discussion is followed by an empirical example: the case of US intelligence assessments of Russian hack-and-leak operations during the US presidential election campaign in 2016. The paper concludes with offensive and defensive policy implications, arguing that the relevance of second, third, and higher orders of disinformation will only increase as more experienced actors draw on the material, successes, and lessons of previous campaigns. © 2021 NATO CCDCOE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112252217

Both unexpected technical design flaws and targeted attacks carried out by state-sponsored actors have raised challenges for the operators of essential services. Although this infrastructure is the subject of many regulations, and national security agencies pay special attention to such critical information infrastructures, gathering cyber threat intelligence is not straightforward for several reasons. First, special protocols in industrial control systems and operational technology (ICS/OT) systems are difficult to monitor. Second, information sharing does not really work, neither between states nor domestically. Third, due to the lack of thorough technical recommendations, there is no common understanding between responsible authorities and critical information infrastructure operators. In Hungary, key stakeholders of the national electricity system have realized that although some local and European legislation deals with the question of the cybersecurity of critical information infrastructure, many open questions remain in practice, both from policy and technology perspectives. In 2018, Hungarian manufacturers, energy service providers and responsible authorities started a discussion on what should be improved in legislation and technology, as well as in information sharing and how. This paper aims to describe the framework of this collaboration for information sharing and the initial results. Specifically, we present the current technical capabilities for gathering cyber threat intelligence in ICS/OT systems and propose some legislative actions that could support further technical solutions that are feasible in these special systems. We also present Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and the goals of threat actors in energy systems that can be seen from the current data sets of our honeypots. Moreover, we will also make some recommendations as to how the national and EU-wide legislation should be built up and what kinds of actions should be required from the key players in compliance with the Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (NIS Directive). © 2021 NATO CCDCOE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112250305

Such knowledge is essential in addressing the defensive measures that mitigate the attack. If the attacker enters in the network system, the game tree model generates resources by to counter such threat. This is done by altering the parity in the next game tree iteration which yield an adequate response to counter it. If an attacker enters a network system, and a game tree models the resources he must interface with, then that game tree can be altered, by changing the parity on the next to last iteration. This paper analyzes the sequence of patterns based on incoming attacks. The detection of attacker's pattern and subsequent changes in iterations to counter threat can be viewed as adequate resource or know how in cyber threat mitigations It was realized that changing the game tree of the hacker deprives the attacker of network resources and hence would represent a defensive measure against the attack; that is changing varying or understanding attacker paths, creates an effective defensive measure to protect the system against the incoming threats..

The multivariate measure of network flows are established to detect network attacks using the number of network flow variables smaller than a certain threshold and the absence of certain network flow variables in conditional variable values of multivariate data associations. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117797280

Conventional security risk measures are based on the point estimates of the likelihoods of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. Drawbacks of these measures are due to disregard for the tail risk, inherent inaccuracy of estimates of low probabilities, and reliance on the specific attacker(s) model. The recently proposed measure of cybersecurity risk - Cyber security Value at Risk (CyVaR), which is based on the VaR measure of financial risk, accounts for the tail risk. However, CyVaR still suffers from reliance on the specific attack model, and moreover has its own problems, e.g., it is not a coherent risk measure, which is currently considered to be a necessary trait of a risk measure. Following the recent trend of replacing VaR with the robust and coherent Entropic VaR (EVaR) as a financial risk measure, we suggest replacing CyVaR with CyEVaR. Using an example of a networked system and a highly motivated and capable attacker, we demonstrate that conventional risk measures may significantly underestimate the actual cybersecurity risk.

To ensure the targeted performance of such networks, diverse techniques were introduced to enhance system reliability. Many network designs have adapted the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide wider coverage and meet performance targets. However, the cybersecurity aspect of UAVs has not been fully considered. In this paper, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) module for UAVs. The IDPS module is trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically Deep Q-learning (DQN), to enable UAVs to autonomously detect suspicious activities and to take necessary action to ensure the security of the network. A customized reward function is used to take into consideration the dataset unbalanced nature, which encourages the IDPS module to detect minor classes. Also, considering the limited availability of resources for UAVs, a periodic offline-learning approach is introduced to ensure that UAVs are capable to learn and adapt to the evolution of intrusion attacks autonomously. Numerical simulations show the efficiency of the proposed IDPS in detecting suspicious activities and corroborating the advantages brought by the periodic offline learning in comparison with similar online learning approaches, in terms of accuracy and energy consumption. © 2021 IFIP.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113595142

Blockchain advocates argue that this technology constitutes a new architectural foundation for building trust based on its unique technological characteristics (Glaser 2017). However, cybersecurity is not a function of technological architecture but, in fact, is critically bound by human elements, processes, and actors. Therefore, all emerging technologies have cyber risk. Given the disruptive nature of this technology, there is a strong business need to understand cyber risk associated with blockchain. With this in mind, this investigation posed the following research questions: What are the risks associated with blockchain? Can a risk-based approach be validated or extended by exploring cases of blockchain deployment and highlighting risk? Multiple qualitative methods were used to analyze the data and to identify trends. This analysis identified cyber risk, in the context of blockchain, using the simple and generally accepted definition of cyber security as confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Based on the results, a cyber-physical risk-based approach was developed and blockchain deployment was examined in specific cases to identify and analyze the breaches according to this framework. The results demonstrate that beyond technological and data architecture there a strong need to further identify and analyze the cybercriminal actors and behavior in order to address cyber risk. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112165655

Therefore, the cybersecurity in smart home is a real concern for many reasons, and the conventional security methods are not effective in the smart home environment. Therefore, there is an insistent demand to detect these malicious attacks that target smart appliances in smart homes. This paper proposes a novel approach as a real-time cybersecurity monitoring system based on tracking smart home behavior. We utilize a Kalman Filtering algorithm to create an optimal normal behavior for the smart connected devices. Furthermore, energy consumption is utilized as an input to the proposed system, and the Shapiro-Wilk test to detect abnormal behavior. This composite approach leverages the well-known power of Kalman filter and Shapiro-Wilk test to guarantee the effectiveness of the approach.

However, this kind of detection requires heavy computing resources in reassembling packets and only well-known protocols can be interpreted. Besides, finding similar files from a storage requires pairwise comparisons. In this paper, we present a new network-based file identification scheme that inspects packets independently without reassembly and finds similar files through inverted indexing instead of pairwise comparison. We use a contents-based chunking algorithm to consistently divide both files and packets into multiple byte sequences, called chunks. If a packet is a part of a file, they would have common chunks. The challenging problem is that packet chunking and inverted-index search should be fast and scalable enough for packet processing. The file identification should be accurate although many chunks are noises. In this paper, we use a small Bloom filter and a delayed query strategy to solve the problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme that identifies a specific critical file from a packet over unknown protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can successfully identify a critical file from a packet. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111932943

Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being exploited as second line of defense, since this methodology helps in extracting non-obvious patterns from network traffic and subsequently in detecting more confidently new types of threats. Cybersecurity is however an arms race and intelligent solutions face renewed challenges as attacks evolve while network traffic volumes surge. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Clustering-based Intrusion Detection (Acid), a novel approach to malicious traffic classification and a valid candidate for deployment at the network edge. Acid addresses the critical challenge of sensitivity to subtle changes in traffic features, which routinely leads to misclassification. We circumvent this problem by relying on low-dimensional embeddings learned with a lightweight neural model comprising multiple kernel networks that we introduce, which optimally separates samples of different classes. We empirically evaluate our approach with both synthetic and three intrusion detection datasets spanning 20 years, and demonstrate Acid consistently attains 100% accuracy and F1-score, and 0% false alarm rate, thereby significantly outperforming state-of-the-art clustering methods and NIDSs. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111914671

Traditional video forensics approaches can detect and localize forgery traces in each video frame using computationally-expensive spatial-temporal analysis, while falling short in real-time verification of live video feeds. The recent work correlates time-series camera and wireless signals to recognize replayed surveillance videos using event-level timing information but it cannot realize fine-grained forgery detection and localization on each frame. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Secure-Pose, a novel cross-modal forgery detection and localization system for live surveillance videos using WiFi signals near the camera spot. We observe that coexisting camera and WiFi signals convey common human semantic information and the presence of forgery attacks on video frames will decouple such information correspondence. Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose features from synchronized multi-modal signals and detects and localizes forgery traces under both inter-frame and intra-frame attacks in each frame. We implement Secure-Pose using a commercial camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it in real-world environments.

More and more cyber threats come from new and unexpected sources, leading organizations and individuals to facing more security risks and vulnerabilities. Automatically obtaining and structuring security information from cybersecurity news can help security analysts to identify useful information more quickly. Most existing studies on extracting security events merely focused on the event detection task, aiming to discover and categorize cybersecurity events from the plain text. However, such event detection methods cannot capture useful information such as who performed the cyberattack, when the data breach event happened, who was the victim, etc. These arguments of a cybersecurity event are needed for analysts to get cybersecurity event details directly. Several studies have tried to extract rich semantic information of cybersecurity events, but they merely focused on extracting event arguments within the sentence scope. These studies still have limitations when the event arguments needed to recognize spread across multiple sentences. In this paper, we proposed a framework that effectively extracts cybersecurity events at the document-level from cybersecurity news, blogs and announcements. We model the document-level event extraction task as a sequence tagging problem. The goal is to identify the related arguments of cybersecurity events from documents. Firstly, we get the characters embedding and incorporate the word information into the character representations. Then we design a sliding window mechanism to get the cross-sentence context information. Finally, we predict the label of each character.

Equations of the models have been statistically characterized as nonlinear and non-Gaussian ones, where data have high variations between normal and suspicious data distributions. To address nonlinear equations of these distributions, a cuckoo search algorithm is employed. In this paper, the cuckoo search algorithm is effectively improved with a novel strategy, known as a convergence speed strategy, to accelerate the convergence speed in the direction of the optimal solution for achieving better outcomes in a small number of iterations when solving systems of nonlinear equations. The proposed algorithm is named an improved cuckoo search algorithm (ICSA), which accelerates the convergence speed by improving the fitness values of function evaluations compared to the existing algorithms. To assess the efficacy of ICSA, 34 common nonlinear equations that fit the nature of cybersecurity models are adopted to show if ICSA can reach better outcomes with high convergence speed or not. ICSA has been compared with several well-known, well-established optimization algorithms, such as the slime mould optimizer, salp swarm, cuckoo search, marine predators, bat, and flower pollination algorithms.

However, IoT-based critical infrastructures are an appealing target for cybercriminals. Such distinctive infrastructures are increasingly sensitive to cyber vulnerabilities and subject to many cyberattacks. Thus, protecting these infrastructures is a significant issue for organizations and nations. In this context, raising the cybersecurity posture of critical cyber infrastructures is an extremely urgent international issue. In addition, with the rapid development of adversarial techniques, current cyber threats have become more sophisticated, complicated, advanced and persistent. Thus, given these factors, prior to implementing efficient and resilient cybersecurity countermeasures, identification and in-depth mapping of cyber threats is an important step that is generally overlooked. Therefore, to solve cybersecurity challenges, this study presents a critical analysis of the most recent cybersecurity issues for IoT-based critical infrastructures. We then discuss potential cyber threats and cyber vulnerabilities and the main exploitation strategies adopted by cybercriminals. Further, we provide a taxonomy of cyberattacks that may affect critical cyber infras-tructures. Finally, we present security requirements and some realistic recommendations to enhance cybersecurity solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

Adversaries can perform a denial of service (DoS) attack based on the transmission of a large number of network packets, and a control-logic injection attack through sophisticated packet transmission. We propose an approach to detecting and defending against attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in a PLC system. In order to protect against indiscriminate packet transmission attacks that exploit uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities, an abnormal temporal behavior detection method is proposed that monitors the CPU usage of tasks. If a temporal anomaly is detected, the proposed approach tries to detect control-flow anomalies by examining the sequences of function calls, then detects stack-based buffer overflow attacks. The proposed method is implemented in a water tank control system for evaluation purposes. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the security of the system by detecting anomalies in temporal behavior with little system overhead. © 2021 by the authors.

Technological advancements often lead to new hazards. Coupled with the increased levels of automation and connectivity in the new generation of autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity is emerging as a key threat affecting these vehicles. Traditional hazard analysis methods treat safety and security in isolation and are limited in their ability to account for interactions among organizational, sociotechnical, human, and technical components. In response to these challenges, the cybersafety method, based on System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA and STPA-Sec), was developed to meet the growing need to holistically analyze complex sociotechnical systems. We applied cybersafety to coanalyze safety and security hazards, as well as identify mitigation requirements. The results were compared with another promising method known as Combined Harm Analysis of Safety and Security for Information Systems (CHASSIS). Both methods were applied to the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) use cases, focusing on over-the-air software updates feature. Overall, cybersafety identified additional hazards and more effective requirements compared to CHASSIS. In particular, cybersafety demonstrated the ability to identify hazards due to unsafe/unsecure interactions among sociotechnical components. This research also suggested using CHASSIS methods for information lifecycle analysis to complement and generate additional considerations for cybersafety. Finally, results from both methods were backtested against a past cyber hack on a vehicular system, and we found that recommendations from cybersafety were likely to mitigate the risks of the incident. © 2021 by the authors.

However, open banking is not without its share of challenges with, for example, the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU testing the cybersecurity capabilities of banks,1and the lack of enthusiasm by consumers to this 'game changing' concept slowing its progress and perceived success. As in the EU, in Australia the changes are driven by regulatory regimes, rather than the market, which sets the dominant agendas unlike in the US where they are market driven. The questions are how does each of the participants in open banking position itself within the new landscape and what can drive the further progress of open banking? This paper is taking an albeit brief look at the developments in the EU and Australia and looks at the issues of the past, present and future which need to be mastered in order to profit and function in the new regulatory environment. The lessons are that inaction - that is sitting on the fence - is dangerous and the time is now to plan and take action to occupy a prominent place in the open banking ecosystem before the arrival of the BigTechs and that acceptance by consumers is required in order for open banking to reach its full potential. © 2021 Centre for Studies in Australian Literature.

We propose a method that can verify both absence of runtime errors (i.e. crashes) and absence of privilege escalation (i.e. exploits) in embedded kernels from their binary executables. The method can verify the kernel runtime independently from the application, at the expense of only a few lines of simple annotations. When given a specific application, the method can verify simple kernels without any human intervention. We demonstrate our method on two different use cases: we use our tool to help the development of a new embedded realtime kernel, and we verify an existing industrial real-time kernel executable with no modification.

While interest in the application of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems in cybersecurity exists, endeavors in this sense are difficult to compare due to different choices of methods and tools. In this sense, we advance a typology of CSCL systems in cybersecurity and introduce an automated system, Yggdrasil, which identifies emerging vulnerability threats from tweets containing references to explicit news articles. Such a system can be used to enhance collaborative learning processes of experts and non-experts in cybersecurity regarding the early detection of vulnerabilities, by automatically extracting information from online communities. For this purpose, we built a corpus of 650 annotated tweets that contain links to cybersecurity related articles, posted by key profiles in the cybersecurity landscape. Using insights from state-of-the-art approaches in early detection of vulnerabilities from tweets and sentiment analysis from Twitter, we conducted two experiments for the development of Yggdrasil. Our results argue that the use of the BERT language model is an adequate approach for identifying relevant posts or news articles, having an accuracy over 91% in various configurations. Furthermore, we also illustrate the use of transfer learning as a viable alternative for the early detection of cybernetic vulnerabilities. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112109896

One of the most common cybersecurity attacks is social engineering, which depends on human physiology. The phishing attack is the most popular form of social engineering. The phishing attacks have many forms, but the traditional one from them is the messages. We need techniques to protect us from these attacks. Awareness, usage policies, and other procedures are not enough. Therefore, we proposed to use natural language processing (NLP) along with machine learning techniques for text phishing detection in this paper. We started with 6,224 emails from an existing dataset that contains both phishing and legitimate emails. NLP was used for preparing the data before extracting features from it and using the features for training the classification models by machine learning algorithm and for testing these models. The features were extracted using Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) in the Word2Vec algorithm. We training four models using four different machine learning algorithms which are k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Decision Tree and AdaBoost. The developed models had to classify the text messages into two categories, which are phishing and legitimate. While the dataset is unbalanced, we used performance measurements for unbalanced data in the evaluation process. Three of our models, that were trained by KNN, Decision Tree and AdaBoost algorithms, obtained considerable values while the MNB model obtained an insignificant value. © 2021, Engg Journals Publications.

This algorithm combines the domain knowledge of cybersecurity, taking in the vulnerability threat degree, vulnerability success rate, and host assets level as heuristic functions, to reduce the problem complexity and improve the path availability. Moreover, with the SMHA* (Share Multi-Heuristic A *, SMHA*) framework, a variety of heuristic information is combined to jointly guide the attack path search.

Both traditional rule-based malware detection methods or the heuristic malware detection methods based on machine learning are all need to extract structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of malware automatically or manually. With the game of cyber attack and defense, malware presents the characteristics of stealthy, polymorphic and multipartite. How to understand the malware accurately and effectively and extract the key malicious features is the main goal of malware detection technology. As a kind of important program understanding method, program slicing analyzes the program code by using the idea of ""decomposition"", and then extracts the code snippets that the analyst is interested in. Because the classic program slicing technology is mainly for high-level program languages, and malware usually does not provide source code, but only the binary code can be obtained. Therefore, the application of binary code slicing technology in malware detection technology faces the following challenges: (1) how the classical high-level language-oriented program slicing algorithm can be applied to binary code slices accurately and effectively; (2) how to extract the program slices that can represent the key malicious features as completely as possible for malware. Through the improvement of the classical program slicing algorithm, this paper effectively improves interprocedural slicing and slicing granularity issues. By analyzing the typical malware manually, we extract 42 slicing criterions that effectively characterize the malicious features of malware.

Objective: We aimed to identify the dimensional structure of emotion processes triggered by one of the most emblematic scenarios of cybersecurity breach, the hacking of one’s smart security camera, and explore which personality characteristics systematically relate to these emotion dimensions. Methods: A total of 902 participants from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands reported their emotion processes triggered by a cybersecurity breach scenario. Moreover, they reported on their Big Five personality traits, as well as on key indicators for resilient, overcontrolling (internalizing problems), and undercontrolling (aggression) personality types. Results: Principal component analyses revealed a clear 3-dimensional structure of emotion processes: emotional intensity, proactive versus fight/flight reactions, and affective versus cognitive/motivational reactions. Regression analyses revealed that more internalizing problems (β=.33, P<.001), resilience (β=.22, P<.001), and agreeableness (β=.12, P<.001) and less emotional stability (β=–.25, P<.001) have significant predictive value for higher emotional intensity. More internalizing problems (β=.26, P<.001), aggression (β=.25, P<.001), and extraversion (β=.07, P=.01) and less resilience (β=–.19, P<.001), agreeableness (β=–.34, P<.001), consciousness (β=–.19, P<.001), and openness (β=–.22, P<.001) have significant predictive value for comparatively more fight/flight than proactive reactions. Less internalizing problems (β=–.32, P<.001) and more emotional stability (β=.14, P<.001) and aggression (β=.13, P<.001) have significant predictive value for a comparatively higher salience for cognitive/motivational than affective reactions. Conclusions: To adequately describe the emotion processes triggered by a cybersecurity breach, two more dimensions are needed over and above the general negative affectivity dimension. This multidimensional structure is further supported by the differential relationships of the emotion dimensions with personality characteristics. The discovered emotion structure could be used for consistent predictions about who is at risk to develop long-term mental well-being issues due to a cybersecurity breach experience. © Sanja Budimir, Johnny R J Fontaine, Nicole M A Huijts, Antal Haans, George Loukas, Etienne B Roesch.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105766945

Detection of infrequent patterns is computationally expensive. Cybersecurity datasets consist of many features, mostly irrelevant, resulting in lower classification performance by machine learning algorithms. Hence, a feature selection (FS) approach, i.e., selecting relevant features only, is an essential preprocessing step in cybersecurity data analysis. Despite many FS approaches proposed in the literature, cooperative co-evolution (CC)-based FS approaches can be more suitable for cybersecurity data preprocessing considering the Big Data scenario. Accordingly, in this paper, we have applied our previously proposed CC-based FS with random feature grouping (CCFSRFG) to a benchmark cybersecurity dataset as the preprocessing step. The dataset with original features and the dataset with a reduced number of features were used for infrequent pattern detection. Experimental analysis was performed and evaluated using 10 unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. Therefore, the proposed infrequent pattern detection is termed Unsupervised Infrequent Pattern Detection (UIPD). Then, we compared the experimental results with and without FS in terms of true positive rate (TPR). Experimental analysis indicates that the highest rate of TPR improvement was by cluster-based local outlier factor (CBLOF) of the backdoor infrequent pattern detection, and it was 385.91% when using FS. Furthermore, the highest overall infrequent pattern detection TPR was improved by 61.47% for all infrequent patterns using clustering-based multivariate Gaussian outlier score (CMGOS) with FS. © 2021 by the authors.

As one of the most anticipated techniques in recent years, AM already made advances in design, production, and supply chain process of the manufacturing industry. AM is a digital manufacturing technology in which a massive amount of data is generated during the process. Accordingly, obtaining useful information from these data to improve current AM technology becomes a challenge. Meanwhile, Big Data research provides an ideal solution for dealing with the massive data obtained from AM processes. Besides the contributions in the AM research and production, Big Data analysis methods can also be used to help designers and engineers by collecting valuable information from clients and customers. From a business perspective, the manufacturing sector will benefit from the established Big Data sharing platform to promote and popularize new products. On the other hand, customers will obtain desired commodities with the help of a new-type 3D printing service system. The goal of this article is to summarize the contributions from the existing literature in the AM and Big Data field and prospect how Big Data methods can offer a better future for AM technology. It also introduces recent developments in AM technology combined with the internet of things (IoT), cloud, and cybersecurity.

With the increasing use of social networks, relationships from textual data can also be inferred from online interactions. Such interactions result in massive amount of textual data which is available in the form of text messages, emails, and social media posts. Identification and analysis of human relationships are useful for numerous applications ranging from cybersecurity to public health. In this paper, we present a method called RIEA (Relationship Identification using Emotion Analysis), for identifying relationships between multiple intelligent agents by analyzing the conversation between them. The objective of our work is to combine concepts of cognitive psychology and natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotions and map them onto a set of relationships and analyze how relationships transform over time. We employ psychological models to label a large corpus of conversations and apply machine learning techniques to determine emotion-to-relationship mapping. We use four distinct association classes and four attachment styles using best-worst scaling method for classification. Combining the attachment and association styles given in research literature gives us the relationship combinations for our analysis. Additionally, this work studies the most common changes of behaviors and emotions and the corresponding transformations in human relationships. Our results show that RIEA can correctly detect interpersonal relationships with an accuracy of 85%. The evaluation shows that RIEA can accurately identify interpersonal relationships from conversations and can be extended for identifying more complex relationships. This study also highlights the effect of changes in emotional behavior in the development of relationships over time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098772693

Currently, there is no commonly accepted methodology for cybersecurity professionals that considers one of the key elements of risk function - threat landscape - to identify gaps (blinds spots) where cybersecurity protections do not exist and where future investments are needed. This paper discusses a new, threat-based approach for evaluation of cybersecurity architectures that allows organizations to look at their cybersecurity protections from the standpoint of an adversary. The approach is based on a methodology developed by the Department of Defense and further expanded by the Department of Homeland Security. The threat-based approach uses a cyber threat framework to enumerate all threat actions previously observed in the wild and scores protections (cybersecurity architectural capabilities) against each threat action for their ability to: a) detect; b) protect against; and c) help in recovery from the threat action. The answers form a matrix called capability coverage map - a visual representation of protections coverage, gaps, and overlaps against threats. To allow for prioritization, threat actions can be organized in a threat heat map - a visual representation of threat actions' prevalence and maneuverability that can be overlaid on top of a coverage map. The paper demonstrates a new threat modeling methodology and recommends future research to establish a decision-making framework for designing cybersecurity architectures (capability portfolios) that maximize protections (described as coverage in terms of protect, detect, and respond functions) against known cybersecurity threats. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114198432

For effective and efficient vulnerability management, which requires extensive resources- such as time and personnel, vulnerabilities should be prioritized based on their criticality. One of the most common methods to prioritize vulnerabilities is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). However, in its severity score, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) only provides the base metric values that include exploitability and impact information for the known vulnerabilities and acknowledges the importance of temporal and environmental characteristics to have a more accurate vulnerability assessment. There is no established method to conduct the integration of these metrics. In this study, we created a testbed to assess the vulnerabilities by considering the functional dependencies between vulnerable assets, other assets, and business processes.

Undetected anomalies may lead to process failure, cause financial damage and have significant impact on human lives. Thus, it is important to detect anomalies at early stages and to protect data in Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we propose the novel on-the-fly NIST-compliant key generation scheme for a secure data container used to transfer and store sensor data. The data container delivers data from the low-level field sensors to high-level data analysis servers in a protected form. It provides data confidentiality and integrity, as well as data origin integrity, a fine-grained role-based and attribute-based access control. As a result, the anomaly detector runs on trustworthy data sets, protected from unauthorized adversarial modifications. Our solution can be easily integrated with many existing Cyber-Physical Systems and IT infrastructures since our secure data container supports RESTful API and is implemented in two modifications: (1) signed, watermarked and encrypted spreadsheet file; (2) signed and encrypted JSON file. In addition, we implemented several machine learning models based on a Random Forest, a k-Nearest Neighbors, a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network algorithms for the detection of various anomalies and attacks in a gas pipeline system.

RBAC restricts system access only to authorized users based on the roles and regulations within an organization. The flexibility and usability of this model have encouraged organizations to migrate from traditional discretionary access control (DAC) models to RBAC. However, this transition requires accomplishing a very challenging task called role mining in which users' roles are generated from the existing access control lists. Although various approaches have been proposed to address this NP-complete problem in the literature, they suffer either from low scalability such that their execution time increases exponentially with the input size, or they rely on fast heuristics with low optimality that generate too many roles. In this paper, we introduce a highly scalable yet optimal approach to tackle the role mining problem. To this end, we utilize a non-negative rank reduced matrix decomposition method to decompose a large-scale user-permission assignment into two constitutive components, i.e. the user-role and role-permission assignments. Then, we apply a thresholding technique to convert real-valued components into binary-valued factors. We employ various access control configurations and demonstrate that our proposed model is able to effectively discover the latent relationship behind the user-permission data even with large datasets. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104668388

In this talk, we explore the role of AI in strengthening security defenses as well as the role of security in protecting AI services. We expect that the scale, scope and frequency of cyber attacks will increase disruptively with attackers harnessing AI to develop attacks that are even more targeted, sophisticated and evasive. At the same time, analysts in security operations centers are being increasingly overwhelmed in their efforts to keep up with the tasks of detecting, managing and responding to attacks. To cope, the security industry and practitioners are experimenting with the application of AI and machine learning technologies in different areas of security operations. These include a diverse set of areas such as detecting (mis)behaviors and malware, extracting and consolidating threat intelligence, reasoning over security alerts, and recommending countermeasures and/or protective measures. At the same time, adversarial attacks on machine learning systems have become an indisputable threat. Attackers can compromise the training of machine learning models by injecting malicious data into the training set (so-called poisoning attacks), or by crafting adversarial samples that exploit the blind spots of machine learning models at test time (so-called evasion attacks). Adversarial attacks have been demonstrated in a number of different application domains, including malware detection, spam filtering, visual recognition, speech-to-text conversion, and natural language understanding. Devising comprehensive defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks by adaptive adversaries is still an open challenge. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the threat by adversarial attacks and developing more effective defense systems and methods are paramount for the adoption of machine learning systems in security-critical real-world applications. The talk will provide an industrial research perspective and will cover research conducted at IBM Security Research over the several years. © 2021 Owner/Author.",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104586592

However, the threat scenario development poses crucial challenges that hurt the learning process and trainee's engagement in training. Firstly, the threat scenarios are static and have limited applicability. Secondly, due to the lack of proper representation of procedures and training scenarios used in attacks, it is hard to recognize redundant procedures. We propose an Attack Specific Language (ASL) based on the Mitre ATTCK framework. It provides one representation for all threat scenarios. This language will give information about attack techniques in compact ways, which will streamline and automate the cyber range functions of threat and challenge execution. It will help identify and reduce redundancy.

However, it is limited in offering concrete frameworks specifically focusing on how to teach team collaboration skills.

The threats are getting stronger year by year. In 2015, the National Institute of Technology (KOSEN) launched the KOSEN Security Educational Community (K-SEC) and started cyber security training for KOSEN students. This project has two main purposes that one is outstanding cyber security human resource development which objects for improving quality and other one is fostering many KOSEN students who have systematically acquired security knowledge which objects for quantitative expansion. As part of K-SEC, research of cyber security human resource development education has been promoted. A new project 'Highly Advanced Cybersecurity for KOSEN (HACK) ' has been launched within K-SEC to accelerate the achievement of the two main purposes since 2019. HACK is a project based on the simple idea of strengthening KOSEN technical staff in order to foster strong students who have acquired practical cyber security skills. The plan is a three-year plan. HACK has three main objectives which are improving faculties ' and technical staffs' skills, the development excellent teaching materials based on the skills and to create both skills and human resources network. The success of HACK is important to contribute not only to security education but also to the examination of KOSEN or engineering education centered on practical education. In this paper, we will evaluate the effectiveness and legal theory of cyber security practice education for faculty and technical staff who participate the IT course in the first year. In addition, we will verify the effect of improving the skills of each faculty member in the off-season until the start of the second year. Furthermore, we will also consider whether the cyber security skills of the entire technical college have improved in the fiscal year. This year, we are proceeding with the project for the second year. In the second year, based on the results of the first year, we will evaluate, consider and examine for the improvement of the educational content toward the third year, which is the completion year. The evaluation includes the validity of the schedule. We also achieved a certain level of success in the development of teaching materials. This project is in good condition for the continuation of the plan and consideration of new items for the next year and after next year.

Therefore, CAVs expose a larger attack surface. In this work, we propose a threat model concerning the attacks that can take place in the community of CAVs by exploiting the Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication channels. Then, we simulate the proposed model using NetLogo (1000 simulation for each scenario). The adoption of multi-agent-based simulation allows us to abstract the nature of the attack, which leaves us to focus on the macroscopic effect of this on different traffic densities. The got results show that the more a CAV is engaged in dense road traffic, the more it is likely to be compromised.

This paper presents an overview of the AI-systems and technologies that can greatly benefit the security domain and its potential solutions for the aviation industry: anomaly detection for avionics, securing data link communications, and security certification, among others. As showcased in the “National Strategy for Aviation Security” report in December 2018 and the U.S. Government Accountability Office report “Aviation Cybersecurity” in October 2020, there is a need for resilient cybersecurity practices and approaches to address the current issues that aviation faces today. Designing and implementing solutions to address these issues without exploring the feasibility of harnessing AI-powered cybersecurity tools would overlook the potential advantages these technologies can offer. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a roadmap to adapt well-known ML-cybersecurity approaches to aviation security engineering and airworthiness: (i) autonomous and semi-autonomous cybersecurity for autonomous flight operations security, (ii) game theory models for adversarial and uncertainty modeling, (iii) human-AI interfaces for airport security monitoring and decision-making assistance, (iv) predictive analytics for anomaly detection for avionics and e-enabled aircraft, and (v) AI-based reasoning trustworthiness for software reliability and security certification. This paper also presents the challenges of including AI-cybersecurity in the aviation ecosystem to ground the proposed solutions within an accepted set of industry regulations, such as design verification for AI/ML algorithms and certification specifications for AI/ML solutions for manufacturers and agencies. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107592925

Although initial research has focused on static graphs in applications such as molecular design and social networks, many challenges involve temporal graphs whose topology and attribute values evolve dynamically over time. Sophisticated and unknown network processes that affect temporal graphs cannot be captured adequately by prescribed models. Application areas include social mobility networks and catastrophic cybersecurity failures. These web-scale applications challenge current deep graph generative models with the need to capture 1) time-validity constraints, 2) time and topological distributions, and 3) joint time and graph encoding and decoding. Here, we propose the ""Temporal Graph Generative Adversarial Network""(TG-GAN) for continuous-time graph generation with time-validity constraints 1. TG-GAN can jointly generate the time, node, and edge information for truncated temporal walks via a novel recurrent-based model and a valid time decoder. The generated truncated temporal walks are then assembled into time-budgeted temporal walks for temporal graphs under the learned topological and temporal dependencies. In addition, a discriminator is proposed to combine time and node encoding operations over a recurrent architecture to distinguish generated sequences from real ones sampled by a truncated temporal walk sampler. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that TG-GAN significantly outperforms five benchmarking methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Authentication systems mostly assume the existence of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) in the form of a Certificate Authority (CA) or as an authentication server. However, relying on a TTP implies that users do not directly manage their identities, but delegate this role to a third party. This intrinsic issue can generate trust concerns (e.g., identity theft), as well as privacy concerns towards the third party. The main objective of this research is to present an autonomous and independent solution where users can store their self created credentials without depending on TTPs. To this aim, the use of an TTP autonomous and independent network is needed, where users can manage and assess their identities themselves. In this paper, we propose the framework called Three Blockchains Identity Management with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (3BI-ECC). With our proposed framework, the users' identities are self-generated and validated by their owners.

However, allowing BYOD for healthcare workers comes at a cost, as it puts sensitive information assets such as patient data residing on personal devices at risk of potential data breaches. Objective: Previous review of the literature has highlighted the dearth of empirical studies in hospital settings regarding BYOD usage. As such, this paper aims to report BYOD usage trends in Australian hospitals through a national survey, first of its kind in Australia. Methods: An anonymous survey was conducted online among health IT personnel, asking them about their experiences about BYOD usage in their hospitals. 28 responses were collected based on public Australian hospitals, which included 21 hospital groups and 7 standalone hospitals, likely to represent more than 100 hospitals in total. Survey responses were quantitatively analysed through descriptive statistical analysis and cross tabulation. Results: BYOD is allowed in majority of the hospitals, and among all major staff groups, with doctors being the leading group. Participants ranked reasons for allowing BYOD, and most of them were related to improvement in clinical productivity, efficiency and mobility for clinical staff. Challenges were generally related to data security such as patient data breaches and compliance with data security laws, according to them. More than two thirds of hospitals had a cybersecurity officer employed, and CIOs were the most dominant group who held responsibility for managing BYOD within the hospital. Conclusion: This paper provides a starting point for better understanding of BYOD usage in a complex healthcare environment based on empirical evidence, one which highlights the security-usability conundrum, confirming previous literature themes. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105471114

Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAF) offer companies an efficient technique to manage their IT systems aligning their business requirements with effective solutions. As a result, experts have developed multiple EAF's such as TOGAF, Zachman, MoDAF, DoDAF, SABSA to help organizations to achieve their objectives by reducing the costs and complexity. These frameworks however, concentrate mostly on business needs lacking holistic enterprise-wide security practices, which may cause enterprises to be exposed for significant security risks resulting financial loss. This study focuses on evaluating business capabilities in TOGAF, NIST, COBIT, MoDAF, DoDAF, SABSA, and Zachman, and identify essential security requirements in TOGAF, SABSA and COBIT19 frameworks by comparing their resiliency processes, which helps organization to easily select applicable framework. The study shows that; besides business requirements, EAF need to include precise cybersecurity guidelines aligning EA business strategies.

With the increased need for cybersecurity in automotive systems due to the development of more advanced technologies and corresponding increased threat vectors, coupled with the upcoming ISO/SAE 21434 cybersecurity standard for automotive systems and cybersecurity regulations in UNECE WP.29, it is becoming increasingly important for auto manufacturers and suppliers to have a clear and common understanding and agreement of cybersecurity metrics for the development and deployment of vehicles. The main contribution of this paper is contextualization of existing metrics from literature and mapping out how they may fit within a standardized framework. We highlight the challenges to create awareness around the lack of common understanding and outline first potential steps towards a consensus. For example, one can consider assurance levels as a form of metric. Since guarantees of security are not possible, verification and validation methods such as various forms of testing can be used to give an assurance of security. For the automotive industry, there are discussions around cybersecurity assurance levels (CALs) which are outlined in an informative annex in the ISO/SAE 21434 draft standard. The CAL values are used to indicate subsequently increasing scope, extent and depth of assurance activities to be performed to achieve that level of assurance. A common understanding of the answer to ""how much cybersecurity is enough?""will inspire greater confidence in practitioners who design and test the technical measures, in industry with regards to a balanced approach to cybersecurity and ultimately, in consumers who need to know that the products that they buy will be safe and secure. © 2021 SAE International.

The underlying systems are susceptible to safety and cybersecurity attacks as the involved ECUs are interconnected. The security attacks can lead to disrupting the safe operation of the vehicle while causing injury to the passengers. Traditionally, the safety team performs hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA), while the security team performs Threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) in evaluating the risk associated with security incidents. The safety risk, calculated through HARA, does not consider the impact of security incidents on it. Similarly, the security risk calculated in TARA does not consider all the aspects of functional safety associated with the involved assets. Thus, the aim of the paper is to merge the impact of safety hazards and security attacks through a uniform framework, THARA. Consequently, the functional safety requirements and cybersecurity requirements can be aligned with each other.

However, low-cost embedded systems struggle with reliably capturing and encrypting all frames on the vehicle networks. In this paper, implementations of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms were used to perform envelope encryption of session keys with symmetric encryption algorithms while logging vehicle controller area network (CAN) traffic. Maintaining determinism and minimizing latency are primary considerations when implementing cryptographic solutions in an embedded system. To satisfy the timing requirements for vehicle systems, the memory-mapped Cryptographic Acceleration Unit (mmCAU) on the NXP K66 processor enabled 6.4Mb/sec symmetric encryption rates, which enables logging of multiple channels at 100% bus load. Using AES-128 in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode provides the encryption for data confidentiality. Errors and integrity checks are handled by a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) checksum withing the data and digitally signed SHA256 hash values of the overall encrypted record secured the integrity of the data. A hardware security module (HSM) is utilized to store asymmetric key pairs for key management. The HSM implements Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms for key exchanges and digital signatures. Secure collection and secure data uploads to a central server are demonstrated.

This single grid entity is widely used for furthering access to energy and ensuring reliable energy supply. However, if islanded, microgrids do not benefit from the high inertia of the main grid and can be subject to high variations in terms of voltage and frequency, which challenge their stability. In addition, operability and interoperability requirements, standards as well as directives have addressed main concerns regarding a microgrid’s reliability, use of distributed local resources and cybersecurity. Nevertheless, microgrid systems are quickly evolving through digitalization and have a large range of applications.

Due to the complexity and uncertainty involved, both qualitative and quantitative information can be useful in risk analysis and probabilistic modelling. Some methodological aspects of the functional safety assessment are outlined that include modelling of dependent failures or cybersecurity and verifying the safety integrity level (SIL) under uncertainty. It is illustrated how the assumptions in the process of risk analysis and probabilistic modelling influence results obtained and, therefore, potentially the decisions taken in functional safety management.

To meet the demand, we have to build a system that can understand every domain essential for building an inter-organizational system. ""Date"" and ""Timestamp"" reflect the root of the current term ""Date Trade"" in the cyber world. The threat to these roots has been studied in-depth and proposed solutions specific to UTC NPLI. The electricity grid shifts to the energy network to improve operating efficiency and reliability by developing advanced information and communication technology. However, the Internet also provides a range of entry points dependent on the internet, which produce additional vulnerabilities due to malicious cyber-attacks, thereby threatening Nations' economic health. This paper proposes therefore a new mechanism to protect critical infrastructure against these malicious attacks, based on interval state predictors. This paper uses the prediction-based approach for reducing the impact of such attacks from cyberspace. In prediction, we have used a machine learning approach like Bayesian classifier by Bayesian approach to forecasting time synchronization concerning universal time clock (UTC). In our analysis, we have taken the basic UTC, UTC, and UTC likelihood proposed approach on basis of communication.

At the same time, the maritime transport industry remains one of the most relevant and driving sectors for the global economy in terms of both the number and operations of active companies, and infrastructure and investments, thanks to the policies pushed to attract the latter. Maritime information systems, whether on board ships or in ports, are numerous, built with standard components available on the market and in many cases designed without factoring in well the ever-growing cyber risk. Digital infrastructure has become essential in operating and managing systems critical to the safety and security of shipping and ports. Specifically, Cyber-MAR is focused upon the simulation and emulation of the real world of maritime systems (e.g. Logistics, Supply Chain). This research effort will examine the creation of a federated Cyber Range (CR Cyber-MAR) which will include various platforms and interconnected systems on board a vessel or ashore, in order to allow a hyper-realistic simulation of cyber-attacks and trying to assimilate them into real-life. Then the identified CR Cyber range will be integrated in the Cybersecurity training needs for different levels of operators.

The methodology involves an initial anomaly detection step to see if the ART algorithm recognizes the behavior.

However, most cybercrime issues are characterized of being dynamic and not static classification problems where the set of discriminative features keep changing with time. This indeed requires revising the cybercrime classification system and pick a group of features that preserve or enhance its performance. Not only this but also the system compactness is regarded as an important factor to judge on the capability of any classification system where cybercrime classification systems are not an exception. The current research proposes an improved feature selection algorithm that is inspired from the well-known multi-verse optimizer (MVO) algorithm. Such an algorithm is then applied to 3 different cybercrime classification problems namely phishing websites, spam, and denial of service attacks. MVO is a population-based approach which stimulates a well-known theory in physics namely multi-verse theory. MVO uses the black and white holes principles for exploration, and wormholes principle for exploitation. A roulette selection schema is used for scientifically modeling the principles of white hole and black hole in exploration phase, which bias to the good solutions, in this case the solutions will be moved toward the best solution and probably to lose the diversity, other solutions may contain important information but didn’t get chance to be improved. Thus, this research will improve the exploration of the MVO by introducing the adaptive neighborhood search operations in updating the MVO solutions. The classification phase has been done using a classifier to evaluate the results and to validate the selected features. Empirical outcomes confirmed that the improved MVO (IMVO) algorithm is capable to enhance the search capability of MVO, and outperform other algorithm involved in comparison. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104777738

System resilience, defined as an ability to absorb, recover from, and adapt to cyber-attacks, has been studied less, and the situation is further complicated by the increased number of autonomous agents, i.e., hardware and software, which act on its own without human intervention. These agents can increase or decrease system resilience depending on their design and critical functions. Systems enabled with autonomous agents have the potential to respond to cyber-attacks with speed and scale that are unachievable with purely human defenders, but the mere presence of autonomous agents in the system adds vulnerabilities and can reduce resilience. Most assessment approaches have limitations with respect to measuring cyber-resilience, especially in systems with autonomous agents enabled with artificial intelligence.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no relevant review on this burning issue at present, and our review is the first work. In order to follow up on the latest research results in this field, this article first analyzes and summarizes the general malware attack process. Based on this attack process, this article locates the attack points and defense points powered by deep learning. The deep learning-assisted attack technologies are divided into five categories: (1) Automated virus evasion based on adversarial sample generation, corresponding to the ""preparation"" stage in the malware attack process, (2) Automated phishing based on natural language generation, corresponding to the ""delivery"" stage in the malware attack process, (3) Pinpoint and strike based on neural networks, corresponding to the ""impact"" stages in the malware attack process, (4) Traffic imitation based on generative adversarial networks, corresponding to the ""command and control"" and ""evasion"" stages in the malware attack process, (5) The black-box model-based attack intent hiding, corresponding to the ""evasion"" stage in the malware attack process. In addition, the deep learning-assisted defense technologies are divided into three categories: (1) Malware resistance based on deep learning, which is a defense technology for the ""engagement"" and ""presence"" stages; (2) Automated phishing recognition, which is a defense technology for the ""delivery"" stage; and (3) Malicious behavior detection powered by deep learning, which is a defense technology for the two stages of ""impact"" and ""command and control"". Secondly, based on the above classification, this article reviews the cutting-edge technologies in this field. Also, it analyzes these technologies in depth from different perspectives, such as technical principles, practical feasibility, and development trends. Furthermore, due to the accompanying security issues of deep learning is closely related to deep learning-powered malware security issues, this paper also pays attention to the accompanying security issues of deep learning and discusses the representative backdoor attack and defense technologies in this field. After that, this article analyzes and summarizes the main research directions in the field of deep learning-powered malware attacks and defenses, and discusses its future development trend. Among them, for the two new attack technologies ""pinpoint and strike based on neural networks"" and ""the black-box model-based attack intent hiding"", this paper analyzes and concludes that they have opened the first step for attackers to use neural networks as attack components actively. In the future, this will be a direction in which attackers are very likely to explore in depth and generate attacks, which deserves our attention. Finally, the research on deep learning-powered malware attacks and defenses is in its infancy, and more possible powered attack and defense points based on malware attack chains remain to be explored by researchers. Furthermore, a significant challenge for deep learning-powered malware attack and defense is the limitation of data sets. How to establish a valid and open data set for researchers to use is also a very worthy consideration and research. © 2021, Science Press.

However, the PQC protocols are based on conjecture that there are no polynomial time algorithms to break the PQC protocols. To overcome key challenges of both post-quantum cryptography and QKD, we propose to use the QKD only in initialization stage to set-up corresponding cybersecurity protocols.

Conditions uniquely found in the Adaptive Immune System (AIS) and Mirror Neuron System (MNS), termed the genomic immuno-cognitive system, coincide with three building blocks in computation theory of Gödel, Turing and Post (G-T-P). (i) Biotic elements have unique digital identifiers with gene codes executing 3D self-assembly for morphology and regulation of the organism using the recursive operation of Self-Ref (Self-Reference) with the other being a self-referential projection of self. (ii) A parallel offline simulation meta/mirror environment in 1-1 relation to online machine executions of self-codes gives G-T-P Self-Rep (Self-Representation). (iii) This permits a digital biotic entity to selfreport that it is under attack by a biotic malware or non-self antigen in the format of the Gödel sentence, resulting in the “smarts” for contextual novelty production. The proposed unitary G-T-P recursive machinery in AIS and in MNS for social cognition yields a new explanation that the Interferon Gamma factor, known for friend-foe identification in AIS, is also integral to social behaviors. New G-T-P bio-informatics of AIS and novel anti-body production is given with interesting testable implications for COVID-19 pathology. © 2021 by the authors.

With this goal in mind, a promising research field emerged focusing on creating and managing fingerprints that model the behavior of both the device actions and its components. The article at hand studies the recent growth of the device behavior fingerprinting field in terms of application scenarios, behavioral sources, and processing and evaluation techniques. First, it performs a comprehensive review of the device types, behavioral data, and processing and evaluation techniques used by the most recent and representative research works dealing with two major scenarios: device identification and device misbehavior detection. After that, each work is deeply analyzed and compared, emphasizing its characteristics, advantages, and limitations. This article also provides researchers with a review of the most relevant characteristics of existing datasets as most of the novel processing techniques are based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

People connect to the Internet for work, school, shopping, entertainment, and doctor visits, including psychiatrists. Concurrently, cybercrime has surged worldwide. This narrative review examines the changing use of technology, societal impacts of the pandemic, how cybercrime is evolving, individual vulnerabilities to cybercrime, and special concerns for those with mental illness. Recent Findings: Human factors are a central component of cybersecurity as individual behaviors, personality traits, online activities, and attitudes to technology impact vulnerability. Mental illness may increase vulnerability to cybercrime. The risks of cybercrime should be recognized as victims experience long-term psychological and financial consequences. Patients with mental illness may not be aware of the dangers of cybercrime, of risky online behaviors, or the measures to mitigate risk. Summary: Technology provides powerful tools for psychiatry but technology must be used with the appropriate safety measures. Psychiatrists should be aware of the potential aftermath of cybercrime on mental health, and the increased patient risk since the pandemic, including from online mental health services. As a first step to increase patient awareness of cybercrime, psychiatrists should provide a recommended list of trusted sources that educate consumers on cybersecurity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102144165

While forever more universal law venues such as conferences, edited volumes or research projects consider “the Internet” a peculiar, interesting aspect of its well-recognized disciplines, international scholarship fails to address the global network as a whole, stalling the application of the fully developed and well-suited international law apparatus to the global community's biggest contemporary challenge. “Internet governance” is still perceived by legal scholars as construed to international relations and, at best, a potential ground for soft law in a distant future. That is not the case: Internet governance, with all its challenges, has been shaping international law for almost two decades. The latest unveilings of the ways in which the Internet impacts global policies and laws caught the public eye with the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal and, previously, with the 2013 Snowden revelations, yet as surprising as they might have been to the average user, they are direct results of network's architecture and its governance model. This paper looks at the evolving concept of “Internet's public core” as an opportunity to bridge this dogmatic gap. We identify the scope and meaning of “Internet's core” and assess its legitimacy within existing international normative frameworks.

The findings are built on the self-reported response of 4,706 participants in a Stated Preference (SP) survey conducted between November 2018 and December 2018 in the United States. The findings show the response of drivers to the “Downtown Under Terrorist Attack” message falls into route divergence, speed change, and distraction, and the likelihood of route divergence, distraction, and a slowdown is significantly more than either stopping or speeding up. The possibility of a response, however, varies depending on socioeconomic characteristics, attitudinal characteristics, and driving behavior. It is highlighted (1) female and young drivers are more probable to detour, to change speed, or to be distracted, (2) drivers who are familiar with DMS, encounter it frequently, or pay attention to its content, have a higher chance of detouring or changing speed, while they are less likely to be distracted, and (3) technology-friendly drivers are likely to detour or slow down. From the distraction model, it is further inferred that drivers are distracted cognitively, visually, and manually. The findings have implications for researchers and federal, state, and local agencies who are aware of the consequences of cybersecurity threats for the operation and profitability of the transport network. They, for example, assist transport planners in prioritizing equipment security efforts and resource allocation to the areas of greatest risk, and help to prepare contingency plans based on drivers’ behavioral response. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101651219

We draft hypotheses regarding the actual disclosure of cybersecurity information and propose a research design of an exploring empirical study. The results of our study show that although there is no strict legal obligation to do so, 87% of the companies mention cybersecurity or similar words in their annual report in 2018. However, only 4 out of 75 companies disclosed more than six specific cybersecurity measures, while openness would generate the highest surplus for society from a social welfare perspective. Some major Dutch banks and employment agencies did not disclose any specific information with regard to their cybersecurity strategy, while those companies are highly vulnerable for cybersecurity incidents.

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has also increased the demand for low-power devices capable of connecting with each other or sending data to a central processing site. The IoT allows many applications in a smart environment, such as outdoor activity control, smart energy, infrastructure management, environmental sensing, or cyber-security issues. Security in such situations remains an open challenge because of the resource-constrained design of sensors and objects, or the multi-purpose adversaries may target the process during the life cycle of a smart sensor. This paper discusses widely used protocols that provide safe communications for various applications in IoT and also different attacks are defined. In this paper, to protect the IoT objects and sensors, we propose a comprehensive and lightweight security protocol based on Cryptographic Ratchets. That is, an encrypted messaging protocol using the Double Ratchet Algorithm is defined which we call Singleton, and the implementation of protocol is tested and compared to the implementation of the IoT standard protocols and a post-quantum version of the protocol. Various cryptographic primitives are also evaluated, and their suitability for use in the protocol is tested. The results show that the protocol as the building stone not only enables efficient resource-wise protocols and architectures but also provides advanced and scalable IoT sensors. Our design and analysis demonstrate that Singleton security architecture can be easily integrated into existing network protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4 or OMA LWM2M, which offers several benefits that existing approaches cannot offer both performance and important security services. For chat applications such as WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook Private Messenger, Google Allo, and Signal, a cryptographic ratchet-based protocol provides end-to-end encryption, forward secrecy, backward secrecy, authentication, and deniability. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089866870

This paper extends the Sifu platform with three challenges that specifically address embedded programming courses, and describes how to implement these challenges, while also evaluating the usefulness of these challenges to raise security awareness in an academic setting. Our work presents technical details on the detection mechanisms for software vulnerabilities and gives practical advice on how to implement them. The evaluation of the challenges is performed through two trial runs with a total of 16 participants. Our preliminary results show that the challenges are suitable for academia, and can even potentially be included in official teaching curricula.

Red teaming is a methodology used in the intelligence and military domains to understand external threats. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of red teaming methods, set out a framework for using them in financial crime compliance and provide practical examples of red teaming exercises, which banks can use to manage financial crime risks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides an overview of the financial crime compliance landscape in Australia. It outlines some of the key concepts and techniques used in red teaming, drawing in particular on the framework developed by strategic policy expert Micah Zenko. It explores the benefits of red teaming for financial crime compliance practice, concluding with three example exercises for financial crime teams. Findings: Based on this research, red teaming methods can assist banks in taking a proactive approach to identify and mitigating financial crime risks. Rather than confining red teaming to cybersecurity applications, banks should consider they can use red teaming methods in their financial crime compliance functions. Originality/value: This paper represents the first assessment of how to apply red teaming methods to risk management in financial crime compliance. It combines a historical and theoretical overview of red teaming methods with example red teaming exercises for money laundering, sanctions and strategic policy scenarios. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090784253

One of the most widely used techniques for solving cybersecurity issues is machine learning. From last several years, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques are suitable for solving security related issues. Machine Learning is most suitable for detecting phishing attacks because most of the phishing attacks have common characteristics. This paper has applied several machine learning techniques for detecting the phishing attacks. Here, two prioritybased algorithms are proposed.

Unfortunately, due to resource sharing, cloud computing platforms open the door for insider attacks, which consist of malicious actions from cloud authorized users (e.g., clients of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud) targeting the co-hosted users or the underlying provider environment. Virtual machine (VM) migration is a Moving Target Defense (MTD) technique to mitigate insider attacks effects, as it provides VMs positioning manageability. However, there is a clear demand for studies quantifying the security benefits of VM migration-based MTD considering different system architecture configurations. This paper tries to fill such a gap by presenting a Stochastic Reward Net model for the security evaluation of a VM migration-based MTD. The security metric of interest is the probability of attack success. We consider multiple architectures, ranging from one physical machine pool (without MTD) up to four physical machine pools. The evaluation also considers the unavailability due to VM migration. The key contributions are i) a set of results highlighting the probability of insider attacks success over time in different architectures and VM migration schedules, and ii) suggestions for selecting VMs as candidates for MTD deployment based on the tolerance levels of the attack success probability. The results are validated against simulation results to confirm the accuracy of the model. © 2021 ACM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104990743

Nowadays, companies implement security awareness using policies, procedures, and training sessions, to list a few. Traditional information security training sessions have relied heavily on presentation slides and videos. This paper aims to improve the employees' security awareness by developing an interactive video game, Cyber Shield Game, which includes various embedded threat scenarios. The proposed game consists of two levels. The Password Complexity Level trains players about password threats. The Physical Security Level aware the employees about storage and disposal of confidential documents. Further, two surveys, pre and post-game, are conducted to estimate the players' knowledge and experience level in cybersecurity threats.

It is a preventive approach entailing high organizational culture and education for information cybersecurity to enhance resilience and protect sensitive data. In an attempt to achieve high resilience of Smart Grids against negative impacts caused by different types of common, predictable but also uncommon, unexpected, and uncertain threats and keep entities safe, the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) Horizon 2020 project has created an organization-wide cyber hygiene policy and developed a Cyber Hygiene Maturity assessment Framework (CHMF). This article presents the assessment framework for evaluating Cyber Hygiene Level (CHL) in relation to the Smart Grids. Complementary to the SPEAR Cyber Hygiene Maturity Model (CHMM), we propose a self-assessment methodology based on a questionnaire for Smart Grid cyber hygiene practices evaluation. The result of the assessment can be used as a cyber-health check to define countermeasures and to reapprove cyber hygiene rules and security standards and specifications adopted by the Smart Grid operator organization. The proposed methodology is one example of a resilient approach to cybersecurity. It can be applied for the assessment of the CHL of Smart Grids operating organizations with respect to a number of recommended good practices in cyber hygiene. © Copyright © 2021 Skarga-Bandurova, Kotsiuba and Velasco.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117910824

However, significant opportunities may be lost by concentrating on the negative aspects of risk without bearing in mind the positive attributes. The objective of Project Risk Management: Managing Software Development Risk is to provide a distinct approach to a broad range of risks and rewards associated with the design, development, implementation and deployment of software systems. The traditional perspective of software development risk is to view risk as a negative characteristic associated with the impact of potential threats. The perspective of this book is to explore a more discerning view of software development risks, including the positive aspects of risk associated with potential beneficial opportunities. A balanced approach requires that software project managers approach negative risks with a view to reduce the likelihood and impact on a software project, and approach positive risks with a view to increase the likelihood of exploiting opportunities. Project Risk Management: Managing Software Development Risk explores software development risk both from a technological and business perspective. Issues regarding strategies for software development are discussed and topics including risks related to technical performance, outsourcing, cybersecurity, scheduling, quality, costs, opportunities and competition are presented. Bringing together concepts across the broad spectrum of software engineering with a project management perspective, this volume represents both a professional and scholarly perspective on the topic. Separates risk into two viewpoints: Positive Risk - an opportunity to the project - and Negative Risk - a threat to the project, which is a unique approach. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109242227

This increased demand is putting additional stress on supporting infrastructure like air traffic control, which is already struggling with outdated technology. The recent 737 MAX crashes also highlight the complexities surrounding the development of aircraft autonomy as well as testing and certification. In order to more precisely determine whether universities are keeping pace with both research and education needs from external stakeholders in terms of aerospace autonomy, we conducted a survey that targeted aerospace leaders in academia, industry, and government. The results show there is a significant gap between the education and research aims of academia and what is needed in industry and government. To fill this gap and maintain international superiority in aerospace autonomy, the US needs to promote the convergence in the fields of computer science and aerospace engineering, as well as safety, cybersecurity, and testing.

The user is considered to be anonymous in this setting, with no past behavior history available. Predicting anonymous users' next actions and their preferences in the absence of historical user behavior information is valuable from a cybersecurity and aerospace perspective, as cybersecurity measures rely on the prompt classification of novel threats. Our offered solution builds upon the previous representation learning work originating from natural language processing, namely BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Devlin et al., 2018). In this paper we propose CyberBERT, the first deep session-based recommender system to employ bidirectional transformers to model the intent of anonymous users within a session. The session-based setting lends itself to applications in threat recognition, through monitoring of real-time user behavior using the CyberBERT architecture. We evaluate the efficiency of this dynamic state method using the Windows PE Malware API sequence dataset (Catak and Yazi, 2019), which contains behavior for 7107 API call sequences executed by 8 classes of malware. We compare the proposed CyberBERT solution to two high-performing benchmark algorithms on the malware dataset: LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) and transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017). We also evaluate the method using the YOOCHOOSE 1/64 dataset, which is a session-based recommendation dataset that contains 37,483 items, 719,470 sessions, and 31,637,239 clicks. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of a bidirectional architecture over the unidirectional approach, as well as the flexibility of the CyberBERT solution in modelling the intent of anonymous users in a session. Our system achieves state-of-the-art measured by F1 score on the Windows PE Malware API sequence dataset, and state-of-the-art for P@20 and MRR@20 on YOOCHOOSE 1/64. As CyberBERT allows for user behavior monitoring in the absence of behavior history, it acts as a robust malware classification system that can recognize threats in aerospace systems, where malicious actors may be interacting with a system for the first time.

Cybersecurity relies on the timely discovery of potential and active vulnerabilities to mitigate threats, cyberattacks and theft of intellectual property. These vulnerabilities are commonly communicated via textual channels which can be mined and detected by information extraction techniques, such as Automatic Terminology Extraction (ATE), in order to mitigate imminent and future attacks. Distributed Specificity, a modern and highly effective ATE paradigm, was first introduced by [4], [3] and further improved by [21]. These methods, however, regard the context words linearly and indiscriminately, which 1) disregards the non-linear relations among the context words and 2) assigns an equal weight to each word edge in the sequence despite the fact that the connections of the nodes are not of equal strength. As our first contribution, the present article addresses this shortcoming by integrating the self-attention mechanism into the distributed specificity paradigm to enhance candidate terms' representation resulting in a more accurate extraction, which in turn lends itself to the higher coverage and a more timely discovery of cyberattacks. Since no ATE dataset exists in the cybersecurity domain, to the best of our knowledge, the present endeavor offers a dataset, as its second contribution, that will be the benchmark for our experiments and the ones to follow by both ATE and cybersecurity research communities. This complements the SemEval's SecureNLP [35] information extraction repository. We extend the MalwareTextDB (comprised of 147 cybersecurity reports) to include labeled terminologies as ground truth. The labeled dataset is annotated by cybersecurity practitioners using Term Evaluator [25]. Although for most industries higher coverage and a more timely discovery of cyberthreats will translate into protecting vital data, customer privacy, and sizable funds to name but a few advantages, in aerospace the risk and therefore the reward may be much higher directly resulting in saving human lives in both small and large scales. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111375448

A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. Phishing is the most commonly used social engineering and cyber-attack. Through such attacks, the phisher targets naïve online users by tricking them into revealing confidential information, with the purpose of using it fraudulently. In our paper we will be discussing and listing a few of the artificial intelligence models, that will help us to detect these phishing websites so that in the future these data and techniques can be used in machine learning to make our system better and efficient. The problem of phishing is widespread and there is no particular single solution available to effectively reduce all vulnerabilities, so many techniques are often used to reduce certain attacks. Machine learning is a useful tool used to reduce phishing attacks.As innovation keeps on developing, phishing strategies began to advance quickly several anti-phishing tools are available and have their own disadvantages. The paper concentrates on basic Machine learning supervised classification techniques to seek out an answer to phishing attacks. The Basic principle of this paper is to execute the frameworks with good efficiency, exactness, and cost-effectively. The task is attained by using 4 ML managed classification models. The four classification models are KNN, Kernel-SVM, Rando Forest Classifier and Decision tree. The supervised classification contains a labeled dataset that is used to train the models. All the four algorithms used: KNN, Kernel-SVM, Rando Forest Classifier and Decision tree are classification models. With machine learning, cybersecurity systems can analyze patterns and learn from them to assist prevent similar attacks and answer changing behavior. It can help users to be more active in preventing threats and respond to active attacks in real-time. So, by using Machine Learning, we could progress towards preventing such attacks. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104988645

There is consensus in the media and academic journals alike, that cybercrimes have incremented over the years. During the coronavirus pandemic in the year 2020, a global lockdown imposed by governments forced people to be homebound, leading to a subsequent surge in online users. This resulted in cybersecurity risk hitting close to home, with an upsurge in cybercrimes. This article attempts to make sense of the elevated cybercrime landscape. For the last two decades, criminological research have attempted to explore variants of technology-enabled crime and have examined theories to account for offending. This study proposes ‘Routine Activity Theory’ to explain the magnitude of cybercrimes during this unprecedented period that reshaped people’s routine lifestyles. Routine activity theory predicts that changes in opportunity situations (increase in online users), potentially escalates the convergence of motivated offenders and suitable targets in the absence of capable guardianship. Guardianship (security measures) is pivotal in this theory, to protect the targets (online users) from offenders (cyber threat actors). Furthermore, this paper offers practical security measures, in light of the specified cyber-attacks during this unprecedented period. If this theory is empirically validated, it offers opportunities to mitigate the extent of cybercrimes with an upsurge of online users, and more so for cybercrimes in general. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Sharing information on Facebook is becoming increasingly popular. Sharing text, video, voice, and pictures with unique content of the language-specific and sacred text, is becoming a trend. Consequently, issues of secure and trustable content have become increasingly important to all netizens. This issue has its foundations in the intention to share behaviour where the emphasis is on user security behaviour when sharing specific content. Method. The proposed theory was adapted and modified from previous research to empirically evaluate survey data collected from 154 Facebook users. A snowball sampling method was used. Analysis. A quantitative analysis was carried out on the data, which related to 154 Facebook users. This analysis used SmartPLS software. Results. The experience of information sharing was found to be an important determinant of personal outcome expectation as it explained about 89.9 per cent of the total variance. The ability to create and share information, subjective norms, feedback, information sharing self-efficacy, personal outcome expectations, and information security behaviour have become most important factors when intending to share specific content on Facebook. Conclusions. There is a theoretical understanding of security behaviour as a factor that promotes specific-content sharing behaviour on Facebook. © the author, 2021.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105171889

This traditional approach introduces significant risk as there is little in place to prevent the horizontal propagation of malware or other unwanted traffic within a given zone.

This article argues for an ""electoral ecosystem""approach to combatting the threat of foreign intervention in elections. Under an electoral ecosystem approach, the electoral system is viewed as an interconnected network of institutions, processes, and actors, all of which must coordinate together to ensure electoral effectiveness and legitimacy. An electoral ecosystem is comprised of multiple institutions and actors, including governments, political parties, voters, third parties, online platforms, and electoral management bodies. Given the interdependence and interconnected nature of an electoral system, there are multiple points of vulnerability that must be defended. An electoral ecosystem approach does not depend on any one single line of defense but instead relies on a multiplicity of strategies that protect the institutions and individuals that comprise the ecosystem. To further explore the electoral ecosystem approach, this article focuses on Canada's response to foreign interference in elections. The ecosystem approach consists of three principal strategies. The first strategy involves a set of new campaign finance regulations which directly prevents the influence of foreign individuals and groups on the election. The second strategy consists of new measures to reduce disinformation and to lessen its distorting impact on democratic discourse. To the extent that foreign election interference takes place through social media, efforts to reduce disinformation will also reduce the impact of foreign interference. The third strategy involves strengthening Canadian cybersecurity. A number of steps have been taken recently, including the coordination of Canada's security agencies and the adoption of new measures to prevent computer hacking and privacy intrusions. These three strategies, and the multiple measures within each, provide protection across the electoral ecosystem. © 2021 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102930409

Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment (CSRA) plays a vital role in the security protection of ICSs. To reduce the complexity of the modeling process in the dynamic CSRA, an association analysis-based CSRA approach is proposed in this article. It designs a three-layer association network (AN) to infer the probabilities of security incidents. The parameters of the AN are derived through mining the data of historical attack records. From a distance correlation analysis of the process data of the target system, an association matrix is obtained between the system state variables and the key security variables to quantify the cybersecurity risk of the system. A case study is conducted on a coupling tanks control system to demonstrate the effectiveness and timeliness of the proposed approach. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102730038

Meanwhile, insider threats are considered as a strategic and serious challenge in the cybersecurity research and have attracted increasing attention. In this article, the detailed model of load redistribution (LR) attacks against the power systems considering the presence of insider threats is developed. The LR attack problem is formulated with a security resource allocation game model. Information leakage of the system operator's defense strategy by the insider to the external attacker is considered in the proposed game model. The optimal strategies of both the system operator and attacker in the presence of the insider are calculated to maximize their own payoffs. In so doing, the impacts of the insider in the LR attacks can be investigated with the proposed security resource allocation game model. Case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems were conducted to validate the proposed model. The results of the case studies show that the information leakage by the insider will increase the payoff of the attacker in the LR attacks. The damage on the grid can be considerable even if the information leakage probability is small. The proposed defense strategy is able to reduce the expected operation cost of the system under the LR attacks with the information leakage due to the insider threats. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102011122

As it provides ubiquitous access to resources and replicated services, the threat for security remains firm for different applications. The concept of cybersecurity in the IoT-smart-city combination grants promising outcomes in securing the physical and service-centric resources from external threats. This article proposes to improve the protection of the IoT services in smart-city applications using replication-aware secure resource administration scheme framework. In a smart city application, which involves a cloud, based network, IoT platform, and distributed sensor networks guarantees differentiated protection mechanisms for replicated and non-replicated infrastructure. Instantly revocable security activities are used to prevent unintended attacks to the original resource supplier from monitoring non-replicated services. For this purpose, Naïve Bayes' diffusion approach is used to continuously evaluate the likelihood of disclosure of the repeated and unreplicated properties. The hazard and level of exposure for which prompted protection is assessed using the recommendations of the delivery system. The promptness of the security outcome is based on re-formulating permission delegations, security checks, and so on. This helps to leverage the security level of the available resources irrespective of the impact of the external threats. Besides, the proposed scheme improves the lifetime of the services with controlled overhead and service failures. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099912631

For performing an impact analysis, the transient voltage stability of the sensitive bus voltage is studied, followed by the quantitative assessment and severity ranking using the voltage profile index.

A comprehensive matrix of cybersecurity economic assessment based on threats, motives, impacts, challenges and economic impacts is provided in this paper. Cybersecurity risk quantification and their measurement and Cyber risk mitigation frameworks are also dealt with in this paper. Our cybersecurity risk Return On Security Investment (ROSI) model employs 9-parameters, while our dataset collection is classified into 11 types of attack profiles. The results obtained from Naïve Bayes classifier and CRQ using J48 bagging tree model yield a predictor accuracy of 82%, while the classifier correctly classifies instances in Naïve Bayes with a Receiver-Operator-Characteristic (ROC) area of 0.940 indicating the good classification of the sampled data; the prediction rate is 94.2% for the CRQ-J48. The ROC curve for the naïve Bayes classifier performs its best when the data is at 80% and performs worse when at 10%. Similarly, the J48 performs best when the data is at 85%-90% and worse between 5%-10%. While examining the cost of the data breach of a single instance of compromise, it can be estimated that web server has the maximum exposure and hence the cost of a breach is approximately estimated to be around 19 million dollars in our dataset. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103904417

With the increase of the application of IoT in the fields of networked mobile robotics, Smart Grid, etc., the concern about the security protocols also rises along with it. Cybersecurity is one of the most important network security protocols for the safety of IoT-enabled devices as all the devices are connected and inter-exchanging various data over the internet. Various encryption algorithms for securing data in cybersecurity management are already in existence. RSA, ECC, and other existing encryption algorithms are frequently used in various fields of IoT applications such, however, they have many shortcomings. Among the existing algorithm, AES is one of the best algorithms because it can provide an excellent level of security and its encryption speed is much faster than others. But AES is vulnerable to Key Recovery Attack. In order to overcome this shortcoming and to provide a more secured security protocol, Hybrid Encryption Algorithm (HEA) has been introduced in this paper and implemented in an ESP32 based IoT-enabled mobile robot. The HEA consist of base64 and AES, which is double-layered encryption for data security. The level of security is much higher than the commonly used encryption algorithm. The complexity and runtime are less than other encryption topology.

The capturing of digital evidence, which is a tangible and probative piece of information that can be presented in court and used in trial, is very challenging due to its volatility and improper handling procedures. When computer systems get compromised, digital forensics comes into play to analyze, discover, extract, and preserve all relevant evidence. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain efficient evidence management to guarantee the credibility and admissibility of digital evidence in a court of law. A critical component of this process is to utilize an adequate chain of custody (CoC) approach to preserve the evidence in its original state from compromise and/or contamination. In this paper, a practical and secure CustodyBlock (CB) model using private blockchain protocol and smart contracts to support the control, transfer, analysis, and preservation monitoring is proposed. The smart contracts in CB are utilized to enhance the model automation process for better and more secure evidence preservation and handling.

Unfortunately, ADS-B is prone to cyber-attacks. To verify the ADS-B positioning data of aircraft, multilateration (MLAT) techniques that use Time Differences of Arrivals (TDoAs) have been proposed. MLAT exhibits low accuracy in determining aircraft positions. Recently, a novel technique using a theoretically calculated TDoA fingerprint map has been proposed. This technique is less dependent on the geometry of sensor deployment and achieves better accuracy than MLAT. However, the accuracy of the existing technique is not sufficiently precise for determining aircraft positions and requires a long computation time. In contrast, this paper presents a reliable surveillance framework using an Actual TDoA-Based Augmentation System (ATBAS). It uses historically recorded real-data from the OpenSky network to train our TDoA fingerprint grid network. Our results show that the accuracy of the proposed ATBAS framework in determining the aircraft positions is significantly better than those of the MLAT and expected TDoA techniques by 56.93% and 48.86%, respectively.

Thus Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) setting emerge to enable work flexibility and technological compatibility. For management, employees' productivity is important, but they could not jeopardise the security of information and data stored in the corporate network. Securing data and network becomes more complex tasks as it deals with foreign devices, i.e., devices that do not belong to the organisation. With much research focused on pre-implementation and the technical aspects of mobile device usage, post-implementation advancement is receiving less attention. IS audit as one of the post-implementation mechanisms provides performance evaluation of existing IS assets, business operations and process implementation, thus helping management formulating the best strategies in optimising IS practices. This paper discusses the feasibility of IS audit in assessing mobile device security by exploring the risks and vulnerabilities of mobile devices for organisational IS security as well as the perception of Information system management in mobile device security. By analysing related literature, authors pointed out how the references used in the current IS audit research address the mobile device security.

The increasing numbers of cyber-attacks indicate that the traditional methodologies of training and awareness are still insufficient to build the necessary cybersecurity skills and capabilities. Gamification represents a promising methodology to change the behavior of people in the early stages. The objective of this research is not only to verify the effectiveness of gamification but also to provide a constructive application and to propose a framework that helps eventually and iteratively in improving the cyber-security skills and capabilities for high school students in early stages. In this research, we propose a novel framework for information security awareness and training programs, known as Cyber-Hero, that will help fight one of the most popular weaknesses in cybersecurity which is human error. The framework helps in transferring the learning of a narrative set of instructions to be acquired in a serious game, in which students in schools can engage with at an early stage. Such an engagement will educate students on how to create a strong password to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. The preliminary results show incremental progress in the skills and capabilities of cybersecurity for the students using the proposed framework. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103470831

However, the digital infrastructure used in an MG to relay sensory information and perform control commands can potentially be compromised due to a cyberattack from a capable adversary. An MG operator is interested in knowing the inherent vulnerabilities in their system and should regularly perform Penetration Testing (PT) activities to prepare for such an event. PT generally involves looking for defensive coverage blind spots in software and hardware infrastructure, however the logic in control algorithms which act upon sensory information should also be considered in PT activities. This paper demonstrates a case study of PT for an MG control algorithm by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to uncover malicious input which compromises the effectiveness of the controller. Through trial-and-error episodic interactions with a simulated MG, we train an RL agent to find malicious input which reduces the effectiveness of the MG controller. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103443594

In this study, attack testing was carried out using three DoS tools, namely the LOIC, Torshammer, and Xerxes tools, with a test scenario using IDS and without IDS. From the test results that have been carried out, IDS has successfully detected the attacks that were sent, for the delivery of the most consecutive attack packages, namely Torshammer, Xerxes, and LOIC. In the detection of Torshammer attack tools on the target FTP Server, 9421 packages were obtained, for Xerxes tools as many as 10618 packages and LOIC tools as many as 6115 packages.

We argue that a first important step towards such CCTV-aware solutions must be a mapping system (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) that provides both privacy and safety routing and navigation options. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are no mapping nor navigation systems that support CCTV-privacy and CCTV-safety routing options. At the same time, in order to move the privacy vs. safety debate related to CCTV surveillance cameras from purely subjective to data-driven and evidence-based domain, it would require to implement and evaluate a globally-relevant CCTV-aware routing and navigation system. This however, would require a tremendous initial effort without any guarantees about the feasibility and the end result. Therefore, we propose first a p reliminary evaluation of such CCTV-aware technology at a small scale, for example a medium-sized European city. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a CCTV-aware routing and navigation solution. The aim of this feasibility exploration is to understand what are the main impacts of CCTV on privacy, and what are the challenges and benefits to building such technology. We evaluate our approach on six (6) pedestrian walking routes within the downtown area of the city of Jyvaskyla, Finland. We first map a total of 450 CCTV cameras, and then experiment with routing and navigation under several different configurations to coarsely model the possible cameras' parameters and coverage from the real-world. We report two main results. First, our preliminary findings support the overall feasibility of our approach. Second, the results also reveal a data-driven worrying reality for persons wishing to preserve their privacy/anonymity as their main living choice. When modelling cameras at their low performance end, a privacy-preserving route has on average a 1.5x distance increase when compared to generic routing. When modelling cameras at their medium-to-high performance end, a privacy-preserving route has on average a 5.0x distance increase, while in some cases there are no routes possible at all, i.e., privacy/anonymity must be given up to reach the destination. These results further support and encourage both global mapping of CCTV cameras and refinements to camera modelling and underlying technology in the context of more accurate CCTV-aware routing and navigation. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

One of such sources is history, intended as the knowledge about past cyber-security incidents, their size, type of attacks, industry sector and so on. Ideally, having a large enough dataset of past security incidents, it would be possible to analyze it with automated tools and draw conclusions that may help in preventing future incidents. Unfortunately, it seems that there are only a few publicly available datasets of this kind that are of good quality. The paper reports our initial efforts in collecting all publicly available security incidents datasets, and building a single, large dataset that can be used to draw statistically significant observations. In order to argue about its statistical quality, we analyze the resulting combined dataset against the original ones.

These domain names are used to evade domain based security detection and mitigation controls. Reverse engineering of malware samples to discover the DGA algorithm and seed to generate the list of domains is one of the techniques used to detect DGA domains. These domains are subsequently preregistered and sinkholed, or published on security device blacklists to mitigate malicious activity. This technique is time-consuming and can be easily circumvented by attackers and malware authors. Statistical analysis is also used to identify DGA domains over a time window, however many of these techniques need contextual information which is not easily or feasibly obtained. Existing studies have also demonstrated the use of traditional machine learning techniques to detect DGA domains. Our goal was to detect DGA domains on a per domain basis using the domain name only, with no additional information. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture for the detection of DGA domains without the need for contextual information or manually created features.

To achieve this goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore, apart from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud game-based architecture covers all phases from game creation to the final users’ interactions with the game. © 2021 by the authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099809051

While facilitating the dissemination of content to users and making better use of the network resources, ICN is also vulnerable in that attackers can inject poisoned content into the network and isolate users from valid content sources. The introduction of signature verification in each router can effectively prevent this attack, but it also introduces great computation overhead. Existing schemes in ICN reduce verification overhead from a single routing perspective but do not consider integrating resources within ICN for collaborative content authentication and cyber self-defense. In this paper, we propose a collaborative, secure, and efficient content validation protection framework, named CSEVP, to implement a multi-router collaborative defense mechanism for ICN. On the one hand, we conduct content verification by probabilistically choosing one router involved in the transmission path to offload the computation overhead of content verification from a single router to multiple ones. On the other hand, we adopt bloom filters for routers to record and share verification results to further facilitate a more efficient content validity verification. The security and efficiency analysis shows that our proposed CSEVP can achieve efficient content validity verification among multiple routers with acceptable low communication and storage overhead.

In software development, agile methods are increasingly adopted in critical software projects where security risks are prominent challenges. This adoption stems from the fact that agile methods are highly iterative and support delivering services and products in smaller batches which allows security professionals to seamlessly integrate software development security activities with agile methodologies. In addition, the iterative nature of agile software development encourages frequent inspections, tests, and patching of software systems to mitigate cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. Considering the massive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) products, the challenge of software development while addressing the security and safety concerns of these devices will continue to increase. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed review of agile software development in the context of IoT, ITS, and their cybersecurity and risk challenges. Furthermore, we provide a systematic comparison of the reviewed literature based on a set of defined criteria. Finally, we provide a broader outlook and an outline for designing future security-enhanced agile software development solutions for IoT and ITS systems.

These command channels are a part of the SCADA system, which is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Maliciously injected commands can cause a wide range of issues including blackouts. However, the literature addressing this problem is limited. In order to fill this gap, a generalized framework is proposed to achieve simultaneous detection of attacks against various types of control devices/equipments used in transmission systems, even if they are carried out stealthily. First, generalized mathematical models of such stealthy attacks are presented. Then, based on these attack models, changes in the measurement covariance matrix that occur during an attack are exploited to formulate the proposed approach. We first mathematically characterize these changes using the eigenvectors and trace of the covariance matrix and then use them to develop a detection metric. It is observed that when the model of a false data injection (FDI) attack is considered, the developed detection metric is also capable of detecting such attacks. The algorithm that results from the detection metric is a generalized framework for detection of attacks against all types of transmission system controls and measurements. Moreover, the algorithm is non-iterative, computationally inexpensive, and independent of both the type of state estimation and communication technology used. The proposed algorithm is found to be effective, when tested on the IEEE 118-bus system. IEEE",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122071182

A secure and efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) is crucial to detect security threats. Existing IDSs are known to suffer from many problems, most notably the high rate of false positive alerts, the long time required to detect attacks, and the inability to detect zero-day attacks, which can ruin companies. The weakness of IDS backend engines costs companies time in the investigation process. This paper proposes and enhances IDS detection mechanisms via two processes: using a deep neural network (DNN) model with new features for threat detection based on two assumptions related to handling zero-day attacks, with low computing power and resources, and a comprehensive solution for detection by merging the DNN model and principle component analysis (PCA) to increase security and performance. The proposed detection mechanism combines DNN, PCA, statistical, and knowledge-based approaches to offer significantly greater efficiency than existing IDS, as indicated by analytical and software results. A simulation model is used with up-to-date web attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS), denial of service (DoS), brute force, insider infiltration, Botnet, and Heartbleed attacks. The proposed detection techniques for large networks are analyzed and complexity in the design is avoided by reducing the number of DNN model layers, thus minimizing detection time delay and false positives, while increasing security against network attacks. Integrating the proposed DNN with PCA, an innovative contribution, introduces robust IDS to significantly improve the detection time delay and security performance. The proposed model showed a 98% accuracy rate. To best of our knowledge, the highest accuracy rate stated based on a large number of attacks is 97%, which makes our model state of art. © 2021",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121980047

As businesses virtually eliminated in-person experiences, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way we live and caused a mass migration to digital platforms. However, this shift also made people more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Victims are being targeted by attackers for their credentials or financial rewards, or both. This is because the Internet itself is inherently difficult to secure, and the attackers can code in a way that exploits its flaws. Once the attackers gain root access to the devices, they have complete control and can do whatever they want. Consequently, taking advantage of highly unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 event, cybercriminals launched massive phishing, malware, identity theft, and ransomware attacks. Therefore, if we wish to save people from these frauds in times when millions have already been tipped into poverty and the rest are trying hard to sustain, it is imperative to curb these attacks and attackers.

Since actual network logs are imbalanced data that contain fewer malicious logs than benign logs, many studies have evaluated the classification performance of malicious log detection by using the area under the curve (AUC). However, in actual operation, a low false positive rate (FPR) is required to reduce the burden on network operators. Therefore, the area to be focused on is not the entire AUC but the partial AUC (pAUC) in a specific low FPR interval. We propose a novel supervised learning method that maximizes the pAUC, called Partial AUC Utilization for Malicious log Analysis (PUMA). Once the FPR that operators can permit is specified, PUMA optimizes the detection model to obtain the best TPR for the specified FPR interval. In addition, we describe the theoretical formulation and algorithm of PUMA to handle ties in the scores of training data that frequently occur in log analysis and often make existing pAUC maximization methods unsuitable. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PUMA after comparing it with conventional methods with proxy logs from a real-world large enterprise network. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121930352

In this paper, we present a novel perspective on this problem through the development of an intelligent system that generates reports from large email datasets in the form of short stories. The stories generated by the system are based on identifiable plot structures in popular media. These structures are used as semantic sensemaking templates to organize data for further filtering and triage. The end-to-end system, accessible through an interactive dashboard, incorporates unsupervised annotation modules (such as speech acts and sentiment), topic discovery, communication network analysis, character personality profiles, and automated text and visualization generators.

Though there are numerous types of malicious JavaScript that are difficult to detect, generalizing the malicious script’s signature can help catch more complex JavaScripts that use obfuscation techniques. This paper aims at detecting malicious JavaScripts based on structure and attribute analysis of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) that capture the generalized semantic meaning of the source code. We apply a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to process the AST features and get a graph representation via neural message passing with neighborhood aggregation. The attention layer enriches our method to track pertinent parts of scripts that may contain the signature of malicious intent.

The heart of NESG is strategy evaluation neural network (SENN). SENN is able to effectively evaluate leader’s strategies against an opponent who may potentially not behave in a perfectly rational way due to certain cognitive biases or limitations. SENN is trained on historical data and does not require any direct prior knowledge regarding the follower’s target preferences, payoff distribution or bounded rationality model. NESG was tested on a set of 90 benchmark games inspired by real-world cybersecurity scenario known as deep packet inspections. Experimental results show an advantage of applying NESG over the existing state-of-the-art methods when playing against not perfectly rational opponents. The method provides high quality solutions with superior computation time scalability. Due to generic and knowledge-free construction of NESG, the method may be applied to various real-life security scenarios. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121913143

This has brought an increase in the rate of cybersecurity issues over the years and a prominent one is the phishing attack where malicious websites mimic the appearance and functionalities of another legitimate website to collect users’ credentials required for access to services. Several measures have been proposed to mitigate this attack; blacklisting and variants of machine learning approaches have been employed, yielding good performance results. However, there is a need to increase the rate of identification of phishing attacks and reduce the rate of false positives. This study proposes the use of a functional tree (FT) machine learning approach to mitigate phishing attacks. FT, a hybridization of multivariate decision trees and discriminant function using constructive induction, uses logistic regression for splitting tree nodes and leaf prediction, unlike the conventional decision tree that simply split nodes based on the data. Furthermore, a variant of the FT is proposed based on cascade generalization (CG-FT). Three datasets with varied instance distributions, both balanced and imbalanced, are used in the empirical investigation of the performance of the proposed CG-FT. The results showed that FT has improved performances over some selected baseline classifiers. Relative to FT, the CG-FT techniques showed improvement in the detection of a phishing attack with Area Under the Curve (AUC) and True Positive rate (TP-rate) ranging from 98–99.6% and 92–97% respectively in the datasets. Also, the false-positive rate is reduced with values ranging from 1.7 to 6.1%. The proposed CG-FT showed improvement over all the other reviewed approaches based on studied performance metrics. The use of FT and its hybridization with cascade generalization (CG-FT) showed an improvement in performance in the mitigation of phishing attacks. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121900102

The concept of playable cities has been advanced to create smart cities that are more human-centered. As smart cities are socio-technical structures involving technologies, people, and policies that each impact privacy and security, such an approach also has potential to develop stronger cybersecurity protocols for smart cities going beyond technological approaches. In this article, we conduct a systematic literature review of articles from 2015 to 2020 that discuss smart/playable cities and data gathering in relation to privacy and security. Based on this systematic review, we found a disconnect exists between smart and playable cities literature in terms of exclusive focus on technological solutions for security and little focus on people and policies as part of cybersecurity in the literature analyzed. Seeing as playable cities embrace user-generated co-creation, we argue that this personal side is important to get people to participate meaningfully in smart cities that lets them embrace cybersecurity policies as part of personal behavior. For this purpose, we propose utilizing a cybersecurity lens (e.g., McCumber cube model) so that smart city designers can more fully develop and consider cybersecurity that includes both personal privacy and playable approaches. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121866864

In practice, cyber attackers often exploit vulnerabilities in the system or web applications to implant a backdoor to a web server. To address this challenge, static feature detection is believed to be an effective solution. However, it may also leave a potential security “hole” that could be exploited by intruders. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called TridentShell, which can inject a webshell into the memory of web application server without leaving attack traces. Our attack is able to bypass almost all types of static detection methods. In particular, it attempts to blend itself into the web server and erase attack traces automatically, instead of encrypting or obfuscating the content of webshell to avoid detection. Besides, TridentShell can still be executed even when the webmasters restrict the access to web directory. In the evaluation, we showcase how TridentShell can successfully inject a webshell into five different types of Java application servers (covering around 87% Java application servers in the market), and can remove the attack traces on the server (increasing the detection difficulty). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121858506

Domain name protocol attacks are one of the most pervasive network attacks posing a threat to networks, whereby attackers send harmful information to the network; this type of threat is identified as DNS tunneling. The DNS protocol has recently gained increased attention from cyber-attackers, targeting organizations with a web presence or reliance on e-commerce businesses. Cyber-attackers can subtly exploit the contents of encrypted DNS packets that are sent across covert network tunnels, which are difficult for firewalls and blacklist detection methods to detect. Therefore, efficient methods for detecting DNS intrusions in the network are required. Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and computational intelligence models have proved to be increasingly effective in dealing with these cyber-attacks, especially when using an appropriate dataset. This paper proposes an intrusion detection model to detect malicious DNS over HTTPS (DoH) queries among network covert tunnels, using statistical analysis and Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN) techniques, based on the flow level of the network traffic. The proposed approach was tested and evaluated based on a realistic dataset called CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020, provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. Experiments have shown that the robustness of the model is strong, with a detection rate of 100%. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved high performance in terms of the accuracy rate in detecting malicious DoH queries, with low false-negative and false-positive rates. Furthermore, the number of features used is fewer than other approaches, making it perform faster in the training and testing phases. © 2021 University of Kerbala.

As a result of these improvements, numerous new channels of communication are being created, one of which is the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT has recently emerged as cutting-edge technology for creating smart environments. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a subset of the IoT, in which medical equipment exchange information with each other to exchange sensitive information. These developments enable the healthcare business to maintain a higher level of touch and care for its patients. Security is seen as a significant challenge in whatsoever technology's reliance based on the IoT. Security difficulties occur owing to the various potential attacks posed by attackers. There are numerous security concerns, such as remote hijacking, impersonation, denial of service attacks, password guessing, and man-in-the-middle. In the event of such attacks, critical data associated with IoT connectivity may be revealed, altered, or even rendered inaccessible to authorized users. As a result, it turns out to be critical to safeguard the IoT/IoMT ecosystem against malware assaults. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate how a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and supervised machine learning models (random forest, decision tree, KNN, and ridge classifier) can be utilized to develop an efficient and effective IDS in the IoMT environment for classifying and forecasting unexpected cyber threats. Preprocessing and normalization of network data are performed. Following that, we optimized features using a bio-inspired particle swarm algorithm.

Ensuring the security of in-vehicle communication data is the basis for the safety of cooperative transportation systems. An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).

It guarantees system adequacy and reliability by reducing the gap between supply and demand, and it bolsters cybersecurity by enabling false data detection and system security by predicting system peak load. This article aims to build an accurate long-term load forecasting model based on deep learning (DL) algorithms. Initially, big-data analytics and feature engineering are applied to the power load and weather historical data. Next, three different load forecasting models are developed based on three corresponding deep neural network models (DNN): the simple RNN, the long short term memory (LSTM), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU), respectively. To find an accurate DNN model, a two-step hyperparameter optimization is performed consisting of cross-validation. In the first step, the random search (RS) algorithm is employed to narrow the parameter search space to a smaller local one. In the second step, the grid search (GS) algorithm is used to find the best hyperparameters in the local area located by RS. However, the computational burden of the DNN training process is too high and may lead to out-of-memory (OOM) issues, especially when we are dealing with a big volume of data. To overcome this problem, we developed our Python program based on Tensorflow framework and implemented the framework on a high-performance computer cluster (HPCC). Then, different jobs are defined to employ parallel distributed computing (PDC) capability on the SIU BigDawg HPCC. To this end, all DNN hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, neurons, dropout, batch size, epoch, learning rate, etc.) can be optimized and result in a comprehensive and accurate load forecasting model. Our proposed method, along with the programming framework, is evaluated on a real-world dataset. Among the three models developed and tested, the GRU, with load and weather as features, has demonstrated excellent performance and outperformed the other two models for long-term forecasting with the best metrics (i.e., MSE, MAPE, <formula><tex>$R^2$</tex></formula>) and daily error almost less than 1&#x0025;. Also, our best model (optimized GRU) is compared with the other reported state-of-the-art models such as DBN, SVR, RM-LSTM, DM-GCNN, TCMS-CNN. It is demonstrated that the proposed framework yields a superior performance than the others. IEEE",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121809739

From the SLR, it is evident that AI has several opportunities for the sector. There are many fin-tech start-ups that offer banking AI solutions, and banking regulators are fostering AI adoption through legislation and collaboration. Other opportunities include the following: personalized services, smart wallets, decision-making and problem-solving, customer satisfaction and loyalty, process automation (especially targeting repetitive tasks), transactional security and cybersecurity improvements, and promotion of digital financial inclusion. Nevertheless, the key banking industry stakeholders have to formulate appropriate strategies aimed at overcoming existing and prospect AI challenges. Among the AI challenges that should be prioritized we include the following: job loss and user acceptance concerns, privacy breaches, creativity and adaptability loss, restrictive implementation and operational requirements, digital divide, availability of vast quality data, AI-business strategy alignment, and loss of emotional “human touch”. However, existing studies are largely descriptive and based on secondary sources of data.

A direct consequence of the highly interconnected architecture of ICSs is the introduced cyber vulnerability and increasing cyber security threats to ICSs. Numerous researches pay attention to the security problem of ICSs. However, most current researches face two challenges. First, the interaction problem between cyber layer and physical layer of ICSs may result incorrect attack response strategies. Second, ICSs are real-time systems, but existing defense decision algorithms based on game theory or reinforcement learning techniques have high computational complexity, which prevents it from making decisions quickly. In this paper, we design a new multi-attribute based reward quantitative method and propose a multi-attribute based Q-learning algorithm to resolve the interaction problem. In addition, to overcome the limitation of slow convergence, we develop an effective parallel Q-learning (PQL) algorithm to quickly find the optimal strategy. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the PQL algorithm.

One of the main security issues in WSNs is the security of routing protocols. A typical WSN consists of a large number of small size, low-power, low-cost sensor devices. These devices are very resource-constrained and usually use cheap short-range radios to communicate with each other in an ad hoc fashion thus, achieving security in these networks is a big challenge, which is open for research. Design/methodology/approach: The route updates and data messages of the protocol are authenticated using Edwards-curves Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA). Routing protocols play an essential role in WSNs, they ensure the delivery of the sensed data from the remote sensor nodes to back-end systems via a data sink. Routing protocols depend on route updates received from neighboring nodes to determine the best path to the sink. Manipulating these updates by inserting rouge nodes in the network that advertise false updates can lead to a catastrophic impact on the compromised WSN performance. Findings: As a result, a new secure energy-aware routing protocol (SEARP) is proposed, which uses security enhanced clustering algorithm and EdDSA to authenticate route advertisements and messages. A secure clustering algorithm is also used as part of the proposed protocol to conserve energy, prolong network lifetime and counteract wormhole attacks. Originality/value: In this paper, a SEARP is proposed to address network layer security attacks in WSNs. A secure clustering algorithm is also used as part of the proposed protocol to conserve energy, prolong network lifetime and counteract wormhole attacks. A simulation has been carried out using Sensoria Simulator and the performance evaluation has been discussed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121776283

It is therefore urgently necessary to enhance vehicle security by detecting and stopping cyber-attacks.

Moreover, when compared to four state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems, it is the only solution that is capable of discarding attacking frames before damage occurs while being deployed on inexpensive Raspberry Pi.

However, due to the complex semantic relationships among concepts, no SM is ensured to be effective in all alignment tasks. The aggregation of SMs so that their advantages and disadvantages complement each other directly affects the quality of alignments. In this work, we formally define this problem, discuss its challenges, and present a problem-specific genetic algorithm (GA) to effectively address it.

The control plane of SDN can be extended to many underlying networks such as fog to Internet of Things (IoT). The fog-to-IoT is currently a promising architecture to manage a real-time large amount of data. However, most of the fog-to-IoT devices are resource-constrained and devices are widespread that can be potentially targeted with cyber-attacks. The evolving cyber-attacks are still an arresting challenge in the fog-to-IoT environment such as Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Infiltration, malware, and botnets attacks. They can target varied fog-to-IoT agents and the whole network of organizations. The authors propose a deep learning (DL) driven SDN-enabled architecture for sophisticated cyber-attacks detection in fog-to-IoT environment to identify new attacks targeting IoT devices as well as other threats. The extensive simulations have been carried out using various DL algorithms and current state-of-the-art Coburg Intrusion Detection Data Set (CIDDS-001) flow-based dataset. For better analysis five DL models are compared including constructed hybrid DL models to distinguish the DL model with the best performance. The results show that proposed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hybrid model outperforms other DL models in terms of detection accuracy and response time. To show unbiased results 10-fold cross-validation is performed. The proposed framework is so effective that it can detect several types of cyber-attacks with 99.92% accuracy rate in multiclass classification. © 2021 Ihtisham Ullah et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121593047

We formulate the energy efficient management problem as a modified Markov decision problem (MMDP), and proposed an algorithm to seek a retransmission power schedule that achieves optimal tradeoff between energy consumption and communication rate for given channel noise power. In the case of unknown channel state, we design a statistical learning method to estimate channel noise power. Besides, inspired by the hypothesis testing, we design an anomaly detector to guarantee the instantaneity of channel noise power estimation and efficiency of energy management.

Efforts driven to build cybersecurity awareness to community is as important as strengthening the public sectors’ (government) capacity in dealing with cybersecurity threats. Public sectors’ capacity to use electronic systems should move in parallel with the awareness and ability to protect these. In most organizations, if not all, the topic of cybersecurity awareness is the initial touch point to educate employees on various fields. Learning from a cybersecurity awareness training can only be effective if done in a safe environment where repetitive failure is seen as input for learning optimization. A simulated environment for practice can facilitate the transfer of learned theories to practice. Reinforcing the learning content with innovative learning experience and digital technologies like (serious) games can make learning more effective and engaging. This study provides a survey of online serious games used in cybersecurity awareness and analysis of the motivational core drives used in the game mapped through the Octalysis framework. While the Octalysis gamification framework is widely used in the design of serious games, it is still rarely implemented to tackle cybersecurity challenges. This paper demonstrates the connection of cybersecurity awareness trainings to motivational factors and the help of a systematic approach, such as Octalysis framework, in comparing the various aspects of different awareness programmes. The paper also presents results from the key informant interviews from experts and implementors of cybersecurity awareness programmes, and serious games on key consideration to integrate the cybersecurity awareness initiatives and game-based learning to improve learning outcomes. The study gathers user journey experience from public sector to sustain their learning experience. Finally, the study presents a users’ experience design which can optimize learning and sustain learning experience in cybersecurity awareness with game-based approach. © the authors, 2021.

One such technology is an email boundary control (or guard). However, even with mature tools there is a gap between availability and adoption, that this paper proposes is due to the management challenges in application, rather than technology.

As organisations continue with their digital transformations, they need to implement pervasive cyber defense measures to comply with the corresponding severe security threats. The number of organisations and individuals falling victim to targeted attacks such as spear-phishing attacks is growing rapidly. Regardless of substantial exploration in mitigation systems, attackers today are becoming more sophisticated as they cultivate their techniques, employing advanced natural language (NL) capabilities to deceive email security systems. Game theory approaches based on cybersecurity are mostly concentrated on proposing defence algorithms against attacks. This work is comprehensively centred on the role of the attacker in spear-phishing attacks, using OpenAI text generating model Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) to generate emails with various malicious content. Attackers use those emails to attack a target and attempt to deceive the defence system. Considering the lack of theoretic analysis from the attacker's perspective, a non-cooperative zero-sum spear-phishing game model is proposed that allows an attacker to choose an optimal strategy for maximising payoff. Moreover, we calculated the Nash equilibrium (NE) in mixed strategies for the attacker-defender game and provided a reasonable scheme for an attacker to gain an advantage over the target. © 2021 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

In an exploratory qualitative study, utilising thematic analysis, the intention is to take an interpretivist position to examine participants' accounts of working from home during a pandemic, by looking through the psychological contract (Rousseau, 1996a) lens to better understand this phenomenon. This research serves to offer a potential line of enquiry when it comes to the human factors of cyber and information security behaviour and any themes which may overlap with psychological contract breaches (PCB). Previous research has suggested that the psychological contract can impact on employee commitment towards their organisations (Jabeen, Behery and Hossam, 2015), and employees' attitudes towards cyber security affect the frequency in engaging in risky online behaviours, (Hadlington, 2018), this study aims to draw out any themes around these areas through semi-structured interviews with employees in a global law firm. © 2021 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

It is crucial to secure medical digital twins through deep understanding of the design of digital twins and applying the new vulnerability tolerant approach. In this paper, we present a new medical digital twin, which systematically combines Haptic-AR navigation and deep learning techniques to achieve virtual replica and cyber–human interaction. We report an innovative study of the cyber–human interaction performance in different scenarios. With the focus on cyber resilience, a new solution of vulnerability tolerant is the must in the real-world MDT scenarios. We propose a novel scheme for recognising and fixing MDT vulnerabilities, in which a new CodeBERT-based neural network is applied to better understand risky code and capture cybersecurity semantics. We develop a prototype of the new MDT and collect several real-world datasets. In the empirical study, a number of well-designed experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of digital twin, cyber–human interaction and vulnerability detection.

Load-altering cyberattacks launched via the manipulations of high-wattage appliances and assets are particularly alarming, as they are not continuously monitored by electric power utilities. Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) are among such high-wattage assets. Even EVCSs monitored by the electric power utilities and protected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such cyberattacks cause financial losses to the EVCSs. In this paper, we propose cyber insurance for EVCSs to hedge the economic loss due to such cyberattacks and develop a data-driven cyber insurance design model for public EVCSs. Under mild modeling assumptions, we derive an optimal cyber insurance premium. Then, we ensure the robustness of this optimal premium and investigate the risk of insuring the EVCSs using a suitable risk assessment metric (Conditional Value-at-Risk). A case study with data from EVCSs in Manhattan, New York illustrates our results. Our results demonstrate that risk assessment is crucial for designing insurance premiums. Furthermore, the premium increases in proportion to the loss coverage offered for the EVCSs. This work informs the stakeholders involved in the roll-out and operation of public EVCSs about the benefits of cyber insurance and suggests that insurance premiums can be reduced by deploying state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.

Load altering attack (LAA) is an important category of cyberattacks on the modern power systems, in which the attackers may damage the grid by viciously altering the remotely controllable loads (RCL) that are not properly protected. In order to mitigate the impacts of LAAs on the distribution systems, the promising soft open point (SOP) technology is deployed in this study. A two-stage optimization framework is proposed for the optimal installation and operation of SOPs for defending the distribution systems against LAAs. A chance-constrained optimization model is developed to guarantee the confidence level of the proposed two-stage model of SOPs in mitigating the impacts of LAAs. Further, a Wasserstein metric based distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) optimization method is developed to ensure the robustness of the proposed model against the ambiguity of the empirical probability distribution in practice. Case studies were performed on a 69-bus test system to validate the proposed method. The results of case studies show that the proposed framework is able to mitigate the impacts of LAAs on distribution systems with the installation of SOPs.

Numerous safety mishaps and security attacks in such systems have demonstrated the need to ensure their safety and security from early design stages. Research on CPS has mostly focused on securing existing, implemented industrial systems, while safety and security consideration during the design stages of modern industrial infrastructures has largely gone unnoticed. In this paper, we present a framework that extends previous, preliminary work on the integration of security in industrial engineering design practices, and provide an algorithmic approach that effectively reduces risk during industrial system design lifecycles. We achieve this by analyzing flows of materials and information related to physical processes using three steps: (1) Identifying critical components and flows, (2) prioritizing flows based on their ties to high risk and importance in terms of dependencies, and (3) classifying system components based on their influence on the overall industrial system. To do that, we utilize (i) material flow networks (MFN) for modelling/designing the physical system (ii) dependency risk graphs for analyzing networks dependencies and assessing the system, in terms of risk, (iii) graph minimum spanning trees, and (iv) network centrality metrics. To evaluate our approach, we model and assess the production chain corresponding to an oil refinery plant’s Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) purification process.

The benefits of this paradigm are obvious, but these IoT environments have brought with them new challenges, such as detecting and combating cybersecurity attacks against cyber-physical systems. This paper addresses the real-time detection of security attacks in these IoT systems through the combined used of Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Complex Event Processing (CEP). In this regard, in the past we proposed an intelligent architecture that integrates ML with CEP, and which permits the definition of event patterns for the real-time detection of not only specific IoT security attacks, but also novel attacks that have not previously been defined. Our current concern, and the main objective of this paper, is to ensure that the architecture is not necessarily linked to specific vendor technologies and that it can be implemented with other vendor technologies while maintaining its correct functionality. We also set out to evaluate and compare the performance and benefits of alternative implementations. This is why the proposed architecture has been implemented by using technologies from different vendors: firstly, the Mule Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) together with the Esper CEP engine; and secondly, the WSO2 ESB with the Siddhi CEP engine. Both implementations have been tested in terms of performance and stress, and they are compared and discussed in this paper. The results obtained demonstrate that both implementations are suitable and effective, but also that there are notable differences between them: the Mule-based architecture is faster when the architecture makes use of two message broker topics and compares different types of events, while the WSO2-based one is faster when there is a single topic and one event type, and the system has a heavy workload. © 2021.

These methods also play a vital role in combating financial crime, fraud, and cyberattacks. Financial crime is increasingly being committed over cyberspace, and cybercriminals are using a combination of hacking and social engineering techniques which are bypassing current financial and corporate institution security. With this comes a new umbrella term to capture the evolving landscape which is financial cybercrime. It is a combination of financial crime, hacking, and social engineering committed over cyberspace for the sole purpose of illegal economic gain. Identifying financial cybercrime-related activities is a hard problem, for example, a highly restrictive algorithm may block all suspicious activity obstructing genuine customer business. Navigating and identifying legitimate illicit transactions is not the only issue faced by financial institutions, there is a growing demand of transparency, fairness, and privacy from customers and regulators, which imposes unique constraints on the application of artificial intelligence methods to detect fraud-related activities. Traditionally, rule based systems and shallow anomaly detection methods have been applied to detect financial crime and fraud, but recent developments have seen graph based techniques and neural network models being used to tackle financial cybercrime. There is still a lack of a holistic understanding of the financial cybercrime ecosystem, relevant methods, and their drawbacks and new emerging open problems in this domain in spite of their popularity. In this survey, we aim to bridge the gap by studying the financial cybercrime ecosystem based on four axes: (a) different fraud methods adopted by criminals; (b) relevant systems, algorithms, drawbacks, constraints, and metrics used to combat each fraud type; (c) the relevant personas and stakeholders involved; (d) open and emerging problems in the financial cybercrime domain. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Detecting these threat actions in early phases before the final stage of the attacks can be executed against industrial endpoints can help prevent adversaries from achieving their goals. Threat hunting in IT networks has been previously studied, and several hunting methods have been proposed. However, these methods are not sufficient for ICSs, as the integration of industrial legacy systems with advanced IT networks has introduced new types of vulnerabilities and changed the behaviour of attacks. The lack of a unified hunting solution for integrated IT and OT networks is the gap that is considered in our paper. The contribution of this paper is an ICS Threat Hunting Framework (ICS-THF) which focuses on detecting cyber threats against ICS devices in the earliest phases of the attack lifecycle. ICS-THF consists of three stages, threat hunting triggers, threat hunting, and cyber threat intelligence. The threat hunting trigger stage identifies events or external resources that can trigger the hunting stage. The hunting stage uses a combination of the MITRE ATTCK Matrix and a Diamond model of intrusion analysis to generate a hunting hypothesis and to predict the future behaviour of the adversary. This hypothesis will be validated by analysing Diamond models of threat actions. Finally, the cyber threat intelligence stage is responsible for generating Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to be used for future threat hunting. The Black Energy 3 malware, PLC-Blaster malware, and SWaT dataset are used in this paper to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed framework. © 2021 IEEE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121351113

Yet, as OT systems progressively become more and more interconnected, they silently have turned into alluring targets for diverse groups of adversaries. Meanwhile, the inherent complexity of these systems, along with their advanced-in-age nature, prevents defenders from fully applying contemporary security controls in a timely manner. Forsooth, the combination of these hindering factors has led to some of the most severe cybersecurity incidents of the past years. This work contributes a full-fledged and up-to-date survey of the most prominent threats and attacks against Industrial Control Systems and critical infrastructures, along with the communication protocols and devices adopted in these environments. Our study highlights that threats against critical infrastructure follow an upward spiral due to the mushrooming of commodity tools and techniques that can facilitate either the early or late stages of attacks. Furthermore, our survey exposes that existing vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of several of the OT-specific network protocols and devices may easily grant adversaries the ability to decisively impact physical processes. We provide a categorization of such threats and the corresponding vulnerabilities based on various criteria. As far as we are aware, this is the first time an exhaustive and detailed survey of this kind is attempted. Author",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121348358

The widely used expert-based risk prioritization approach, e.g., Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), cannot realistically associate vulnerabilities to the likelihood of exploitation. The CVSS metrics are calculated from static formulas, and cannot easily integrate attackers&#x2019; motivations and capabilities w.r.t. the network environmental factors. To address this issue, this paper proposes LICALITY, a vulnerability risk prioritization system. LICALITY captures the attacker&#x2019;s preference on exploiting vulnerabilities through a threat modeling method, and learns threat attributes that contribute to the exploitation of vulnerability. LICALITY creatively uses a neuro-symbolic model, with neural network (NN) and probabilistic logic programming (PLP) techniques, to learn such threat attributes. The risk of vulnerability is assessed from the criticality of exploitation and the likelihood of exploitation. LICALITY consolidates these two measurements by using a logic reasoning engine. In the evaluation, the historical threat and future threat are from real attack scenarios. The results reveal that LICALITY reduces the vulnerability remediation work of the future threat required by the CVSS by a factor of 2.89 in the first case study and by a factor of 1.85 in the second case study. Such future threats are identified as the top routinely exploited vulnerabilities and the APT attack chained vulnerabilities reported in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) alerts.

An increasing number of grid operators is thus interested in the reduced equivalent representation of a large, interconnected power system to reduce the amount of required computational resources and data exchange, e.g., between grid operators. However, state-of-the-art grid equivalents become more and more inapplicable since they are analytically calculated for one specific grid state. They cannot properly be adapted to grid state changes and the behavior of the increasingly used controllers, such as reactive power controllers of DERs. Therefore, we propose an innovative grid equivalent based on artificial neural networks (ANN) which overcomes the drawbacks of the state-of-the-art grid equivalents as follows: 1) Using supervised ANNs with feedforward and recurrent architectures, power systems can be equivalently represented adaptively and thus more accurately. 2) A feature selection method identifies the elements in the grid with high sensitivity on the boundary enabling a reduction of grid data required for the ANN-based equivalent. 3) To guarantee data confidentiality and cybersecurity, an additional unsupervised ANN, an Autoencoder, is used for obfuscation of the data which is required for the proposed grid equivalent to be exchanged among grid operators, while the relevant information of the original data is preserved, maintaining the estimation accuracy. Our ANN-based approach is analyzed and evaluated with two German benchmark grids and representative scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ANN-based grid equivalent outperforms the state-of-the-art radial equivalent independent method.

Therefore, selecting the most appropriate nodes for protection to ensure system security is an essential issue in CPS. However, how to achieve this in the system design phase remains to be an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a security strategy determination method for CPS design models. In particular, we utilize SysML to model a CPS. To choose the best nodes for security protection, we realize an automatic construction of an attack-defense tree (ADTree) model from the SysML model by considering the known attacks and defenses. Further, we transform the ADTree model into an atom attack-defense tree (A2DTree) model and infer the optimal security strategy under a given cost constraint. We implement our method as an open-source tool and test it with a pump station attack. The experimental results show that the proposed method is reasonable and feasible and can provide theoretical guidance for the formulation of CPS security policies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Conference Paper,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121342053

The uncertainties and unplanned and unnatural events that are internal to supply chain networks and external to the environment of a firm pertaining to global supply chains are regarded as supply chain risks. The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the various emerging supply chain risks for strategy formulation in Industry 4.0 environment. Based on a systematic literature review and experts’ opinion, different supply chain risks in the present business environment have been analyzed. Major identified risks are operational and manufacturing process risk, behavioural risk, demand risk, governmental and organisational risk, system risk, financial risk, product recovery risk, social and environmental risk, supply risk, disruption risk, cyber security, and safety risk. For developing risk mitigation strategies, risk prioritization is very important. Sufficient research has not been done on ranking and categorization of these risks in the Industry 4.0 environment. Therefore, this study has tried to rank these emerging supply chain risks by the Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. These risks are further categorized as cause and effect using a Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). This classification of risks will facilitate top management of the organization in formulating strategies for risk mitigations in the Industry 4.0 environment. The findings of the study imply that supply chain managers should focus on disruption risk; cyber security and safety risk in the current Industry 4.0 environment. As supply chain risk management is an emerging research area in Industry 4.0 environment, the findings of this study will be very useful for industry professionals and researchers for further studies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121303697

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology adopted in this study was a systematic literature review aided by the use of SciMAT, a scientific mapping software. Documents were collected from the Web of Science and Scopus database from 2011 to 2020 using the words “Textile” and “Industry 4.0” that result in 865 documents and 115 were analyzed. Findings: The literature review showed that the textile industry in the international context is at an incipient stage of the implementation of Industry 4.0. The main aspects of Industry 4.0 that were identified in the textile industry initially focus on the implementation of technologies aimed at computerization and automation of processes, whose main focuses are increasing productivity and reducing costs. Projects for the implementation of augmented reality and 3D printing and simulation technologies in the textile industry, clothing and apparel area are still embryonic, normally implemented through tools and software oriented toward the creation and development of new models of processes, products and commerce. Research limitations/implications: The search in the databases was carried out on October 17, 2020. Therefore, for future study, other combinations of search terms and time update are suggested, in addition to including more databases besides Scopus and Web of Science. Practical implications: This literature review served as the basis for the development of a questionnaire that was applied to 72 people in an industry in the clothing sector, located in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Social implications: The benefits of industry 4.0 are perceived in people with its implementation, such as a reduction in energy consumption of around 15%, an increase of up to 25% in work efficiency, in addition to more assertive decision-making, improvement of processes and balance between life and work. Originality/value: Machine learning, artificial intelligence, smart fabrics, IoT, supply chain management, environmental protection, Big Data, autonomation and cyber physics were the strongest terms found, consolidating as a prominent field for current and future studies. From emerging and/or still unexplored areas of Industry 4.0 in the textile sector, there is real-time communication, computer applications, carbon, fibers, health care and sustainable development. Some strategic actions that are taking place in some countries are summarized and in Brazil the adoption rate is 29% for this sector, revealing itself as a needy area and suitable for the development of studies that address the subject. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121287164

Existing policy guidance is too abstract to address cybersecurity threats in a tangible manner. Conversely, extremely specific and technical lists of security controls for space systems without traceability to mission needs, nor alternative defensive solutions, stifles efforts to ensure controls are being implemented effectively and commensurate with the threats space systems face. This paper assists space system designers and operators to tailor cybersecurity guidance to their specific systems. In this paper, existing cybersecurity guidance that has been vetted for other industries is highlighted and applied to the space vehicle domain, where applicable. Identification of gaps in existing guidance where space vehicle-specific concepts are necessary is also addressed. A streamlined decision tree process to guide space system developers and operators through security considerations to address cybersecurity in a holistic manner is proposed. Sample mission-specific security guidance and recommendations are proposed to demonstrate the use of the decision tree. As threats evolve and cyber capabilities change over time, the specific guidance identified in the example may require modification; yet the decision process proposed should remain intact. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Practical examples demonstrated how to get an attack vector on the infrastructure using the classical testing theory on the example of Web-Applications and Modbus serial communication protocol. The OWASP Web-Application Security Testing Guide was used as a guideline. It was proposed to deliberately limit the space of the attack vector on the infrastructure by the Descartes basis of information leaks and digital footprints. Separate Google Dorks have been developed for each manufacturer of embedded systems for APCS and SCADA. Penetration testing was performed as an example of APCS and SCADA on port 502 of the modbus protocol using Nmap. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121210182

As the SDN gains popularity in practice, it attracts more attention from the attackers. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a determining component of a cybersecurity system in dealing with outsider threats. Fortunately, the centralization of the SDN makes the training of a machine learning-based IDS easier. On the other hand, there are not many yet research studies that address the intrusion detection problem, particularly to the SDN. The majority of published literature considers the intrusion detection problem of SDN similar to a general computer system. Many of them rely on the intrusion datasets that are generated for a normal computer system. In this paper, we study the problem of intrusion detection for the SDN using the latest public dataset. We present novel evaluation scenarios that have not been studied in the literature. We showed that our chosen algorithm can perform very well in some particular settings, such as classifying a single attack type or classifying multiple attack types coming from the same data source with the training dataset.

Methodologically sophisticated research forms an essential basis for understanding the challenges and opportunities for the richer descriptions of the behavior of cybersecurity practitioners (i.e., what they are doing and why they are doing it). This requires a broad and self-reflective approach to understand the use of a technique in socio-technical research within cybersecurity economics. Such understanding recognizes that research in this field involves more than just applying a method to create knowledge and diffuse it throughout society, organizations, and governments. This paper argues in favor of a multi-paradigmatic approach to cybersecurity economics research. Rather than adopting a single paradigm, this study suggests that results will be more prosperous and reliable if different methods from different existing paradigms are combined. Hence, it puts forward the desirability and feasibility of the multi-paradigmatic approach in cybersecurity economics research. It also outlines several practical guidelines that help design multi-paradigmatic research studies.

Regulation includes further raising standards for personal data protection and consumer rights, control over digital platforms, laying down a legal framework for the development of cutting-edge technologies, attracting investments, and allocating the EU’s own resources to potentially occupy niches in international markets in the future, all of which will strengthen the EU’s claim to leadership in regulating the digital economy and ensure its digital sovereignty.

However, prior studies have found inconsistent findings regarding the relationships within PMT. To shed light on these inconsistent findings, we introduce the attitudinal ambivalence theory to open the black box within PMT. We tested our model on data collect ed from 1,383 individuals facing potential cyberattacks of their emails in a field experiment. The results of polynomial regression with response surface analysis showed that attitudinal ambivalence is generated from the opposition between an individual’s evaluations of maladaptive rewards and social norms (i.e., descriptive norm and subjective norm). This attitudinal ambivalence, in turn, affects individuals’ evaluations of their coping appraisal process and protection motivation, and ultimately protection behavior. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of identifying the determinants and outcomes of attitudinal ambivalence in the information security context. From a theoretical standpoint, our work contributes to the information security literature by incorporating attitudinal ambivalence, which arises from the intrapersonal and interpersonal appraisal processes, into PMT. From a practical standpoint, our work provides insights into designing effective fear appeals to avoid triggering attitudinal ambivalence and thus encouraging adoption of security protection behavior. © 2021 The Author(s).

To counteract such security threats, it is crucial to detect malware accurately and early enough. The recent advances in machine learning technology have brought increasing interest in malware detection. A number of research studies have been conducted in the field. It is well known that malware detection accuracy largely depends on the training dataset used. Creating a suitable training dataset for efficient malware detection is thus crucial. Different works usually use their own dataset; therefore, a dataset is only effective for one detection method, and strictly comparing several methods using a common training dataset is difficult. In this paper, we focus on how to create a training dataset for efficiently detecting malware. To achieve our goal, the first step is to clarify the information that can accurately characterize malware. This paper concentrates on threads, by treating them as important information for characterizing malware. Specifically, on the basis of the dynamic analysis log from the Alkanet, a system call tracer, we obtain the thread information and classify the thread information processing into four patterns. Then the malware detection is performed using the number of transitions of system calls appearing in the thread as a feature. Our comparative experimental results showed that the primary thread information is important and useful for detecting malware with high accuracy.

In this paper, background on the use of AM in the military supply chain will be presented, followed by a presentation of the issue of cybersecurity in AM. The use of systems engineering for cybersecure AM will be described followed by a presentation of an “Intelligent Manufacturing Platform” as a solution for use in AM in the US Army supply chain. The implications and recommendations for future research and the practical application of systems engineering for cybersecure AM will be discussed followed by a conclusion. © 2021 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2021.

In particular, DNNs can be designed to have backdoors that allow an adversary to easily and reliably fool an image classifier by adding a pattern of pixels called a trigger. It is generally difficult to detect backdoors, and existing detection methods are computationally expensive and require extensive resources (e.g., access to the training data). Here, we propose a rapid feature-generation technique that quantifies the robustness of a DNN, ‘fingerprints’ its nonlinearity, and allows us to detect backdoors (if present). Our approach involves studying how a DNN responds to noise-infused images with varying noise intensity, which we summarize with titration curves. We find that DNNs with backdoors are more sensitive to input noise and respond in a characteristic way that reveals the backdoor and where it leads (its ‘target’). Our empirical results demonstrate that we can accurately detect backdoors with high confidence orders-of-magnitude faster than existing approaches (seconds versus hours). © 2021 by SIAM.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120944070

This quantitative research, supported by the socio-technical perspective, explores the employee perceptions of cyber-security onboard cruise ships. The results show that the cruise industry has made an attempt to increase its cyber-security by introducing a formal policy and training their employees. Employees, as a consequence, perceive cyber-security to be important. However, employee perceptions are not reflective of their behaviours onboard. This is because there are various technical and organizational obstacles to their cyber-security practices which have been overlooked. As a result, the cruise industry could do more to prioritise cyber-security on a day-to-day level in order to make sure that the employee experience is in alignment with cyber-security policies. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120941430

The complex linkage between society and technology is become ever more critical as the world continues to shift more day-to-day life online, and this notion has increased greatly during the coronavirus global pandemic where online platforms have become an essential aspect for communicating. The spread of online terrorist propaganda has sparked concerns about the governance of Internet. However, Internet governance is multifaceted, complex and can be examined through various lenses. This paper argues that there is a need for a socio-technical perspective, exploring the inextricable linkages between societies and technology, on Internet governance. Focusing on the UK’s approach to governing terrorist propaganda, the paper highlights the strengths and limitations of the model of national law and regulation. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120938331
