1641462606-92,https://www.schneier.com/page/53/,Global Surveillance in the Wake of COVID-19,"The most common form of surveillance implemented to battle the pandemic is the use of smartphone location data, which can track population-level movement down to enforcing individual quarantines. Some governments are making apps that offer coronavirus health information, while also sharing location information with authorities for a period of time. For instance, in early March, the Iranian government released an app that it pitched as a self-diagnostic tool. While the tool’s efficacy was likely low, given reports of asymptomatic carriers of the virus, the app saved location data of millions of Iranians, according to a Vice report."

Ideally, affected companies should strongly encourage this behavior and have mechanisms in place to mitigate harm. In order to make recommendations to companies about how to help their users perform these and other security-enhancing actions after breaches, we must first have some understanding of the current effectiveness of companies’ post-breach practices. To study the effectiveness of password-related breach notifications and practices enforced after a breach, we examine­ — based on real-world password data from 249 participants­ — whether and how constructively participants changed their passwords after a breach announcement."

We quantify the scope of cryptocurrency pump and dump schemes on Discord and Telegram, two popular group-messaging platforms. We joined all relevant Telegram and Discord groups/channels and identified thousands of different pumps. Our findings provide the first measure of the scope of such pumps and empirically document important properties of this ecosystem."

You can then use these “cloaked” photos as you normally would, sharing them on social media, sending them to friends, printing them or displaying them on digital devices, the same way you would any other photo. The difference, however, is that if and when someone tries to use these photos to build a facial recognition model, “cloaked” images will teach the model an highly distorted version of what makes you look like you. The cloak effect is not easily detectable, and will not cause errors in model training. However, when someone tries to identify you using an unaltered image of you (e.g. a photo taken in public), and tries to identify you, they will fail."

1641462653-262,https://www.schneier.com/page/36/,Detecting Phishing Emails,"Abstract: Phishing scam emails are emails that pretend to be something they are not in order to get the recipient of the email to undertake some action they normally would not. While technical protections against phishing reduce the number of phishing emails received, they are not perfect and phishing remains one of the largest sources of security risk in technology and communication systems. To better understand the cognitive process that end users can use to identify phishing messages, I interviewed 21 IT experts about instances where they successfully identified emails as phishing in their own inboxes. IT experts naturally follow a three-stage process for identifying phishing emails. In the first stage, the email recipient tries to make sense of the email, and understand how it relates to other things in their life. As they do this, they notice discrepancies: little things that are “off” about the email. As the recipient notices more discrepancies, they feel a need for an alternative explanation for the email. At some point, some feature of the email — usually, the presence of a link requesting an action — triggers them to recognize that phishing is a possible alternative explanation. At this point, they become suspicious (stage two) and investigate the email by looking for technical details that can conclusively identify the email as phishing. Once they find such information, then they move to stage three and deal with the email by deleting it or reporting it. I discuss ways this process can fail, and implications for improving training of end users about phishing."

The other feature scans all iMessage images sent or received by child accounts — that is, accounts designated as owned by a minor — for sexually explicit material, and if the child is young enough, notifies the parent when these images are sent or received. This feature can be turned on or off by parents."
1641462622-154,https://www.schneier.com/page/47/,The Unintended Harms of Cybersecurity,"Abstract: Well-meaning cybersecurity risk owners will deploy countermeasures (technologies or procedures) to manage risks to their services or systems. In some cases, those countermeasures will produce unintended consequences, which must then be addressed. Unintended consequences can potentially induce harm, adversely affecting user behaviour, user inclusion, or the infrastructure itself (including other services or countermeasures). Here we propose a framework for preemptively identifying unintended harms of risk countermeasures in cybersecurity.The framework identifies a series of unintended harms which go beyond technology alone, to consider the cyberphysical and sociotechnical space: displacement, insecure norms, additional costs, misuse, misclassification, amplification, and disruption. We demonstrate our framework through application to the complex,multi-stakeholder challenges associated with the prevention of cyberbullying as an applied example. Our framework aims to illuminate harmful consequences, not to paralyze decision-making, but so that potential unintended harms can be more thoroughly considered in risk management strategies. The framework can support identification and preemptive planning to identify vulnerable populations and preemptively insulate them from harm. There are opportunities to use the framework in coordinating risk management strategy across stakeholders in complex cyberphysical environments."

These clicks are vital to the inference analysis: the time between them allows the SpiKey software to compute the key’s inter-ridge distances and what locksmiths call the “bitting depth” of those ridges: basically, how deeply they cut into the key shaft, or where they plateau out. If a key is inserted at a nonconstant speed, the analysis can be ruined, but the software can compensate for small speed variations."

This work replicates and extends the 2012 paper Why Johnny Can’t Browse in Peace: On the Uniqueness of Web Browsing History Patterns[48]. The original work demonstrated that browsing profiles are highly distinctive and stable. We reproduce those results and extend the original work to detail the privacy risk posed by the aggregation of browsing histories. Our dataset consists of two weeks of browsing data from ~52,000 Firefox users. Our work replicates the original paper’s core findings by identifying 48,919 distinct browsing profiles, of which 99% are unique. High uniqueness hold seven when histories are truncated to just 100 top sites. We then find that for users who visited 50 or more distinct domains in the two-week data collection period, ~50% can be reidentified using the top 10k sites. Reidentifiability rose to over 80% for users that browsed 150 or more distinct domains. Finally, we observe numerous third parties pervasive enough to gather web histories sufficient to leverage browsing history as an identifier."

Indeed, the popular tongue-in-cheek website http://thispersondoesnotexist.com, taunts users with GAN generated images that seem too real to believe. On the other hand, GANs do leak information about their training data, as evidenced by membership attacks recently demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we challenge the assumption that GAN faces really are novel creations, by constructing a successful membership attack of a new kind. Unlike previous works, our attack can accurately discern samples sharing the same identity as training samples without being the same samples. We demonstrate the interest of our attack across several popular face datasets and GAN training procedures. Notably, we show that even in the presence of significant dataset diversity, an over represented person can pose a privacy concern."

We optimize these faces, by using an evolutionary algorithm in the latent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator.

The results we present demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a high coverage of the population (over 40%) with less than 10 master faces, for three leading deep face recognition systems."

Most significantly, ransomware attackers have transitioned from a model in which they hit lots of individuals and accumulated many small ransom payments to one where they carefully plan attacks against a smaller group of large targets from which they can demand massive ransoms. The antivirus firm Emsisoft found that the average requested fee has increased from about $5,000 in 2018 to about $200,000 this year."

In this paper, we present a method that delivers malware covertly and detection-evadingly through neural network models. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware into the neurons, malware can be delivered covertly with minor or even no impact on the performance of neural networks. Meanwhile, since the structure of the neural network models remains unchanged, they can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded into a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicious are raised by antivirus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks becomes a forwarding trend of malware.

This has resulted in users becoming more privacy-cautious and browser vendors gradually adopting countermeasures to mitigate certain forms of cookie-based and cookie-less tracking. Nonetheless, the complexity and feature-rich nature of modern browsers often lead to the deployment of seemingly innocuous functionality that can be readily abused by adversaries. In this paper we introduce a novel tracking mechanism that misuses a simple yet ubiquitous browser feature: favicons. In more detail, a website can track users across browsing sessions by storing a tracking identifier as a set of entries in the browser’s dedicated favicon cache, where each entry corresponds to a specific subdomain. In subsequent user visits the website can reconstruct the identifier by observing which favicons are requested by the browser while the user is automatically and rapidly redirected through a series of subdomains. More importantly, the caching of favicons in modern browsers exhibits several unique characteristics that render this tracking vector particularly powerful, as it is persistent (not affected by users clearing their browser data), non-destructive (reconstructing the identifier in subsequent visits does not alter the existing combination of cached entries), and even crosses the isolation of the incognito mode. We experimentally evaluate several aspects of our attack, and present a series of optimization techniques that render our attack practical. We find that combining our favicon-based tracking technique with immutable browser-fingerprinting attributes that do not change over time allows a website to reconstruct a 32-bit tracking identifier in 2 seconds. Furthermore,our attack works in all major browsers that use a favicon cache, including Chrome and Safari. Due to the severity of our attack we propose changes to browsers’ favicon caching behavior that can prevent this form of tracking, and have disclosed our findings to browser vendors who are currently exploring appropriate mitigation strategies."

This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers. We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers. We began observing this latest campaign in May 2021 and have been notifying impacted partners and customers while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the reseller community. Since May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate, but to date we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been compromised. Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful."

In this paper, we ask, “What are the potential legal risks to adversarial ML researchers when they attack ML systems?” Studying or testing the security of any operational system potentially runs afoul the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the primary United States federal statute that creates liability for hacking. We claim that Adversarial ML research is likely no different. Our analysis show that because there is a split in how CFAA is interpreted, aspects of adversarial ML attacks, such as model inversion, membership inference, model stealing, reprogramming the ML system and poisoning attacks, may be sanctioned in some jurisdictions and not penalized in others. We conclude with an analysis predicting how the US Supreme Court may resolve some present inconsistencies in the CFAA’s application in Van Buren v. United States, an appeal expected to be decided in 2021. We argue that the court is likely to adopt a narrow construction of the CFAA, and that this will actually lead to better adversarial ML security outcomes in the long term."

The logs from the Duo authentication server further showed that no attempts had been made to log into the account in question. Volexity was able to confirm that session hijacking was not involved and, through a memory dump of the OWA server, could also confirm that the attacker had presented cookie tied to a Duo MFA session named duo-sid."

We explore not the failure to follow best practices, but rather a surprising lack of understanding, and void in the literature, on what (generically) “best practice” means, independent of meaningfully identifying specific individual practices. Confusion is evident from guidelines that conflate desired outcomes with security practices to achieve those outcomes. How do best practices, good practices, and standard practices differ? Or guidelines, recommendations, and requirements? Can something be a best practice if it is not actionable? We consider categories of best practices, and how they apply over the lifecycle of IoT devices. For concreteness in our discussion, we analyze and categorize a set of 1014 IoT security best practices, recommendations, and guidelines from industrial, government, and academic sources. As one example result, we find that about 70\% of these practices or guidelines relate to early IoT device lifecycle stages, highlighting the critical position of manufacturers in addressing the security issues in question. We hope that our work provides a basis for the community to build on in order to better understand best practices, identify and reach consensus on specific practices, and then find ways to motivate relevant stakeholders to follow them."

We quantified how a commercially and economically important squid (Doryteuthis pealeii: Lesueur 1821) responded to pile driving sounds recorded from a windfarm installation within this species’ habitat. Fifteen-minute portions of these sounds were played to 16 individual squid. A subset of animals (n = 11) received a second exposure after a 24-h rest period. Body pattern changes, inking, jetting, and startle responses were observed and nearly all squid exhibited at least one response. These responses occurred primarily during the first 8 impulses and diminished quickly, indicating potential rapid, short-term habituation. Similar response rates were seen 24-h later, suggesting squid re-sensitized to the noise. Increased tolerance of anti-predatory alarm responses may alter squids’ ability to deter and evade predators. Noise exposure may also disrupt normal intraspecific communication and ecologically relevant responses to sound."

Yet the United States saw unprecedented turnout over the last few weeks. Many states handled voting by mail and early voting impressively and huge numbers of volunteers turned up to work the polls. Large amounts of litigation before the election clarified the rules in every state. And for all the president’s griping about the counting of votes, it has been orderly and apparently without significant incident.

As users store more and more photos in the cloud, significant privacy concerns arise because even a single compromise of a user’s credentials give attackers unfettered access to all of the user’s photos. We have created Easy Secure Photos (ESP) to enable users to protect their photos on cloud photo services such as Google Photos. ESP introduces a new client-side encryption architecture that includes a novel format-preserving image encryption algorithm, an encrypted thumbnail display mechanism, and a usable key management system. ESP encrypts image data such that the result is still a standard format image like JPEG that is compatible with cloud photo services. ESP efficiently generates and displays encrypted thumbnails for fast and easy browsing of photo galleries from trusted user devices. ESP’s key management makes it simple to authorize multiple user devices to view encrypted image content via a process similar to device pairing, but using the cloud photo service as a QR code communication channel. We have implemented ESP in a popular Android photos app for use with Google Photos and demonstrate that it is easy to use and provides encryption functionality transparently to users, maintains good interactive performance and image quality while providing strong privacy guarantees, and retains the sharing and storage benefits of Google Photos without any changes to the cloud service"

This is particularly alarming from a security perspective, as humans have proven to be one of the weakest links when protecting critical infrastructure in general, and the power grid in particular. Here, we consider an attack in which an adversary attempts to manipulate the behavior of energy consumers by sending fake discount notifications encouraging them to shift their consumption into the peak-demand period. Using Greater London as a case study, we show that such disinformation can indeed lead to unwitting consumers synchronizing their energy-usage patterns, and result in blackouts on a city-scale if the grid is heavily loaded. We then conduct surveys to assess the propensity of people to follow-through on such notifications and forward them to their friends. This allows us to model how the disinformation may propagate through social networks, potentially amplifying the attack impact. These findings demonstrate that in an era when disinformation can be weaponized, system vulnerabilities arise not only from the hardware and software of critical infrastructure, but also from the behavior of the consumers."

OF leverages online finder devices to detect the presence of missing offline devices using Bluetooth and report an approximate location back to the owner via the Internet. While OF is not the first system of its kind, it is the first to commit to strong privacy goals. In particular, OF aims to ensure finder anonymity, untrackability of owner devices, and confidentiality of location reports. This paper presents the first comprehensive security and privacy analysis of OF. To this end, we recover the specifications of the closed-source OF protocols by means of reverse engineering. We experimentally show that unauthorized access to the location reports allows for accurate device tracking and retrieving a user’s top locations with an error in the order of 10 meters in urban areas. While we find that OF’s design achieves its privacy goals, we discover two distinct design and implementation flaws that can lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to the location history of the past seven days, which could deanonymize users. Apple has partially addressed the issues following our responsible disclosure. Finally, we make our research artifacts publicly available."

Unlike most of the shady apps found in Play Store malware, Kaspersky’s researchers say, PhantomLance’s hackers apparently smuggled in data-stealing apps with the aim of infecting only some hundreds of users; the spy campaign likely sent links to the malicious apps to those targets via phishing emails. “In this case, the attackers used Google Play as a trusted source,” says Kaspersky researcher Alexey Firsh. “You can deliver a link to this app, and the victim will trust it because it’s Google Play.”"

The Bluetooth standard includes a legacy authentication procedure and a secure authentication procedure, allowing devices to authenticate to each other using a long term key. Those procedures are used during pairing and secure connection establishment to prevent impersonation attacks. In this paper, we show that the Bluetooth specification contains vulnerabilities enabling to perform impersonation attacks during secure connection establishment. Such vulnerabilities include the lack of mandatory mutual authentication, overly permissive role switching, and an authentication procedure downgrade. We describe each vulnerability in detail, and we exploit them to design, implement, and evaluate master and slave impersonation attacks on both the legacy authentication procedure and the secure authentication procedure. We refer to our attacks as Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS (BIAS)."

1641462587-25,https://www.schneier.com/page/60/,Attacking Driverless Cars with Projected Images,"Abstract: The absence of deployed vehicular communication systems, which prevents the advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs) and autopilots of semi/fully autonomous cars to validate their virtual perception regarding the physical environment surrounding the car with a third party, has been exploited in various attacks suggested by researchers. Since the application of these attacks comes with a cost (exposure of the attacker’s identity), the delicate exposure vs. application balance has held, and attacks of this kind have not yet been encountered in the wild. In this paper, we investigate a new perceptual challenge that causes the ADASs and autopilots of semi/fully autonomous to consider depthless objects (phantoms) as real. We show how attackers can exploit this perceptual challenge to apply phantom attacks and change the abovementioned balance, without the need to physically approach the attack scene, by projecting a phantom via a drone equipped with a portable projector or by presenting a phantom on a hacked digital billboard that faces the Internet and is located near roads. We show that the car industry has not considered this type of attack by demonstrating the attack on today’s most advanced ADAS and autopilot technologies: Mobileye 630 PRO and the Tesla Model X, HW 2.5; our experiments show that when presented with various phantoms, a car’s ADAS or autopilot considers the phantoms as real objects, causing these systems to trigger the brakes, steer into the lane of oncoming traffic, and issue notifications about fake road signs. In order to mitigate this attack, we present a model that analyzes a detected object’s context, surface, and reflected light, which is capable of detecting phantoms with 0.99 AUC. Finally, we explain why the deployment of vehicular communication systems might reduce attackers’ opportunities to apply phantom attacks but won’t eliminate them."

With little more than a plastic contraption that looks a bit like a Boggle set and an accompanying web app to scan the resulting dice roll, DiceKeys creates a highly random, mathematically unguessable key. You can then use that key to derive master passwords for password managers, as the seed to create a U2F key for two-factor authentication, or even as the secret key for cryptocurrency wallets. Perhaps most importantly, the box of dice is designed to serve as a permanent, offline key to regenerate that master password, crypto key, or U2F token if it gets lost, forgotten, or broken."

While the proposed privacy initiative was initially met with significant opposition, particularly from large technology companies, some of that opposition faded in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Mark Zuckerberg’s April 2018 testimony before Congress. By May 2018, the initiative appeared to have garnered sufficient support to appear on the November 2018 ballot. On June 21, 2018, the sponsors of the ballot initiative and state legislators then struck a deal:  in exchange for withdrawing the initiative, the state legislature would pass an agreed version of the California Consumer Privacy Act. The initiative was withdrawn, and the state legislature passed (and the Governor signed) the CCPA on June 28, 2018."

Those closest to us know the answers to our secret questions, have access to our devices, and can exercise coercive power over us. We survey a range of intimate relationships and describe their common features. Based on these features, we explore implications for both technical privacy design and policy, and offer design recommendations for ameliorating intimate privacy risks."

In this guest essay, Rainer Enders, CTO of Americas at NCP engineering, explains why they’ve become the a weak link in network defenses.)Mobile technology companies focus first and foremost on consumers rather than the corporate market. As such, most mobile operating systems lack many of basic security features. What’s more, with so many models from myriad manufacturers running on different versions of a platform such as Android, there is a glaring lack of consistency and basic security protocols.Cyber criminals are targeting mobile devices more than traditional PCs, and, astoundingly, companies continue to let these devices run rampant and unmanaged on their networks.No employee wants to be the one to unlock the door and let cyber criminals in. That, however, doesn’t stop it from happening. New research also shows that an estimated one million high-risk Android applications will get introduced into corporate networks this year.Another recent study analyzed 2 million currently available Android apps, from both third parties and the Google Play store, classifying 293,091 as outright malicious and an additional 150,203 as high-risk. When you factor in iOS, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry and any other mobile platforms, the IT landscape is no longer centered on securing an exclusively Windows-based ecosystem.Mobile security is a systemic problem, largely due to the business world’s inability to either comprehend or acknowledge that the status quo will no longer suffice. The only way to safely approach the use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices in the corporate sphere is to proactively manage how they are used.Enterprises also cannot afford to continue the tried-and-no-longer-true practice of operating siloed security systems that react to attacks after they have already been hit. By then, it is too late. Instead, they need to bring together and connect the best of the best from all corners.IT departments need to … more"

Mary Bono Mack, R-Calif., citing concerns that a privacy  hearing Mack will convene on Thursday is being staged to give short  shrift to how Europe has championed privacy rights for individual  citizens.The hearing, titled “Internet Privacy: The Impact and Burden of EU Regulation,” will be held tomorrow before the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, chaired by Bono Mack.“This  hearing could throw cold water on efforts to enact strong privacy  protections, such as those that exist in Europe, in the United States,”  says Susan Grant, consumer protection director at the Consumer Federation of America.  “The absence of any witnesses in support of the European approach to  data protection is very disappointing. The hearing is therefore likely  to present a skewed picture of what’s happening in Europe and, by  extension, what’s needed here at home. ”Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy,  says the hearing “is squarely with an industry agenda” and says he  believes Bono Mack is “working with industry to undermine a call for  privacy rules.”Bono Mack told Technology Live that she believes European privacy regulations “don’t seem to be working as well as intended. ”“But  let me be clear about one thing,” says Bono Mack. “To date, I do not  believe industry has proven that it’s doing enough to protect American  consumers, while government, unfortunately, tends to overreach every  time it gets involved in the marketplace.”Online tracking and  data aggregation, in support of Internet advertising, has become a red  hot issue in Congress.

AcohidoTarget’s massive databreach took place just a few weeks before a set of payment card industry standards – known as PCI DSS 3.0 – were scheduled to go into effect. CyberTruth asked Nick Aceto, technology director at software vendor CardConnect, to supply some clarity.CT: What does this latest databreach tell us about the efficacy of PCI?Aceto: We can’t say definitely that this breach is a failure of Target’s PCI compliance, but based on what Target has said, it’s very hard to believe that they were even PCI 2.0 compliant at the time of the breach.A reason for thinking this is that the attack, involving an enormous amount of data, went on essentially unnoticed for 18 days. How were they not watching the network?One of the PCI DSS requirements is that you monitor your logs and firewalls every day, looking for unusual activity. This monitoring involves file integrity checks and changes to critical systems files. What’s more – the chapter 6 software development life cycle requires the secure distribution and verification of payment applications.Unusual activity isn’t always abnormal, but the point of PCI is to monitor and verify that all activity is normal, while not letting distractions – like busy shopping days Black Friday and Cyber Monday, on which the breach occurred – detract from the monitoring effort.CT: The PCI standards are about to be upgraded; how might that help deter fraud, moving forward?Aceto: One requirement under PCI DSS 3.0 is that merchants must evaluate malware threats for all platforms. It used to be that you just had to evaluate malware threats against platforms that were common malware victims.Now, in 3.0, merchants must identify malware threats for all platforms, from tablets all the way up to their in-store swipe terminals. Had Target implemented this 3.0 step, it might have helped to better anticipate or detect the attack.Another change in 3.0 is … more"

The technique discovered by the payment card giant involved installing a memory-parsing program on Windows-based cash register systems and back-of-house (BOH) servers. The clever piece of malware was designed to extract data from magnetic-striped payment card transactions.By last November security analysts and forensic investigators were quietly discussing cases of big retail chains getting hit by memory parsing attacks, says Avivah Litan, banking security analyst at research firm Gartner.“I can’t give you names, but there were others hit,” Litan says. “Target got hit the biggest.”The breaches of customer databases at Target, Neiman Marcus and other yet-to-be-disclosed retail chains have all the earmarks of a methodical attack used in cyber espionage known as an Advanced Persistent Threat.An APT attack often begins with intelligence gathering.

The tiny thumbs-up icons appears alongside news stories, videos and other content on numerous popular websites, including Huffington Post, CNN, ESPN and Yelp. If you click on such an icon and are one of Facebook’s 500 millionÃ‚Â  users, an identicalÃ‚Â  thumbs-up icon will automatically embed on your profile page along with a link to the content. This signals your friends that you think the content is worthwhile checking out.Privacy advocates are critical of Like buttons because they happen to also enable Facebook to track people as they switch from one web site to the next, supplying information about online behavior that’s salable to advertisers.And now cyber scammers have figured out how to cause malicious Like buttons to turn up on Facebook users’ profile pages. They begin by manipulating a Facebook account for which they’ve stolen the username and password, typically one that has a long list of friends. The initial step: embed a Like button with an enticing link on the profile page of that account. The link touts a hot topic — examples include news about the popular game Farmville or the hit movie Sex and the City 2, says Panda Labs rearcher Sean-Paul Correll, who has intercepted and examined samples.Clicking on the link takes you to a web page filled with online ads.

The so-called Internet “kill switch” may — or may not — be part of the currently proposed Lieberman-Collins Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act, depending on who you talk to. In this guest LastWatchdog guest blog post, Patricia Titus, Chief Information Security Officer, Unisys Federal, sorts through this tempest in a teapot.By Patricia TitusThe 2009 proposed bill, introduced by Sen. John Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), clearly called for a Presidential internet kill switch and spawned visuals of President Obama sitting in the Oval Office with his hand hovering over an Ã¢â‚¬Å“easy button.Ã¢â‚¬ÂSeveral industry groups spent countless hours debating the language of that earlier bill and its implications, offering guidance to the members and staffers writing the legislation.  In response to this, Sen. Joseph Lieberman (ID-CT) softened the language in his bill and added good clarifying terms.  In my estimation, there is currently no language that would suggest an Ã¢â‚¬Å“internet kill switchÃ¢â‚¬Â is being placed in the hands of the President.  Rather the language allows decision making within the executive branch to protect our national interests and critical infrastructure, and achieve this through consensus.The Lieberman bill highlights the need for a public/private partnership to help set policy to define what constitutes a cyber attack.  This is where many of us are skeptical.  For years weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been hearing the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“public/private partnershipÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“P-cubed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already seen several examples of failed P-cubed.

Obama has been silent on the topic, as internal White House debate continues about the naming of a cybersecurity adviser reporting directly to Obama. Here are three perspectives on the delay:Patricia Titus, Chief Information Security Officer, Unisys Federal Systems. LastWatchdog guest blog post. 15Sept2009While the delay in appointing a national cyber security coordinator is cause for concern, the dearth of information on the roles and responsibilities of this official is perhaps even more disturbing.The current cyber security crisis continues to take a backseat to other pressing Obama Administration hot ticket items. Recent questions and concerns over the resignation of Melissa Hathaway and Mischel Kwon, two cyber security experts, has cast a shadow on the growing void of government professionals with depth in this critical field at the senior executive level.While reports indicate the shortlist for filling the position is shrinking, the announcement could still be weeks away – casting doubts on if this remains a true priority for this administration. More delays could come while the coordinator fills key positions and secures funding.The urgent need for an appointment has been underscored by the continued cyber attacks reported over the past months. For example, on July 4, we saw paralyzing Distributed Denial-of -Service attacks that choked off access to the resources of the federal government and key financial institutions. Since then, the government has not released any information to explain who was responsible or if any other malicious activity took place during this attack.This lack of information is precisely the type of issue the private sector anticipates the Cyber Security Coordinator will address by facilitating policy and organizational changes to ensure that accurate and concise attack data is provided to key stakeholders. This will assist in awareness and provide critical infrastructure owners the ability to remediate vulnerabilities to stifle further attacks.… more"

The top dozen or so cybercriminal rings command massive botnets honed to automate and scale up the delivery of spam scams, the carrying out of denial-of-service attacks, the booby-trapping of legit websites and the hijacking of online financial accounts.Botnets can’t be stopped largely because the bad guys have mastered a technique, called polymorphism, by which they continually tweak the underlying malicious code to stay a step ahead of the latest security updates.Shape’s co-founders came up with the notion of using polymorphism against the bad guys. Shape’s technology doesn’t bother trying to detect botnet activity. Instead, it continually scrambles the exchange of information taking place between a Web server and a Web site visitor, be it a legit user or a malicious bot.Gartner banking security analyst Avivah Litan credits Shape for breaking new ground. “You’ve got to hand it to them, they did something revolutionary, and you don’t see revolutionary technology very often,” Litan says. “No one ever comes up with new ideas in security.

Our society is now dependent on Internet connectivity. But we have blithely ignored the need to protect ourselves from its darker side. The public perception of cyber-criminals is of spotty faced, anti-social pranksters.Unfortunately, we are in an extraordinarily vulnerable position, and every aspect of our on-line society and critical infrastructure is being actively probed for vulnerabilities.

But there is one other employee type that’s often overlooked – and perhaps the most dangerous of all.Fresh statistics from Cisco prove the dangers of organizations’ resident “techies” – mostly Gen Y, technologically-savvy individuals who are often touted for their IT expertise and technical know-how. This is a generation that grew up in an online world, accustomed to its freedom of access.As they graduate college and enter the workforce, they bring with them those same expectations of access and availability. Patterns have shown that it’s these very Gen Y workers who are most likely to demand elevated privileges when it comes to IT systems and network usage.And the profiling of these “risky” employees can be narrowed further still – in a survey of 1,500 IT professionals, 80 percent pointed to male employees between the ages of 20 to 35-years-old, as those most likely to demand elevated rights.IT heads are now faced with the mounting demands of these younger employees.

But in today’s cyber landscape they also need to go a few steps further. In this LastWatchdog guest blog post, Chris Larsen, Blue Coat’s Senior Software Engineer, explains why.By Chris LarsenMany years ago, a group of Blue Coat engineers — most of whom were fathers with young children at home — became concerned about the often blatant pornography that their children might see on the Internet. Blue Coat develops web filtering software that let’s companies and organizations control employee’s access to approved web sites. The engineers convinced  management to let them create a web filter for home computers — and to give it away for free.Over the years, they got a lot of e-mails from grateful parents, which made them smile. They also got a few angry ones from those parents’ teenagers, which made them smile even more. The K9 software also generated some positive publicity for their company, as they’d hoped it would, although most people outside of large corporate IT departments probably still don’t know who Blue Coat is.K9 continues to do a great job of blocking porn for concerned families, the web filtering world has changed in the last few years, for both the corporate and the home environments. As the web browser has become the primary vector for malware to spread and infect computers, our primary focus has shifted from blocking objectionable content to blocking malicious content.So today, K9 WebProtection does more than enable parents to restrict the webpages their kids can access. It also delivers protection from malware. K9’s basic anti-malware protection works by warning or preventing a user from pursuing a link (URL) that leads to malware or phishing.However, it does not provide content scanning as provided with anti-virus software. Therefore, a full desktop antivirus suite … more"

The exchanges don’t actually store information – they simply link to it.That doesn’t mean they’re less valuable as targets, from a hacker’s perspective, but it does reduce the threat a little, as an attacker can’t get the data directly from the site, but must instead breach at least two sites – the exchange and the government data portal it’s linking to.Secondly, despite statements to the contrary, the exchanges have undergone security auditing – it just hasn’t been as thorough and rigorous as many would have liked to see. This is an enormous undertaking and some elements of it appear to have been rushed in order to meet deadlines.As any developer knows, rushing a project, particularly one as massive and unprecedented as the ACA rollout, is likely to result in some errors. Another concern is that the exchange system isn’t completely run by the federal government – at least 14 states so far have their own exchanges.Typically, state governments do not have the same level of resources as the federal government when it comes to cybersecurity. In fact, a recent study by Deloitte-NASCIO found that only 24 percent of state chief information security officers are confident they can thwart hack attacks.Will this result in a two-tier security system? Additionally, web security is still way behind the times – a recent study by Veracode found that 70 percent of web applications fail basic security standards.

But the problem comes with one silver lining. Each time a successful insider threat strikes, it pushes agencies to bolster their cybersecurity programs.The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) Change 2 is an example of just that. Released by the U.S. Department of Defense in May 2016, NISPOM Change 2 mandates federal contractors implement an insider threat program. One key requirement went into effect on May 31, mandating contractors hold insider threat employee awareness training for all cleared employees before being granted access to classified information and annually thereafter.The requirement is a positive step in tackling the insider threat problem. The training includes a section on consequences for breaking the rules, using real world examples of insiders who have faced prison time and hefty fines, such as Pvt. Bradley Manning being convicted and sentenced to serve a 35-year sentence at the maximum-security U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth.Related infographic: How training can translate into a ‘human firewall’It also educates employees on common behavior patterns that may indicate an insider is about to turn, such as frequent trips outside the United States or working strange hours. Finally, the training explains who to contact if an employee identifies a potential insider threat.One drawback to the mandate is that it requires contractors to conduct training only once a year. In addition to spending 25-plus years working in the federal government, I also majored in psychology at Towson University. One lesson I learned is that if you want the human mind to retain a lot of information, it must be broken down into smaller chunks and exposed to the data frequently. Security awareness training of any kind should include 7- to 10-minute sessions that focus on specific policies violated.Test employees’ awarenessFor example, if a contract employee innocently sent private government … more"

Here was a young American, exiled for now in Russia, comparing himself to Pentagon Papers whistle-blower Daniel Ellsberg, thoughtfully explaining his views on privacy and mass surveillance, and subtly laying groundwork for a hoped-for return to his homeland—on his terms.Whatever happens to Snowden from here on out, and whether you believe Snowden is a patriot or a traitor, there is no doubt he is a historical figure who riveted global attention on individual privacy and data security at a time when powerful forces are moving to reshape our long-held definitions of human rights.Related: Russian cyber spies assist in Ukraine occupationThat Snowden was able to appear at IDT911’s privacy conference via a Google Plus Hangout video chat session, blown up on two massive screens, with nearly imperceptible lag, was an ironic wonder. (Full disclosure: IDT911 sponsors ThirdCertainty.com)Most people don’t realize that Google may be the largest computer hardware manufacturer on the planet. And it has just one client: Google. It’s gargantuan, proprietary data centers whip out answers to our search queries in the blink of an eye, and supply cool cloud services, like its globe-spanning video chat channel, for free.The irony stems from the fact that Google’s data centers, and others like them used by Facebook, Apple, Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft, are the engines behind the voracious hoovering of online communications of every Internet user—the very data the National Security Agency has used to conduct mass surveillance on ordinary citizens, which we never would have known about without Snowden’s whistle-blowing.Snowden spent more than an hour drilling down on his rationale for … more"

In this LastWatchdog guest post, Chet Wisniewski, Sophos senior security advisor, expresses his concerns about such attitudes.By Chester WisniewskiIn the first half of 2010 two notable incidents raised awareness of cyber-war and cyber-espionage among computer users. Google and other companies were compromised during the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Operation AuroraÃ¢â‚¬Â attacks and Google pointed a finger at China, insisting the attack was politically motivated and the work of the Chinese government.We also recently saw a new zero-day exploit in Windows used in an attempt to compromise critical infrastructure, the level of sophistication of which implies government sponsorship. All of this has sparked a debate among users about whether governments should engage in this activity.Scary attitudesIn a poll of 1077 computer users, 63% said they believe that it is acceptable for their country to spy on other nations by installing malware or by hacking. Seven percent of those polled think that using crippling denial of service attacks against another country’s communications or financial infrastructure is acceptable during peacetime.This attitude scares me. We seem to be reacting out of panic to a perceived threat in a way that will only cause the problem to escalate. I prefer the views of my colleague Paul Ducklin, who suggested we hijack this idea of cyber-warfare and turn it into cyber-victory. We should come together to better secure our computers for the sake of more secure nations.You may differentiate between cyber-espionage and directly attacking another nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infrastructure to cause harm or denial of service, but we should not enter the 21st century with either cold-war style spy tactics or stockpiles of virtual weapons.Productive discussionsUnfortunately SophosLabs are now processing more than 60,000 new malware samples per day, a 50% increase since this time last year.

He devised a currency tied to a predictable, rare asset: high-end mathematical computations.Nakamoto issued the first bitcoin with a value of less than a penny. Approximately every 10 minutes, more coins would be issued through a lottery-like process to anyone who could solve a complex math problem. His idea was to release a finite number of bitcoins over a 20 year time span.The concept caught fire.

To earn the $300, the victim is required to cash the check and execute the wire transfer within 24 hours.Stewart has discovered digital images of some $9 million worth of high-quality fake checks, each in amounts of slightly less than $3,000, written against some 1,200 business accounts. Many of the accounts are for contractors who often pay individual subcontractors with such checks.The checks are so good because the cyber gang hacked into the databases of three firms that archive images of legit commercial business checks.The criminals downloaded all the images they could find, grabbing bank routing numbers, names and addresses and even signatures of legitimate account holders. They used the information to create their own checks using easy-to-acquire software and printers.“Presumably this scam has been working because they’ve been doing it for at lest a year and they wouldn’t be doing it this long if it were not making them money,” says Stewart.SecureWorks says it is working with the FBI and says the hackers have not been caught.The Internet-based check kiting scheme underscores how creative and efficient cybercrooks have become.

He then went to work for EMC, leading its content management and archiving software division. He left EMC in 2007 to take the reins as CEO of then-struggling McAfee.Again he steered a course of growth through acquisitions and aggressive salesmanship; in negotiating with Intel, he was able to boast that he had turned around McAfee into a double-digit annual growth company with nearly 80 percent gross profit margin.Fair acquisition priceAndrew Jaquith, tech security industry analyst at Forrester, notes in this post that the $7.7 billion Intel will pay for McAfee, when the deal closes, translates into roughly five times the last trailing four quarters’ revenues, about typical for M&A deals in the security industry.“The price is not so high that it makes Intel look like Daddy Warbucks, but not so low that it looks like McAfee was desperate to sell,” observes Jaquith.DeWalt’s new boss, Renee James, Intel’s senior vice president of software and services, has assigned him to run McAfee pretty much as is: fast-growing, highly-profitable, wholly-owned subsidiary.In a LastWatchdog interview, James declined to give much detail about longer range plans to infuse McAfee’s security expertise into Intel’s struggling Atom chip for Internet-connected mobile … more"

ITRC surveyed 317 people who used the organization’s services in 2017 and had experienced identity theft. The study was sponsored by CyberScout, which also sponsors ThirdCertainty. A few highlights:• Nearly half, 48.4 percent, of data breach victims were confused about what to do
• Only 56 percent took advantage of identity theft protection services offered after a breach
• Some 61 percent declined identity theft services due to lack of understanding or confusion
• Some 32 percent didn’t know where to turn for help in event of a financial loss due to identify theft.Keep your guard upThese psychological shock waves, no doubt, are coming into play yet again for 143 million consumers who lost sensitive information in the Equifax breach. The ITRC findings suggest that many Equifax victims are likely to be frightened, confused and frustrated to the point of acquiescence. That’s because the digital lives we lead come with risks no one foresaw at the start of this century. And the reality is that consumers need to be constantly vigilant about their digital life.

Suffice it to say, merchants haven’t exactly welcomed it with open arms. PCI DSS version 2.0 was released on 28 Oct. 2010. In this LastWatchdog guestpost, Amichai Shulman,  co-founder and chief technical officer of Imperva, examines its implications.By Amichai ShulmanSince its inception in 2005 and first implementation in 2006, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) has had a substantial effect on data and application security. In an era where governments are struggling with the creation of vague yet complex data protection acts the credit card industry took a bold step towards self-regulation, using plain simple language, clear attainable goals and the spirit of pragmatism.Without lengthy articles of penal codes the PCI DSS standards is making its way, consistently into overall adoption by organizations worldwide.  How?In just four years, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen how organizations have reacted.  A survey performed by the Ponemon Institute and Imperva late in September 2009 found that fact that 19% of respondents regarded PCI cynically, doing the bare minimum required for becoming compliant, including cutting corners and taking the most lenient interpretation of the standard whenever possible.On the brighter side, just more than half, 54%, took a checklist approachÃ¢â‚¬â€going through the motions of compliance.  However, most encouraging, a solid 27% of respondents capitalized on PCI compliance, turning it into a strategic initiative.  The result?  This group of companies enjoyed a stronger security posture, displaying a true reduction in the number of data breaches they suffer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a reduction that is contrary to the general trend of an increased number of data loss incidents.To be clear, PCI is no magic.

Blue Coat malware expert Chris Larsen, who helped design K-9 Web Protection, a terrific free parental control tool, offers these tips for staying on high alert regarding poisoned search results.1.)  For text searches, look at the two lines of “flavor text” that Google and Bing display. Look for disjointed, random text, like it was mashed up by a computer (because it was).2.) Look at the Domain name. Is it one you’ve heard of? Does it seem to have something to do with the topic you were searching for?3.) Google now has a “preview” feature, where text-search results have a little button to the right that looks like this: >> If you hover your mouse on it, it will display an image of the page. This lets you see if the page “looks legit”. (Until now, the Bad Guys didn’t have to worry about how their poisoned pages looked, since humans never saw them.)4.) Know a little bit about “Top Level Domains” (TLDs). There are a lot of two-letter TLDs assigned to specific countries: .RU = Russia, .IN = India, etc. If you’re searching for a US-culture topic, like Halloween costume ideas, or Thanksgiving recipes, or Christmas decorations, and your search returns results on .RU or .IN, etc., ask yourself if it’s likely that a site hosted there would really have good content about your search topic.5.) Use K9 on your computer, since it will block many of the malnets that run SEP-based attacks.6.)  The next time you need to search for something, try out k9safesearch.com. The search results you get by using this search engine, instead of Google or Bing, are filtered by Blue Coat’s security and privacy technologies.–Byron Acohido"

I also spoke with SlashNext, a startup that specializes in detecting stealthy botnet activity.Related article: Russian botnets ignite social media blitzThere’s much we can discern from the distinctive ebb and flow of botnet-borne malicious activity. ‘Classic’ botnets are comprised of vast numbers of infected PCs, servers and virtual computing nodules. One of particular note is called Necurs, a massive botnet-for-hire and the king of delivering phishing email attacks, ransomware campaigns and Banking Trojans.Then there are any number of smaller, single-purpose botnets owned and operated by nation-state-backed hacking rings. The obvious example: the Russian botnet operators who orchestrated the wave of social media spoofing and propagandizing designed to influence political discourse and meddle in elections in the U.S. and all across Europe. the most recent example: Russian botnets hyped the hyped the #Releasethememo campaign on Twitter to lend credence to Rep. Devin Nunes’, R-Calif.,  secret ‘memo’ purportedly discrediting and disqualifying the FBI from investigating Russia’s meddling in the last U.S. election. That came after Russian botnets fueled wildly conflicting polling results during the 2016 presidential race, and fabricated 6.1 million Twitter followers for then-candidate Trump.Meanwhile, a new generation of Internet of Things botnets has arrived on the scene.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke ordered that federal civilian agencies identify Kaspersky Lab software on their networks. After 90 days, unless otherwise directed, they must remove the software, on the grounds that the company has connections to the Russian government, and its software poses a security risk.The Department of Homeland Security “is concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks,” the department said in a statement. “The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.” Source: The Washington Post Lawsuits against Equifax start to pile up after massive data breachEquifax is facing nearly two dozen class-action lawsuits, along with a separate suit from Massachusetts, over the data breach that compromised the personal information—names, addresses, birth dates and Social Security numbers—of more than 143 million people.

They rightfully wonder why their office IT services can’t seem to keep up.Technology adoption is moving faster than security, as mobile devices, social media, and the cloud become commonplace. Regardless of the risks, the genie clearly is out of the bottle when it comes to BYOD adoption.A PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that 88% of consumers use a personal mobile device for both personal and work purposes.

But even if investigators do solve those puzzles, it’s unlikely details will be publicly disclosed.Breached enterprises generally do not discuss the results of forensic investigations. But there is another way to stay informed about cybercriminals’ tricks of the trade.In this LastWatchdod guest post, Amichai Shulman, Co-Founder and CTO of Imperva, describes what Imperva has recently learned by listening in.By Amichai ShulmanCan you imagine an army showing up on a battlefield with insufficient knowledge of the opponentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ weapons or tactics? General Custer tried itÃ¢â‚¬â€once. The importance of proper intelligence cannot be underestimated.Hackers have high incentives to continue evolving techniques and attack vectors, such as automating tools, the same way security vendors do. Hackers pride themselves on new innovations, so platforms grow at a pace that is very difficult to monitor without dedicated effort.However, hackers actually make it easy for savvy security research. Largely, hackers are egotistical and narcissistic and joining certain hacker forums is relatively easy.  They discuss tools, techniques and technologies of their trade. Feeding off attention, hackers often boast about their exploits.For example, in December 2009, a hacker boasted about breaching Rockyou.com and exfiltrating 32 million. But few other hackers believed it. To remove any doubts, the hacker posted all 32 million passwords for a few hours.  We downloaded the list and analyzed it, revealing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“123456Ã¢â‚¬Â was the most commonly used password and providing consumers worldwide insight into how to improve their password security practice.Hackers also post information about the tricks of their trade.  They post, for instance, kits for developing hacking campaigns or source code for hacking software.  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve analyzed these efforts from a technical perspective to understand how hacking activity changes.  The most … more"
1641448583-946,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/65,MY TAKE: Equifax hack highlights exposures caused by wide use of open-source protocols,"By Byron V. AcohidoA major takeaway from the Equifax debacle that hasn’t gotten enough attention is this: The massive data theft happened because of a vulnerability in an open-source component, which the credit bureau failed to lock down.Remember Heartbleed and Shellshock, the two massive security flaws discovered in open-source internet protocols back in 2014? The waves of network attacks that preyed on those flaws showed how open-source protocols—which over the years have become so widely used in business networks—actually comprise a ripe attack vector just waiting to be exploited.Related article: Beware of open-source vulnerabilities lurking all through your networkThe hackers leveraged a vulnerability in something called Apache Struts, an open-source application framework that supports the credit bureau’s web portal. It is widely used by developers of Fortune 100 companies to build web applications. In Equifax’s case, hackers used the flaw to access and remove copies of files for over two months, between May 13 and July 30, 2017.When it seemed like the breach couldn’t get any worse for Equifax, the company also revealed that they knew about the vulnerability and tried to patch it in March.Vulnerabilities are commonAs Jeff Williams, co-founder and CTO of Contrast Security explains, “Essentially, an attacker could send a single HTTP request—just like the ones your browser sends—except with a specially crafted header that contains the attack. Through a series of unfortunate events, the Struts framework treats this header as an expression, effectively running the attacker’s code on the server.”"

AcohidoSo NortonLifeLock has acquired Avast for more than $8 billion.This deal reads like to the epilogue to a book titled The First 20 Years of the Supremely Lucrative Antivirus Market. Way back in 1990, Symantec acquired Norton Utilities and made Norton the heart of its antivirus subscription offering.Related: The coming of ubiquitous passwordless accessThis was around the same time antivirus vendors like Trend Micro, McAfee, Kaspersky, ESET, Sophos, Bitdefender, Avira, AVG and Avast were staking out turf in what they saw, very accurately, as a profitable new software subscription market.A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. Norton got ‘demergered’ from Symantec in 2014 and then acquired LifeLock for $2.3 billion in 2017; Avast acquired AVG  for $1.3 billion in 2016, for instance.Meanwhile, native security is increasingly being built into popular operating systems, and there’s a trend toward beefing up application security, as well. These are eminently complex times. Companies are migrating to the cloud IT; consumers are working from home much more often.NortonLifeLock and Avast appear to be betting on the next iteration of the huge and longstanding consumer antivirus market. Last Watchdog asked Forrester analyst Allie Mellen to connect the dots –- and clarify the significance — for individual consumers:"

Turns out that hijacking an iTunes account is very straight forward. For at least the past year, iTunes hijackers have been buying stolen usernames and passwords from phishers and data thieves.They then log on, test a few $1 purchases, and, if they clear, move on to larger transactions.Ã‚Â  They most often purchase iTunes gift card codes, usually in $50 to $200 amounts, says Kurt Baumgartner, Senior Security Researcher, Kaspersky Lab.They then sell the iTunes gift cards codes Ã¢â‚¬â€ which can be used like cash to buy music and videos directly from Apple Ã¢â‚¬â€ at a steep discount. Discounted iTunes gift cards are openly sold onlinie.Updated gift card scamTheseÃ‚Â  iTunes gift card scams mirror the analogue gift-card scam made infamous by Miamians Albert Gonzalez and Irving Escobar, bit players in the TJX/Wal-Mart capers. Gonzalez, you may recall, was a key operative in the ring that hacked retail giant TJX and stole 94 million credit card transaction records. (Initially reported as only 45.7 million.) The stolen credit card numbers were transferred to the magnetic strips on the backs of batches of counterfeit Visa cards. The faked credit cards were then distributed to street toughs, like Escobar, who used them to buy $400 Wal-Mart gift cards, en masse.iTunes hijackers can bypass several of those steps, thanks to the way Apple has integrated gift cards into iTunes. They simply log on, buy gift-card “codes” using the default payment mechanism, then put the freshly purchased gift-card codes up for sale online.They’ve also begun experimenting with using hijacked accounts to purchase large quantities of $5 apps sold by co-conspirators who set up and run “app farms.” Keep in mind these app … more"

Both must flourish separately and together to fuel “digital transformation” in a way that makes our connected world as  secure as it needs to be.Related article: Machine-learning does heavy-liftingData science focuses more on data structures, algorithms and computability. Cybersecurity emphasizes knowledge of systems administration, architecture, operating systems and web applications. However, both data science and cybersecurity rely on proficiency across a shared base of technical knowledge.Both disciplines also call on someone to properly assess the information before them, put it into the appropriate context and make proper decisions based upon it. Despite some differences between the two fields, there are many commonalities to explore.Data science involves the gathering of data from multiple sources and sifting through it to analyze critical information and what it means for the future. This helps gain insights into how an entity (i.e., program, business, industry, trend and so on) is performing and how it can improve. The data also helps in forecasting how the entity will continue performing into the future or perhaps how it would do when faced with an obstacle (such as competition, a recession or other market or economic factors). The more data we have, the better insights we can reach and the better predictions we can make.Two-sides, same coinWith data science becoming so prominent, cybersecurity is needed to protect the underlying data. Universities, huge corporations and governments depend upon the data they have to properly run and grow. Hackers can infiltrate computer systems and manipulate the data on them for nefarious purposes, such as identity theft, fraud, or in the most sophisticated instances, state-sponsored cyber warfare.

He has more than 30 years of experience assisting companies of all sizes with information-security issues. In an interview with LastWatchdog, Hall confirmed that ATM fraud using counterfeit debit cards and stolen personal identification numbers is occurring more often than the general public realizes. And he outlined what companies and consumers should do about it. LW: To what extent are data thieves in the hunt for payment registers in department stores, supermarkets, professional services offices — anywhere payment checkout terminals are used and not closely guarded?Hall: Criminals are scouting vulnerable venues. We are aware of a number of private instances where payment terminals and point-of-sales registers have been tampered with to obtain credit card and other data. The concern extends to data networks, medical devices, automobiles, TV sets — essentially any electronic device. All electronic devices today run some sort of operating system. As such, they can all be misused if the right person can insert themselves into the process at the right point. LW: Why are they increasingly focusing on debit card mag stripe data, account numbers and PINs? Hall: Debit cards are tied directly to someone’s bank account. As a result, there is typically a high likelihood of tapping into a large amount of cash quickly. Mag stripe data is fairly easy to come by. If you have complete mag stripe data with a PIN, you can completely impersonate the real card.  STORY: Data thieves target debit cards at point of saleLW: What can or should retailers, doctors’ offices and others be doing to mitigate this threat?Hall: Only contract with a reliable terminal supplier. Organizations should ask a supplier of terminals what they do to ensure terminals do not get tampered with. Also, lock down terminals. Terminals that are not locked down are easy to quickly swap out with a doctored unit. And … more"

Here are three views contributed exclusively to CyberTruth:Scott Hazdra, principal security consultant, Neohapsis: Every organization has to strike a balance between granting access and protecting their information assets. Employees, contractors, consultants and vendors all require some level of access to perform their jobs. Information should be classified as to whether it’s public, internal only or classified.There should be rules in place as to who can access the different categories of information. And there should be proper controls around the information itself. In the end, it’s also entirely possible that an organization does everything right, but someone with access and authority makes a decision at odds with that of the organization.  Eric Chiu, founder and president, HyTrust: Insiders by definition are already inside or within your organization and generally have access to corporate and sensitive information. Systems administrators in particular, although low level, typically have the highest access to systems and data, given that they manage those systems.Without implementing adequate role-based access, companies and organizations are giving god-like access to their systems administrators with those privileged accounts.Andy Hubbard, senior security consultant at Neohapsis: Organizations, even today, make the mistake of assuming that internal systems are safe from tampering and access. Insiders are often provisioned with access to shares, applications, and data storage locations without any review. In order to ease administrative burden, users are provided access to system resources based on generalized access requirements, which may overlook or disregard data access controls that should be in place.Users within many environments are indiscrete with where and how they store data that they are working with.

Key findings:  38% of breaches hit larger organizations   37% affected financial organizations  24% occurred at retailers and restaurants  20% involved manufacturing, transportation and utilities.“Verizon’s newest report indicates that most data breaches involve stolen credentials, backdoors and brute force attacks,” says HyTrust president and founder, Eric Chiu. “In addition, it confirms what HyTrust has also found– that the vast majority of breaches aren’t detected until months after compromise.”Nathaniel Couper-Noles, senior security consultant at security firm Neohapsis adds that cybercriminals continue to get better at finding and taking advantages of security weaknesses intrinsic to complex networks.“The breadth of successful attacks in the report shows that technological innovations can benefit attackers as well as defenders,” says Couper-Noles.Andy Green, analyst at Varonis Systems, notes that Verizon’s report emphasizes that 80% of breaches could be easily prevented with two-factor authentication, and it still takes months for most breaches to be discovered.Varonis recently published a privacy survey that found 47% of resondents using multi-factor authentication for their personal e-mail accounts.  “If this trend can carry over to corporate email and intranet access, then we may finally see a dip in these low-skill, but still very effective, password-based hacks,” Green says.Another pattern Verizon’s investigators have been able to parse out, to some degree, is whether profit-motivated crook or state-sponsored spies appear to be behind corporate network intrusions.State-affiliated actors accounted for 21 percent of attacks, while organized crime groups were behind 55 percent. … more"

CyberTruth earlier reported on analysis from firewall vendor, Palo Alto Networks, revealing that the vast majority of malware seeping into company networks arrives via drive-by download.So now, we’ve asked AppRiver senior analyst Fred Touchette to drill down on how exploit kits, like RedKit and Blackhole, are helping cybercriminals circulate nasty infections all over the Internet.LW: What makes exploit kits so worrisome?Touchette: An exploit kit is essentially a software package that makes the exploitation of vulnerable websites simple for cyber criminals. They’re easy to configure, and automated. You just click a button. The user needs very little technical knowledge. And if he requires some help, some toolkit authors even offer a one-year support license included in the price of the kit. LW: What’s distinctive about kits such as Blackhole and RedKit?Touchette: The prevalence of these kits is what sets them apart from other threats. The kits remain effective over and over again. The ease of their use in addition to their effectiveness means we also end up seeing large botnets being created as a result.LW: What are the bad guys who use exploit kits typically after? Tocuhette: The goal of these attacks is to make or steal money. They cast a net and drag in whatever is found. They’ll take all of the identities and bank account information they can get their hands on.

That is the burning question in Washington these days.Privacy is receiving so much attention right now not just because of headlines about Facebook and Google and their privacy missteps, but because we live in a time when people are sharing volumes of  information about themselves and others on social networks, and when technology that can collect, share, analyze and store information about people is advancing at a staggering pace.Think geo-tracking, behavioral-targeted advertising, and sensors collecting data about us connected to the Internet.So who should be protecting our privacy?  Some say that the government should finally pass a comprehensive privacy law that strictly regulates the collection and use of data.Others say that companies using personal data have a responsibility to protect privacy, but should not be shackled by one-size-fits-all laws and regulations, lest economic progress on the Internet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of the few bright spots in the economy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be stifled.And then there are those who say people should be smart enough to protect themselves by being careful about what information they share online.So who is right?

This of course is how they get a toehold to go deeper.In this case, the attackers leveraged information gleaned from a Microsoft worker’s computing device. In a blog posting, Microsoft disclosed that it “detected information-stealing malware on a machine belonging to one of our customer support agents with access to basic account information for a small number of our customers” and that “the actor used this information in some cases to launch highly targeted attacks as part of their broader campaign.”Microsoft said it notified the targeted 150 organizations, which included “IT companies (57%), followed by government (20%), and smaller percentages for non-governmental organizations and think tanks, as well as financial services.”"

However, the link to that story today shows rewritten text and a clarification noting that ads using sophisticated tracking mechanism to identify and profile Google users is a “closely watched growth area, but it is not a large part of Google’s current revenue stream.”Testifying at a Congressional hearing on Thursday, Joseph Pasqua, vice president of research at antivirus giant Symantec warned that using a Do Not Track mechanism could result in users being “fed websites with limited content, while other users without the option set would see a richer Web page and have a more robust browsing experience.”Pasqua’s point needs to be much more closely examined. For instance, if Google gets cut off from tracking many users, would that then open the door for major media companies, like USA TODAY, the New York Times and others,Ã‚Â  to attract more untracked readers  based on quality content, and then turn around andÃ‚Â  sell that untracked, high-demographic audience to advertisers?In any case, if Congress mandates Do Not Track, as proposed by the FTC in this report, one could ultimately test Pasqua’s assertion simply by using the Do … more"

Companies such as Google, Facebook, Dropbox and Skype (Microsoft) are designed with servers that store data in plain text.Anytime plain text data lives on a third-party system, it can be decrypted and examined by third parties such as company employees, the government and lawyers with subpoenas. This is how so many tech companies were able to give up data to the NSA upon request.We may live in a surveillance state, but we’re not powerless to protect ourselves against it. Through the grassroots adoption of privacy-first technologies — those that are designed from the ground up to provide privacy — consumers and enterprises can bypass the data collection problem.There are a few simple places to start. Tor, originally built to protect the privacy of the US Navy, is a free download that lets you surf the Web anonymously. Firefox, already a popular browser, does the same thing, and for techies, GNUzilla is a GNU version of Firefox.DuckDuckGo, the Seeks Project, Startpage and YaCy are all private alternatives to search engines like Google. Look to BitMessage and RiseUp for private webmail, or Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software like Mailvelope or WebPG that lets you encrypt your existing email. There are more choices for desktop email; Mozilla Thunderbird and Evolution are examples.Crypto.cat, OTR (Off-The-Record) and Pidgin are confidential chat providers.

It was a wide-ranging, eye-opening discussion. Here are a few key takeaways I came away with:Rising cyber exposuresEnterprises today are engaged in a struggle to balance security and agility. Leveraging cloud services and IoT systems to streamline workloads makes a ton of sense. Yet cyber exposures are multiplying. Compliance penalties, lawsuits, loss of intellectual property, theft of customer personal data and loss of reputation — due to poor cyber defenses — are now getting board level attention."

As part of its marketing efforts, U-Test has been running a once-a-quarter contest by which its testers can earn cash testing certain groupings of online services.In this case, uTest paid 600 software professionals from 20 countries to click away at Amazon, Walmart.com and Target.com, then rank the e-tailers based on best pricing, ease of use, product search capacity, reviews and ratings and product comparison tools.The consensus: Amazon is more bug-free and user-friendly than rivals Walmart.com and Target.com. But uTesters also discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability at one of the three major sites. Johnston declined to name the e-retailer, noting that uTest has notified the retailer about the security hole.“Only one of the sites had a security issue, but it’s our practice to reach out to the site owner and not disclose who it is,” he says.Johnston said the vulnerability was of the type that would “allow (user) accounts to be taken over” and give an intruder full access to “all of the sensitive information in the account.”Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities show up when Web apps fail to validate user input from form fields.

The poll was conducted by security firm McAfee, a division of Intel.“A lot of organizations have yet to really lock down mobile access,” says Jamie Barnett, McAfee’s senior director of mobility products. “That tells me there is definitely an opportunity for security and compliance gaps.”An obvious risk: employee-owned smartphones, tablets and e-readers containing work-related materials that turn up missing. Some 40% of organizations responding to McAfee’s survey reported mobile devices lost or stolen, often involving the loss of critical business data.What’s more, the cyberunderground is adapting hacks and scams â€” proven to work profitably on desktops and laptops â€” to Internet-connected mobile devices, says Anup Gosh, founder of Web browser security firm Invincea.Worldwide smartphone sales are on track to top 467 million units this year, tablet PC sales should approach 70 million, and e-readers, 14.7 million, according to research firm Gartner.

This compares to just under 1.5 billion exposed records in 2,316 reported incidents during the first half of last year.If the pace continues, this year can easily surpass 2016, which saw 4,149 reported breaches that exposed 4.2 billion records (3.2 billion more than the all-time high of 2013).“I would love to say (2017) is an outlier, but it’s really a continuation of trends we’ve seen over the last few years,” says Inga Goddijn, executive vice president at Risk Based Security Inc., which provides security intelligence and analytics as well as cyber risk insurance.The driver behind this year’s high numbers is data leaks that resulted from misconfigured databases, several of them involving Chinese companies.

No matter what type of health care facility you work in—a large research hospital, clinic, regional medical center, health insurance company, or a company that provides business or clinical services for health care—the data you work with is worth millions of dollars on the dark web. And attackers can hold a hospital hostage, almost instantly halt operations, and disrupt critical medical processes.Unlike financial data, with its built-in mechanisms for stopping suspicious payments and protecting accounts, personal medical data is immutable. Once it is stolen, the individuals to whom it rightfully belongs are at risk for identity theft, impersonation and financial fraud, without any way to protect themselves.Related story: Cyber criminals follow the money … to your health care dataFor health care organizations, data breach costs are high, averaging $355 per lost or stolen record, as compared to the costs for data theft from educational ($246), research ($112), and public sector entities ($80), according to Ponemon Institute’s “2016 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Analysis.” Moreover, breached organizations often are subjected to lawsuits, which can run costs into millions of dollars. Breaches also can ruin an organization’s reputation and destroy client trust.Health care organizations should consider cyber protection a top priority. For maximum efficacy, it is best to approach cyber protection holistically.Fortunately, implementing security best practices immediately reduces the risk of cyber compromise throughout the organization. The five practices described here permit hospital CISOs, CIOs, security team, and IT teams to start protecting valuable data.Train employeesTechnical, administrative, and clinical staff must understand the importance of practices such as never sharing passwords; avoiding the use of default passwords and system configurations; changing passwords regularly; patching systems to remain current; learning to spot suspicious emails, and not clicking on embedded email links or attachments.

And while Orbitz promises that no Social Security Numbers were compromised, a lot of other data was: names, dates-of-birth, even email and street addresses. And, of course, credit card  information. Let’s not forget that.Related podcast: Why 2018 will be the year of the CISOImportantly, this was not a phishing attack. It was a system hack, and although the exact method is unknown, the hackers did target an older Orbitz platform (not Orbitz.com), as well as a partner sites (separate occasions), and were able to access records still embedded in it.  And unlike with Equifax, this also doesn’t appear to be a situation in which administrators followed blatantly terrible password security practices. These data loss situations are always somewhat harder to assess, since they can’t be directly traced back to a clear and specific bad decision.

AcohidoIn a move to blanket the Internet with encrypted website traffic, Google is moving forward with its insistence that straggling website publishers adopt HTTPS Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).Related: How PKI can secure IoTGoogle’s Chrome web browser commands a 60% market share. So the search giant has been leading the push to get 100% of websites to jettison HTTP and replace it with HTTPS. The former – Hypertext Transfer Protocol – standardized the way web browsers fetch a web page from its host server and thus made the world wide web as we know it today possible.But HTTP connections are carried out in plain text. This makes it trivial for eavesdroppers to snatch plain-text communications, such as when users fill out forms on web pages or use shopping carts or conduct online banking. This makes any personal information and details of financial transactions typed on HTTP web pages easy pickings.So along came SSL and its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), the underpinnings of secure online transactions. SSL and TLS come into play in the form of digital certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) —  vendors that diligently verify the authenticity of websites, and then also help the website owners encrypt the information consumers type into web page forms.The PKI (public key infrastructure) encryption protocol makes all this happen instantaneously, triggering a visual confirmation – the tiny green padlock preceding the HTTPS address in Chrome’s address bar.With the release its Chrome 68 browser on July 24, any web page not running HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate will display a “Not Secure” warning in Chrome’s address bar."

It’s not uncommon for one company to poach a competitor’s top sales manager – and celebrate when the new recruit brings along a customer lead list uploaded into a cloud storage account, says Darren Platt, chief technical officer of Symplified. Platt explains why in this guest essay.)Traditionally, application access took place right on the PC. In its next phase, people used a PC to access cloud-based applications. In both of these stages, IT could run software to monitor how users were behaving within those apps.Today, we’ve progressed to a stage where people use mobile devices to access apps and data residing in the Internet cloud, and IT has no control point between the apps and the users.A recent survey revealed that only 37 percent of IT professionals have visibility into what employees are doing when logged into corporate applications, and 59 percent have experienced unauthorized data access by a user whose accounts remained active when it should have been de-provisioned.This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the IT department is often not involved in bringing on cloud applications. This leads to a situation where there is no master list of applications.Without that list of applications it is very difficult to determine whether an employee’s account has been removed from all of the systems they had access to. The result is a common situation – where people have access to e-mail and other applications from former employers.It is essential for IT to have a centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) system that enables the enforcement of access policies for all of your corporate applications. This can help prevent what’s called “side-door access,” where a user logs into an application, such as Salesforce, directly and evades your monitoring mechanisms.Over the last decade standards have emerged to help solve the security issues that occur as … more"

Inexpensive, ever-watchful digital sensors are now ubiquitous.They are in laptop webcams, video-game motion sensors, smartphone cameras, utility meters, passports and employee ID cards. Step out your front door and you could be captured in a high-resolution photograph taken from the air or street by Google or Microsoft, as they update their respective mapping services. Drive down a city thoroughfare, cross a toll bridge, or park at certain shopping malls and your license plate will be recorded and time-stamped.Several developments have converged to push the monitoring of human activity far beyond what George Orwell imagined. Low-cost digital cameras, motion sensors and biometric readers are proliferating just as the cost of storing digital data is decreasing. The result: the explosion of sensor data collection and storage.Over the next couple of years, the volume of data generated by digital sensors will surpass the flow of e-mails and social-network entries combined, predicts Stephen Brobst, chief technical officer at data analytics firm Teradata. “Sensors will touch nearly every aspect of our lives,” he says.Meanwhile, technology is rapidly being developed to efficiently mine this mushrooming trove of sensor data in novel ways. Affectiva, a Waltham, Mass., start-up, for instance, recently introduced biometric wristbands capable of monitoring tiny changes in sweat-gland activity to gauge emotional reactions. Therapists are using the wristbands with autistic children to better understand emotional outbreaks.

This change in behavior is being driven by stricter enforcement of existing regulations, mounting new legislation and SEC guidance, evolving case law propagating a higher standard of care, as well as pressure from corporate board rooms where the impact of a breach on a company’s stock price is now a real concern.LW: What’s the corporate sector’s biggest worry with respect to potential new regulations? George: Opponents of legislation that would mandate information sharing about cyber-threats claim it would be too burdensome to implement and threaten civil liberties and privacy.

If you’ve ever tried installing a different AV program, without first uninstalling one from an different vendor that’s already installed, you’re familiar with the hassle that can become.Company officials say BullGuard’s new cloud-enabled virus scanner is designed to get around that, and help you clean up your Windows PC quickly and thoroughly.BullGuard has been around about 10 years, but is not as widely used by U.S. consumers as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro or Kaspersky. It’s core anti-virus suite of software is easy to use, and above average at stopping malware, according to Neil J. Rubenking, PCMag analyst who’s long been the pre-eminent reviewer of antivirus products.Alex Balan, who heads up product management at BullGuard, tells CyberTruth that BullGuard’s customers skew towards the 55-65 age range. The company hopes this new scanning tool helps attract younger customers between the ages of 24 and 45.“Young people are online and multitasking most of the time. Babysitting a security solution is not always on the top of their list of priorities,” Balan says. “We hope to attract the younger generation by speeding up the virus scan process.”"

Two-factor authentication systems issue a single-use code that must be entered in conjunction with a username and password in order to access an account or conduct an online transaction. It adds an extra step, which translates into slightly less consumer convenience. In this guest commentary, Jeff Lawson CEO and a co-founder of communications technology firm, Twilio outlines why the sacrifice of convenience is well worth it.)By Jeff LawsonTwo-factor authentication can make a big difference in keeping your information private.It’s actually a pretty simple solution that doesn’t require you to remember more complicated passwords, download special software or carry around a new gizmo. All you need is the phone in your pocket and about five seconds.Here’s how two-factor authentication works: After you enter your login name and password into a website that has sensitive information, there is a pause. To double check your identity, the website sends a secret one-time code to your phone as a text messages or even as a phone call. To gain access to your account, you have to enter the code. It takes a few seconds, but two-factor authentication adds a significant amount of protection. Even if attackers steal your username and password, they can’t get into your account without access to your phone. And if they did steal your phone, they would still need your password. Think of it as a deadbolt for your cloud data.Google added two-factor authentication to Google apps in 2010. Yahoo and Facebook added two-factor authentication the following year. Dropbox and Box offer it, and so do some financial institutions.Blue chip companies like IBM have been using two-factor authentication to protect corporate secrets for decades.

Those companies, in turn, have been sending e-mail warnings to their respective customers.In late December, American Honda Motor reported a hacker stole permission-marketing e-mail addresses for 2.2 million Honda owners and 2.7 million Acura owners. Also in December, data thieves stole 13 million e-mail addresses from the artists’ web site devianArt; 1.3 million e-mail addresses from Gawker Media and an undisclosed number of e-mail addresses from McDonalds, as reported by The Register’s Dan Goodin.All companies that comply with the federal Can-Spam Act of 2003 communicate via e-mail with consumers only after gaining the individual customer’s permission.So a cottage industry of online marketing firms has arisen to support permission marketing campaigns. This involves the company asking the individual consumer for express permission to send e-mails with account updates and/or promotions.“Permission marketing hasÃ‚Â  become the norm for online banking and online shopping,” says Thomas Jelneck, President of Orlando-based Internet marketing firm On Target Web Solutions.Exponential jump in effectivenessAnd now data thieves on the cutting edge have arrived on the scene to take full advantage.Web marketing and cybersecurity experts say there are numerousÃ‚Â  ways  scammers canÃ‚Â  utilize e-mail addresses stolen from permission-marketing campaigns to amplify their bread-and-butter criminal activities.“The Epsilon attack should be a wake-up call that targeted attacks are the wave of the future,” says Bit9 Chief Technical Officer Harry Sverdlove.“It used to be that attackers … more"

That opened people’s eyes, says Sarah Downey, privacy analyst at Abine, maker of DoNotTrackMe, a free browser add-on designed to foil tracking.“It’s not just the government,” Downey says. “It’s the private companies people use every day, like Google, Facebook and Apple. They collect the data that the government gets.”Before PRISM, U.S. consumers were lulled into complacency regarding online privacy, says Jeff Bermant, CEO of Virtual World Computing, maker of Cocoon, another free browser add-on that disrupts online tracking.“Most people just think that giving up their privacy is the cost of using the Internet,” Bermant says. “They don’t know that there are ways they can protect their data while online.”Both Cocoon and DoNotTrackMe are free browser add-ons that enable you to isolate and deflect the tracking cookies tech companies and advertisers place in your browser.

In this LastWatchdog guest post,  AlgoSec’s CTO, Professor Avishai Wool, of Tel Aviv University, makes the technical argument for more pervasive use of NGFWs. (Clarification. 02Nov2010. NSS Labs tests security products, including firewalls,Â  and publishes the results.)By Avishai WoolThe last few years have brought us arguably the most significant change in firewall technology in decades. Ever since â€œStateful Inspectionâ€ was introduced by Check Point in the late 1990â€™s, firewall administrators and information security officers have been defining security policies based primarily on a connectionâ€™s source IP address, destination IP address, and service.Now, with the so called â€œNext Generationâ€ firewalls (NGFWs) promoted by Palo Alto Networks and Check Point R75, policy can also be defined based on the â€œapplicationâ€.To understand why this technical detail is an exciting development for organizations, we need a bit of background. Almost all organizations let their users browse the net. From a firewall point of view, this policy is implemented by allowing the â€œhttpâ€ service (technically, tcp on port 80) from the internal net, to anywhere.The trouble is that application programmers have realized this policy, and have adjusted: Almost every web-application now communicates over tcp/80. Since this port is practically certain to be open, there is no need for the application users to ask for a new rule through the firewall; the application will â€œjust workâ€. This is very convenient for application developers, and also for application users.But it is a serious concern for information security officers, because not all … more"

This is something that we’re going to have to address. As the presidential election unfolded in the fall, for example, there were revelations about how mobile apps used by political candidates were rife with security flaws that played right into the hands of propagandists and conspiracy theorists.Data Theorem, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based software security vendor specializing in API exposures, took a close look at the gaping vulnerabilities in mobile app used by the Biden and Trump campaigns, respectively, and came up with a scoring system to rate the security-level of each camp’s main mobile app to reach voters.On Android, the Official Trump 2020 App ranked nearly three times as secure as the Vote Joe App, for a simplistic reason: the Trump app used the most recent version of Android OS. Newer versions of Android provided more security and privacy benefits.That said, neither the Biden nor the Trump apps enforced Android’s Verify Apps feature, which scans for potentially harmful Apps on the device. If the Verify Apps feature is turned off, any apps side-loaded onto the user’s device do not get scanned for malware, Doug Dooley, Data Theorem’s chief operating officer, told me."

You believe you’ve followed all the steps and your app is ready to go, right?Wrong. You have one more step in the security process before you can give the green light: a secure code review.Related podcast: How application security testing can dovetail into ‘DevOps’If you’re wondering what a secure code review is, it’s the process organizations go through to identify and fix potentially risky security vulnerabilities in the late and final stages of development. They serve as a final step to ensure your code is safe and that all the dependencies and controls of the application are secured and functional. Here are six fundamentals to onboarding secure software.Run through a checklist. This may seem obvious, but keeping the review process consistent is extremely important. When conducting manual code reviews, make sure all reviewers are working off of the same comprehensive checklist. Enforce time constraints as well as mandatory breaks for manual code reviewers. It’s important to ensure the reviewers are at their sharpest, especially when looking at high-value applications.Keep things positive. It’s easy to single out developers for mistakes. However, if you want to build a positive security culture, it’s important to refrain from playing the blame game; this only serves to deepen the gap between security and development. Use your findings to help guide your security education and awareness programs, using mistakes as a jumping off point to spotlight what developers should be looking out for.Rely on a mix of humans and tools. Tools aren’t armed with the mind of a human, and therefore can’t detect issues in the logic of code and the risk to the organization if such a flaw is left unfixed.

AcohidoSo you don’t mind paying for the latest, greatest mobile device and dedicating it to both home and work tasks. Join the crowd.BYOD — Bring Your Own Device to work — is a trend that’s been on the rise for a few years. Companies save costs, employees enjoy greater flexibility, and both reap productivity gains.Companies in 2012 generally conceded that BYOD is unstoppable. That said, workers who opt to join the BYOD craze this year won’t have the same free-wheeling experiences that characterized the trend in its earlier stages.This year, BYOD participants can expect to relinquish control of their devices — and forgo a level of privacy — as companies impose much tighter security constraints, mobile industry analysts say.“If workers want more BYOD, they will need to give up something in return,” says Jack Gold, researcher at J. Gold Associates. “That’s the ability for enterprises to enact policies and control their access and actions.”As the BYOD craze heated up in 2012, tensions mounted. Information-technology departments used to micromanaging the use of company-supplied equipment discovered that locking down employee-owned devices — without stifling new-found productivity gains — was anything but simple.In response, a new category of tech systems, referred to as mobile-device management, or MDM, tools and services, took root. “Organizations will continue to grapple with BYOD security and usage issues in 2013,” predicts Christian Kane, enterprise-mobility analyst at research firm Forrester.Mixed taskingThe beginnings of BYOD trace back a few years, when consumers first began gobbling up cool new social-networking, gaming and mapping apps delivered via state-of-the-art mobile devices.Initially, workers looking for an edge began to tap hot new consumer apps for work-related networking and collaborating on iPads, iPhones and Android smartphones.

Large enterprises have legal staffs to pay attention to this. But many small and medium sized businesses don’t have that luxury.  In this guest commentary, Ethan Miller, an insurance attorney at Hogan Lovells describes new cyber liability policies available to small businesses concerned about data thieves.)By Ethan A. MillerIt seems to be that large cyber attacks against big corporations get the most media coverage. The costs of investigating and responding, and the resulting lawsuits and regulatory fines, can be staggering. The Ponemon Institute has estimated that response costs can be as high as $200 for each compromised record. It is not difficult to understand how total costs for a wide breach can quickly escalate well into the millions of dollars.But smaller companies also face such losses. When these losses arise, the best friend a small company can have is a well-crafted cyber liability insurance policy. And, cyber liability insurance is often more appropriate for smaller businesses.Large companies typically have the foresight and ability to manage cyber risk up front and the sophistication to deal with losses. For smaller businesses, this is not always so.While cyber policies reimburse a business for the damages it must pay its customers, they do much more. A victim of a cyber loss must first investigate the cause, often with the use of IT forensic examiners. The company must then comply with required notices to potentially affected customers.And of course once word is out about the loss, the victim must manage the negative media attention. Cyber insurance can defray expenses at each of these stages. For instance, cyber insurance may pay the costs of hiring a public relations firm to mitigate negative publicity following a breach.Such insurance can also pay to retain … more"

I view it as a call to action, more than past administrations have done. This alone makes it worthwhile.But it’s just a start. Much  more needs to be done, and whether this materializes is anybody’s guess. Take, for example, the goal of improved protection of U.S. infrastructure. The administration must respond decisively to the fact that our electric grid and other key components of national infrastructure were designed to be functional, not secure.Related article: Obama uses bully pulpit to encourage public-private intel sharingI don’t know what the administration will do to fix this, but I recommend a three-pronged strategy. First, the government should define a level of expected cyber resiliency and produce a methodology to protect it.  Second, we should create a clearing center for the implementation of best practices in grid security.  And third, we should form an industrial bank to provide long-term financing to utilities that need it in order to help implement this.Here is my take on other key measures that must be taken to improve government cybersecurity. The first is addressed in Trump’s EO; the others are insufficiently addressed or not at all.–Intel sharing. The EO’s call for federal government agencies – especially civilian agencies – to seek opportunities to share cyber technology is a good move.It is unwise to reinvent the wheel, one government silo at a time. And cloud-based computing and security frameworks available today make a holistic approach realistic. Data security frameworks would then be layered atop the cloud framework so that data can be shared while also encrypted. Individual agencies could then build on this framework for their unique needs.

However, Jonathan Mayer, the Stanford University doctorate and law student, whose research the Federal Trade Commission reviewed in suggesting a Congressional mandate may be necessary to make Do Not Track a reality, says those fears are unfounded. In this Technology Live interview, Mayer explains how Do Not Track works — and outlines what kind of snooping technology it can stop, if enforced.LW: What got you involved in Do Not Track? Mayer: My colleague, Arvind Narayanan, and I got interested in Do Not Track because we saw this proliferation of online tracking by behavioral advertising networks and other tracking services. We wanted to examine what consumers could do to regain control of some of their privacy online. Our aim is to be a technology honest broker, in this debate, and show what we believe is a viable technological approach. LW: So this technology works in the web browser I happen to be using, right? Mayer: Yes, it’s fairly straightforward. Our aim was to make this completely transparent to the user. The user flips one Do Not Track switch, and it ads a little bit of information, that all of the advertising networks and tracking services can see, saying ‘don’t track me, please.’LW: Is it technically difficult for the ad networks and tracking service to honor my request? Mayer. Not at all. It varies by platform, but … more"

Ed Markey, D- Mass., and Joe Barton, R-Tex., in calling on the Federal Trade Commission to launch a formal investigation of Facebook’s practice of collecting and using data about its users Internet activities.This morning the groups sent this letter to the FTC. Markey and Barton sent this letter earlier this week.At issue is Facebook’s alleged practice of using it’s Like button, and other mechanisms, integrated into partner Web pages all across the Web, to track its members Web surfing patterns and preferences for news, entertainment and personal topics.Privacy concerns heightened last week after Facebook launched new features that incorporate such tracking data. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg kicked off the annual f8 developers conference in San Francisco last week by introducing “Timeline” pages that digitally maps everything a user has ever done on the popular social network.And ZuckerBerg also unveiled a new class of “Open Graph”applications designed to broadcast user’s surfing patterns and interests to friends and friends of friends all across Facebook’s user base of 800 million members around the world.Users have long been able to share information, manually. But the new services automate much of the sharing process, and appear to tap deeper into user data amassed by the company, says Chris Calabrese, legal counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.“There’s a loss of user control, here,” Calabrese says. “Combined with the permanent nature of the information, it means there is a lack of the ability for consumers to control and protect their online reputations.”“The new ‘Frictionless Sharing’ features are just more examples of Facebook disregarding the privacy of its users by making sweeping changes that expose personal … more"

And now small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are being increasingly targeted — especially companies  rushing to tap into cloud services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.To help you unpack all of this, here are five fundamental concepts that will help you understand why you should reduce  your exposure to illicit cryptocurrency mining.•Cryptocurrency basics. Bitcoin gets created by solving an increasingly difficult math problem; the difficulty factor has risen to the point where Bitcoin today can only be mined by special-purpose computers that consume massive amounts of electricity.However, Monero, Ethereum, Bytecoin and other cryptocurrencies have come along that can still be mined by ordinary computing devices. So naturally, cryptocurrency mining services have cropped up. Coinhive is a notable example."

But the cybercriminals responsible for the latest variant of Koobface have come up with a new slant that demonstrates how clever the bad guys have become at blending and scaling up tried-and-true attack techniques.This particular variant of the Koobface worm  — dubbed Koobface.GK — initiates by posting malicious links on Facebook wall pages enticing folks to click on a cutesy Christmas video.Attempts to play the video turns over control of the PC to the attacker, says PandaLabs researcher Sean-Paul Correll. The victim next sees a Windows warning message requiring them to solve a CAPTCHA puzzle within three minutes.If you see this screen, you must solve the puzzle to regain control of your PC. A timer ticks down. If the puzzle goes unsolved after three minutes, the PC freezes up. Rebooting won’t help. The CAPTCHA puzzle will reappear. The only way to end the loop is to solve the CAPTCHA. The victim can then use his or her machine as normal. But the attacker still has control.While this ruse is unfolding, the worm separately uses the victim’s machine to fill out a new account application. This goes on unseen by the victim. Solving the CAPTCHA is the final step in creating a new Facebook account. The new account is then used to post more tainted Christmas links. And the cycle repeats.Trailblazing new way to create shell accountsThese bad guys have thus pioneered a cheaper, faster way to create shell Facebook accounts for nefarious purposes. This is a much more robust method than recruiting CAPTCHA-resolvers and paying them a few pennies to resolve new account application CAPTCHAs in real time, as LastWatchdog disclosed in this investigative story.

Remember when infectious banner ads and viral toolbars cluttered early browsers?Related: Web application exposures redoubleHistorically, with each iteration of malicious ads, the online advertising industry, led by Google, has fought back, and kept this scourge at a publicly acceptable level.However, malvertising has never been as dynamic, stealthy and persistent as it is today. Here’s what you should know about this enduring online threat:Gaming the ecosystemMalvertising has become enmeshed in the highly dynamic online advertising, shopping and banking ecosystem we’ve come to rely on. It has accomplished this by leveraging the openness of the browsers on our go-to computing devices, namely our smartphones and PCs.Malvertising code often circulates in tiny iframes, the HTML element that enables objects to appear on a webpage without changing the page. This bad code comes and goes, circulating to even well-known, high-traffic websites as part of the flow of web ads being placed dynamically by the online advertising networks, of which Google is the largest.Malvertisers game this ecosystem in several ways. There are endless ways for them to hack into websites and ad networks directly. Doors and windows are left wide open in the software applications being rapidly developed to support a swelling army of third-party contractors who supply shopping cart services, data management platforms, retargeting enablement systems, and the like.“The bad guys are insinuating their malicious code as part of the code that renders on the victim’s device during fulfillment,” says Chris Olson, CEO of the Media Trust, a McLean, VA-based website security vendor. “If you visit a large retail website, you may encounter 100 or 150 third party companies that get access to your computing device.

That’s a record high since 2003 when the firm first began tracking identity theft and fraud.Related article: How a 19-year-old ran a bogus credit card empireThe retail and the financial services industry have put great effort and resources into stopping identity theft crimes. However, the complexity of fraud continues to rise, and there has been a shift towards other prevalent types of identity fraud taking place online, such as identity theft and new account fraud.Javelin’s findings tell us that with the adoption of embedded chip cards now widespread in the U.S., criminals have begun to shift their fraud operations away from physical stores, favoring online transactions, new account fraud, and identity theft. While credit card information remained the most targeted for new account fraud, there has been significant growth in the opening of new intermediary accounts. Payment services are increasingly being targeted by fraudsters.For the first time ever, Social Security numbers (35%) were compromised more often in breaches than credit card numbers (30%). These trends demonstrate that personal information is under siege, and protecting sensitive data with legacy methods is futile in the age of mega breaches."

The reality is much more nuanced.In some ways, Google is not doing anything differently than other Internet media giants. In one sense, it’s playing catch-up with Facebook. It’s attempting to accelerate its ad revenue by leveraging your personal data to help its advertisers target consumers more effectively.That data is quite valuable and something we often give up – to varying degrees – when we use “free” services like Gmail, Google +, or any number of no-cost applications.You may be perfectly okay with that – which is great. Or you may be absolutely, unequivocally opposed to it. The point is that everyone has a different level of tolerance and comfort when it comes to personal disclosure. Some prefer to hold the reins of privacy quite taut. Others may take great satisfaction in becoming a micro-celebrity in a new endorsement economy, touting expertise in areas they’re uniquely qualified to promote. Call it your fifteen minutes of Internet fame.The tricky part comes with really understanding just what could be revealed about you.

But disparities between operational and board level attitudes to cloud adoption could prolong this decision and heighten the cyber security threat.Frontline operational staff and the boardroom have their eyes on different prizes. Board level decision makers tend to set objectives based on business agility. Operational teams are more interested in cost-efficiency. IT teams are focused on bulletproof security. A recent global survey conducted by NTT Com Security revealed disparities prior to cloud adoption hindering business and extending vulnerabilities.In security, as in business generally, there are tradeoffs. Without aligning security objectives to broad business objectives, valuable resources are expended unnecessarily and systems are inevitably left vulnerable to external threats. Moving to the cloud to save money without properly considering security implications could result in greater losses in the event of a breach. Chris Camejo, director, NTT Com Security(Photo: Greg Nesbit)On the other hand, going overboard with security may have an adverse impact on business productivity and also end up outweighing potential savings. The right approach is to consider the sensitivity of data moved into the cloud along with the potential threats to this information. Management and IT must come together to make objective decisions about how much security is appropriate to protect the business without sacrificing productivity.Although cloud technology is still maturing, attitudes from the board to the front-line become more productive in every aspect when a cohesive organization has evaluated the benefits of private, public or hybrid cloud deployment together.

While Microsoft has made great strides in security, the decision to add gradations to the User Account Control mechanism in Windows 7 — and set the default setting at medium -high — once again lays bare the company’s engrained features bias.“Overall Windows 7 is a big improvement and a much more secure operating system,” says Eric Voskuil, CTO of security firm BeyondTrust. “However, UAC in its default configuration is a ticking time bomb.”UAC is the feature introduced in Vista that finally made a distinction between user-level access, needed to open files and work with data, and administrator-level access, needed to install new applications on your harddrive. From a security standpoint, user-level control is restricted, and, therefore, good;  while administrator-level access is wide open and thus can be very, very bad.User-level vs. administrator-level accessIn Windows XP, administrator-level access was enabled by default, a big reason cybercriminals have been able to install malicious applications on tens of millions of Internet-connected Windows PCs  and amass them into botnets to carry out Internet-enabled criminal activities.Microsoft designed UAC to put users in control of when to grant administrator-level access to the harddrive.

One such popular way to infiltrate a system is Pharming. It is an online scam attack quite similar to Phishing.Related: Credential stuffing explainedThe term Pharming is a combination of two words Phishing and Farming. It is a type of social engineering cyberattack in which the website’s traffic is manipulated to steal confidential credentials from the users. Cybercriminals design a fake website, basically the clone of an official one, and use various means to redirect users to the phony webpage when visiting any other legit site.Primarily the Pharming attack is planned to gain sensitive data like login credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), social security numbers, bank details, and more. The attackers can also use it for installing malware programs on the victim’s system.Pharming vs phishingThough Pharming and Phishing share almost similar goals, the approach to conduct Pharming is entirely different from Phishing. Unlike Phishing, Pharming is more focused on sabotaging the system rather than manipulating the victims. However, we will later know how Phishing plays a vital role in conducting Pharming.The Pharming attacks are carried out by modifying the settings on the victim’s system or compromising the DNS server. Manipulating the Domain Name Service (DNS) protocol and rerouting the victim from its intended web address to the fake web address can be done in the following two ways:•Changing the Local Host file. In this method of manipulating DNS, the attackers infiltrate the victim’s device and change the local host file. A local host file is a directory of IP addresses. The modified local host file would redirect users to the fake website whenever they try to open the legit site the next time. The phony website is designed similar to the one victims intended to visit so that the users are not alarmed.To modify the local host file, the attacker primarily uses the Phishing technique so … more"

So those used in manufacturing plants, utility plants and transportation systems remain a huge security challenge. The rising dominance of cloud computing and mobile devices to run modern-day networks has exposed ICS controls, in particular, to threat actors.Boeing, for instance, found it challenging to assure security of its industrial controls while also maintaining a high pace of jetliner production. “They had to find a way to identify and separate systems from each other,” Kaplan says. The solution came in the form of an innovative protocol—called HIP, host identity protocol—developed by Ericsson and sponsored by Boeing and the U.S. Navy.Stability and security“Essentially, it’s an overlay, so an environment can keep running the systems it ran before,” he says. It’s an identity-based network, an architecture that “rides above” an established system, without changing fundamental system attributes.It was an important breakthrough, since most industries are reluctant to make wholesale changes to legacy systems that are working. In today’s banking sector, for example, “these systems run very old code, and for good reason,” Kaplan says. “They’re very stable; the upgrading is a high risk.“When you’re running an electric grid, turning the grid off is not an option, so these systems couldn’t protect themselves,” he says.

On the other side of the coin, deception in an offensive mode also can be part of the tradecraft of nation-states and cyber criminals, too.Why discuss these aspects now? With the world’s cybersecurity professionals focused on responding to ransomware attacks, chasing the next worm, patching servers, or running after users clicking on phishing emails that change their Google Drive settings, one must ask the question: Are at least some of these attacks cover for or distractions for more nefarious cyber attacks?Related article: Petya signifies arrival of more sophisticated malwareIf the NotPetya outbreak was truly meant to derive profit from ransomware payments, then it is unlikely to achieve its full objective.If, however, the NotPetya outbreak was meant to further probe companies that have not patched the SMB vulnerability and/or exploit these systems with a targeted zero-day attack and slide in under the radar, then the art of misdirection may have been achieved.Much like past data breaches that have used a DDoS attack to overwhelm and distract the company’s resources, getting teams of cybersecurity professionals to run around in response to the nightly news is one potential strategy that might work.Military modelIt is not only attackers that use these techniques though. Militaries around the world have used deception and misdirection on the battlefield to influence, confuse, lie to, or cause specific reactions from their adversary.Electronic warfare commands have fought misdirection campaigns for many decades and in cyber space as well. Whether it is blinding an enemy’s radar and overwhelming the radar technician with too many targets or sending up false sorties that look like they are going to … more"

The Cambridge, Mass.-based start up helps companies comply deal with data privacy and data loss disclosure regulations. Schneier shared what’s top of his mind with CyberTruth.CT: You started in encryption, and had a great run as a globe trotting cybersecurity guru. What got you interested in doing hands-on vendor work again?Schneier: Who says I can’t do it all? After seven years at British Telcom, I was itching to join a start-up again. I have been involved with Co3 Systems for about a year, first as an informal advisor and then on their Technical Advisory Board. All of what I do and write about it predicated on real-world problems and solutions, and it will be good to get up close to actual corporate security customers again. But I have no plans on stopping any of my other writing or speaking projects.CyberTruth video: How Co3 Systems manages privacy, data loss regsCT: Vendors bearing systems to detect, stop and investigate APTs are getting a ton of attention; Co3 Systems is coming at the problem from another angle. What piqued your curiosity most about Co3’s business model?Schneier: For a couple of decades I’ve been talking about three parts to security: protection, detection, and response. Response is most neglected of the three, and that’s where Co3 Systems sits. It’s the only product that does incident-responses coordination, which is important right now for two reasons. One, attacks have gotten more sophisticated, which means response has to be similarly sophisticated. And two, the regulatory environment has gotten more complicated, which means response has to be more regimented and documented. One of the real problems with any emergency response system is that it is only used in an emergency, which means that it’s real easy … more"

And you can be sure that Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Apple will lead the way in sharpening industry protocals to head off any new regulations."

There is a growing recognition of the sprawling exposures that are being shaped as companies increasingly outsource mission-critical IT functions to third parties – suppliers, contractors, hosted services and the like that require network access.Some 75% of the IT professionals recently surveyed by the Ponemon Institute acknowledged that the risk of a breach from a third part is serious and increasing. And another survey of senior executives by Soha System’s Third Party Advisory Group linked 63% of all data breaches directly or indirectly to access granted suppliers and contractors.I recently chatted at length with Brad Keller, Prevalent’s Senior Director of Third Party Strategy, about how regulators are moving to light a fire under companies to address third-party risk. We discussed how Prevalent and other security vendors have begun delivering innovative systems to help companies efficiently assess – and continually monitor — third-party risks.One question Keller told me he gets consistently from CISOs at companies of all sizes is: ‘Where do we begin?”  We discussed three fundamental steps for addressing third-party risk:Know your vendorsStart by compiling a complete and accurate list of all the vendors your company deals with and the specific services each provides.“I continue to be amazed, in this day and age, how many companies cannot provide such a list,” Keller says. “They just have not done it. I’ll go in and say, ‘Who are all your vendors?’ And someone will say, ‘I don’t know. I guess there’s a list somewhere in procurement.’”Any organization should be able to do this first step.

1641448489-841,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/80,GUEST ESSAY: Why breach response drills have a place in network security,"By Phil SusmanIt’s no secret that cybersecurity has become a more pressing issue over the past decade. According to a PWC Global State of the Information Security Survey in 2015, the number of cybersecurity incidents has increased at an annual rate of 66 percent. Both the range and complexity of cyber threats are expanding—from ransomware to compromises of critical infrastructure.Yet, when those threats materialize, too few businesses and government entities have developed the protocols needed to escalate resources, coordinate support, and respond to an attack. While the need for these strategies has spanned more than a decade, it is even more imperative now as we confront a growing array of threats.Ten years ago, Norwich University Applied Research Institutes (NUARI) launched the DECIDE Platform, with support from the Department of Homeland Security, to challenge leadership to engage across their organizations and respond to crippling cyber attacks. It is critical that the entire firm be prepared to respond in the event of a cyber breach.Related story: Security awareness training is becoming a vital security toolWhile DECIDE was initially developed to engage the financial markets and support critical infrastructure, the platform has migrated to engage leadership across continents, supporting their teams’ and individuals’ cyber preparedness. To do this, DECIDE offers a wide array of cutting-edge threat scenarios, ensuring entities can test their decision-making capabilities and enhance strategic communications. Organizations can develop comprehensive response plans that address previous vulnerabilities head-on.Simulation pays offWhen a cyber threat hits, there is no time to lose. Firms must take proactive opportunities to identify the gaps and needs that otherwise lead to business disaster. DECIDE offers firms the chance to simulate a particular scenario time and again to ensure they make the right decisions in the heat of the moment.However, that is not enough.

1641448330-532,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/125,Why privileged accounts are master keys coveted by hackers,"By Byron V. AcohidoSEATTLE – One big reason cyberintruders can easily roam far and wide, once they crack inside a company network, is that many organizations pay scant heed to privileged accounts.Privileged accounts are the logons that give administrative access to any device with a microprocessor, including PCs, servers, databases and copiers.They function, in effect, as master keys to the deepest, most sensitive parts of an organization’s digital assets.A recent survey by Cyber-Ark Software found that 86% of large enterprise organizations either do not know or underestimate the number of privileged accounts incorporated into their networks.However,the bad guys certainly have a good sense of where to look for privileged accounts — and how to take advantage of them.“Hackers know that these things are built into the infrastructure and are everywhere and that organizations fail to secure them,” says Udi Mokady, CEO of Cyber-Ark. “It’s a major, and easy, attack vector.”Cyber-Ark determined that the number of privileged accounts in an organization is typically three to four times the number of employees.Often passwords to these accounts are widely shared and changed infrequently. Roughly half of the responding organizations in Cyber-Ark’s survey admitted to sharing passwords to privileged accounts among “approved” users.Larger enterprises shared privileged account passwords 56% of the time, while smaller companies shared passwords 47% of the time.Organizations large and small can shore up defenses by identifying here privileged accounts exist, monitoring them and implementing strong password policies.“You need to make sure the only way to access privileged accounts is through very stringent security layers,” says Mokady."

Here are four simple things you should be doing: Update. Update. Update. Make sure that you’re running up to date software. Old software makes it easy for bad guys to compromise you by using widely available exploits.  Control access. Make sure you know who has access to your servers, and that only those people are accessing your servers.  Test apps.  If you’re running custom application code on your servers, make sure you’ve had it tested for the Top 10 security issues in web applications.  Be watchful. Keep a close eye on your server and the bill from your cloud provider. An unexpected spike in traffic will help alert you that your simple webserver has been turned into a costly spam zombie.Big breaches have made cyber-security a top of mind issue for just about everybody these days. However, many business owners and consumers are unwitting accomplices to cybercrime.Their unknowing participation can range from relaying spam, to performing distributed denial of service attacks and even relaying directed attacks against high value targets.End users know that they are ultimately responsible for keeping themselves safe online, and they spend freely on anti-virus and anti-malware solutions for their desktops, laptops and even mobile devices.

The researcher described how invoking a Flash video clip playback in Flash Player, under certain parameters, caused his Web browser to crash.In more innocent times, this would’ve been a normal beta testing scenario: user reports glitch in a cool new feature; vendor updates. But in today’s world of teeming cybercrime, one man’s glitch is another man’s exploitable zero-day flaw.While BIMS helps Adobe keep an open dialogue with users, the web site also “gives cyber criminals a convenient place to look for vulnerabilities they can exploit,” says Purewire researcher Paul Royal. “Here you can find bugs that cause crashes, and any bug that can cause a crash can potentially also be used to execute code arbitrarily.”Executives targetedSure enough, on July 9, 2009 reports began to filter into a handful of security companies from corporate clients, says Royal.

But fresh research findings from firewall vendor Palo Alto Networks revealing that the vast majority of malware seeping into company networks arrives via drive-by download.It turns out that the biggest threat to corporate networks is employees unwitting clicking on webpages carrying nasty infections, such as widely-used Blackhole programs designed to intelligently fingerprint your computing device and locate the best available security hole to infect it.Palo Alto’s discovery finding suggests that the bad guys have shifted their attention to corrupting vulnerable webservers, and thus booby-trapping innocuous web sites to silently infect the computer or mobile device of any and all visitors.(Dot connection: Palo Alto’s research dovetails with findings by security firms ESET and Sucuri, disclosing details of a nasty bit of malware dubbed, Linux/Cdorked.A. As CyberTruth reported earlier this week, Linux/Cdorked.A has stealthily implanted driveby download infections in hundreds of Apache webservers, the most well-known and widely-used webserver in the world.)Palo Alto analyzed three months worth of Internet traffic circulating through its customers’ networks, and found that 90% of the malware leaked in from web-browsing, while only 6% arrived via tainted e-mails.Malware circulated via driveby download, via a tainted webpage, also did a much more effect job of remaining undetected. On average it took 20 days or longer for antivirus programs to detect and block malware from a web borne compromise versus five days for email-based malware.The simple reasons for this, says Palo Alto product manager Wade Williamson, is that web-browsing is real-time and email is not.

AcohidoA spambot, referred to as Onliner, has been discovered delivering a malicious banking Trojan. What’s worse, the spammers behind Onliner inadvertently exposed some 711 million email addresses held in their possession.Some context is needed to grasp the significance of this. Consider that spambots have been around for a long time. For the most part, garden-variety spambots are a huge nuisance, designed to carry out a two-stage mission. First, a spambot crawls the internet seeking out email addresses from websites, news group postings and chat-room conversations, and from this crawling activity it compiles a gargantuan mailing list. Next, a spambot blasts out email pitches for all manner of sketchy products and services.Related video: Scammers take advantage of trust in Gmail, Google DriveOnliner happens to be an especially pernicious spambot. It is designed to bypass many types of spam filters, and it delivers messages carrying corrupted attachments, such as invoices from government bodies, hotel reservation details, and DHL notifications. By clicking on one of these attachments, the recipient installs the Ursnif banking Trojan. Ursnif very swiftly steals account logons, credit card details, and other personal information.It turns out that the spammers operating Onliner neglected to lock down one of their servers, allowing anyone to see and download a master mailing list of 711 million email addresses.

But   security experts at the time didn’t express much concern. Early ConfickerÃ‚Â  exploits were circulating in the wild, but only sporadically. Corporations likewise were nonplussed; many took their sweet time installing the RPC-DCOM patch.Accelerating the discussionFast forward to the present.  LastWatchdog has stepped forward to accelerate the discussion about this latest Windows zero-day flaw. I’ve spent the day polling  eight top security analysts and researchers about how the RPC-DCOM flaw  was handled, and how the SMB2 flaw is being handled.Let’s put aside the side-show of whether grey-hat researcher Laurent Gaffie disclosed the flaw responsibly or not. Microsoft says he was irresponsible; Garrie contends in this Security Focus interview that he was upholding tenets of full disclosure.Consider that at its peak last January, Conficker searched out and infected some 10 million Windows XP machines worldwide.

In this LastWatchdog guest post, Michael Maloof,  chief technology officer at  TriGeo Network Security, examines the ramification of insider data leaks, brought to light by Assange. TriGeo  provides Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technology.By Michael MaloofThe whistle-blowing Web site WikiLeaks recently published nearly 400,000 classified Iraq War documents containing incredibly sensitive information, including details on casualties, detainee abuse and the involvement of Iran. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possibly the largest classified data breach ever, and clearly demonstrates that the biggest threats to an organization are employees on the inside.Illegitimate use of legitimate access is one of the most difficult things to identify and prevent; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also absolutely critical to an effective information security strategy.  Insiders know exactly what’s valuable, where it’s located, and how to get it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arming them with everything they need to do serious damage in a matter of minutes.So how do organizations strike the right balance between granting employees necessary access and preventing malice and misuse?  Forrester has some interesting ideas in its Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zero Trust Model of Information Security.Ã¢â‚¬ÂBut for businesses that need to trust employees in order to operate, there are countermeasures that can be applied to red-flag illicit activity and stop potential insider abuse: activity monitoring, event correlation and behavioral analysis.  Together, these information security essentials quickly determine whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“business as usualÃ¢â‚¬Â and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“out of the ordinary.Ã¢â‚¬ÂCountrywide Financial is the perfect poster child.

But the company’s PR agency contacted all the publications that ran with McAfee’s initial, alarming, survey results.Cyberattacks are real and pose tangible risks to consumers and businesses. And public awareness is not what it should be. McAfee is not alone when it comes to competitive vendors walking — and sometimes stepping over – the thin line between building public awareness and fear mongering to gin up sales.

AcohidoOver the past 10 years or so, machine learning has come to dominate our digital lives.Commercial entities crunch mountains of data, leveraging “intelligent” mathematical algorithms at a furious pace. Much of this is done as part of the massively profitable endeavor of shaping consumer preferences and behaviors—to a degree unimagined by the best-and-brightest sci-fi authors of just 70 or 80 years ago.So it’s about time the cybersecurity industry has joined the party. Indeed, a cottage industry is thriving composed of information security companies that are increasingly leveraging machine learning—even featuring it—in network defense systems.Related article: Machine learning keeps malware from getting in through security cracksA startup called FFRI, and its intriguing founder and CEO, Yuji Ukai, is a new entrant in this field. FFRI happens to be one of the standouts in the emerging cybersecurity industry in Japan. Ukai arrived at Black Hat Vegas this summer hoping to make a splash with a new anti-malware product, which he refers to as the “Yarai,” developed in the land of the rising sun.A new tackInstead of amassing and continually expanding a blacklist of known malware and past-attack patterns, as legacy antivirus suites do, the Yarai uses machine learning to detect intrusions by malware for which there are no known signatures or patterns.Stopping malicious code known as “fileless” malware, or “non-malware,” is a fast emerging specialty. Fileless malware attacks have no signatures, per se. Instead, they cleverly tap into and make use of existing, authorized applications that exist on the company network. So there is no need to download any malicious files.Ukai, a systems engineer who got his career start at Kodak’s R&D office in Japan, spent four years at eEYE Digital Security in Orange County, California, during the go-go startup days of antivirus companies.

CSA executive director, Jim Reavis, penned this final draft for CyberTruth.)By Jim ReavisFor several years, it has seemed as though computers have played a role in virtually every part of our lives. However, we stand upon the precipice of a truly profound explosion in the growth of computing. From iPhones to tablets to self-driving cars (!) to the electrical grid, conservative projections peg the number of Internet-connected devices to rise from 8 billion today to over 100 billion by 2020Controlling these devices and managing our information are the massive server farms at Amazon, Google, Microsoft and elsewhere, creating a global compute utility called cloud computing, or more simply, the Cloud, which is expanding at a similar pace. It is impossible to predict all of the good and bad that will result from this massive growth, but it is possible to orient ourselves around a technology-friendly, global point of view to manage the problems as they emerge.Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), an international not-for-profit organization with over 44,000 members, is building an ecosystem to create trust and confidence in the cloud based upon vendor-neutral best practices research conducted by a global constituency.Like a utility, the Cloud is always on and available.

But the volume and sophistication of such attacks accelerated in 2010, a trend that looks to intensify in 2011. “The good guys are slightly ahead,” says Craig Labovitz, chief scientist at network security firm Arbor Networks. “But it’s not clear this equilibrium will continue.”One major driver: More home PCs than ever have broadband connections capable of sending large streams of data to commercial websites. That’s made it easier for protest groups to rally like-minded cohorts to join in attacks.“It doesn’t take many computers any more to take down a website,” says Joel Parrish, Redspin application security engineer.Brand damageIn September, protesters used their home PCs to bombard the Motion Picture Association of America’s website, knocking it offline for 20 hours. The motive: payback for MPAA’s alleged efforts to shut down PirateBay.org, a popular site for downloading pirated music and movies.Home PCs were behind the December attacks that disrupted the websites of PayPal, Visa, MasterCard and PostFinance, a Swiss bank. Protesters sought to punish them for cutting off services to the WikiLeaks whistle-blower site.While such outages are temporary, “brand damage” can be lasting, says Danny McPherson, head of research at Internet infrastructure firm VeriSign.“When a site is knocked out, consumers simply go elsewhere to purchase goods and services, and they’ll stay with the vendor until that site becomes unavailable,” says McPhereson. “Losing customer trust can translate into lost revenue.”No industry estimates of such losses are available.Another … more"

USA TODAY, P1B, 5 Aug. 2011.LAS VEGAS â€” Millions of copiers and printers in thousands of companies worldwide are ripe targets for cyberthieves in the hunt for sensitive business documents.Researchers from Web security firm Zscaler ran a simple search and easily located 118,194 Hewlett-Packard printer-scanners, 9,431 Cannon photocopiers and 3,554 D-Link webcams equipped as Internet-connected Web servers.Any intruder could do the same thing, then take over control of devices protected by weak passwords, says Michael Sutton, Zscaler’s vice president of research. The intruder could then steal images of documents stored in a copier’s memory or take control of webcams placed inside a work area.“I’d be surprised if attackers weren’t already taking advantage,” says Sutton, who released the findings Thursday at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference here. “They’d be foolish not to. It’s just too easy.”Web server software today gets built into most printers, scanners, photocopiers, webcams, DVRs and other common workplace equipment. This is done to make it easy for technicians to troubleshoot the devices and change settings over the Internet.“It’s a much more convenient approach,” says Sutton. “The problem occurs when such servers are enabled by default and either not password protected or protected only by a common default password.”Yet, many companies aren’t bothering to lock down server software in commonplace office appliances. Zscaler also easily located 436,947 Cisco routers, switches and other networking appliances equipped as rudimentary Web servers.An intruder taking control of a Cisco device could monitor and even redirect network traffic, gaining prime position deep inside an organization’s network to steal authentication log-ons and proprietary documents.Much attention at the Black Hat conference here is being paid to escalating attacks to steal intellectual property.

With so much critical data now stored in the cloud, how can people protect their accounts?Related: Training human sensorsUntil biometrics or a quantum solution change our everyday approach to encryption, passwords remain our first line of defense against data breaches, hackers, and thieves.Guarding our digital lives (and real-world identities) with just a few keystrokes seems a tactic too simple to ignore, and if users are careful and stick with best practices, these simple measures can be remarkably effective.Proper password hygiene doesn’t require a degree in rocket science. Follow these four easy tips, and you’ll sleep better and safer at night.1) Create sufficiently-complex passwords. This may seem obvious, but most users have poor password habits because it’s far simpler to remember your pet’s name and birthday than a combination of random numbers and letters. But simpler passwords are much easier to hack. Anything quickly conceived can be deciphered with the same speed, so forget your old tricks and stick to these ground rules instead:•Longer is better. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) latest guidelines stress that a password’s length is its most critical component. Make sure your code has at least eight characters, but it’s best to pick a dozen or more.•Don’t use words or names. Words and phrases are easier to remember but highly susceptible to cracking. Hackers can run through entire dictionaries in seconds, making this approach similar to hiding a key under the doormat."

AcohidoWhat exactly constitutes cyberwarfare?The answer is not easy to pin down. On one hand, one could argue that cyber criminals are waging an increasingly debilitating economic war on consumers and businesses in the form of account hijacking, fraud, and extortion. Meanwhile, nation-states — the superpowers and second-tier nations alike — are hotly pursuing strategic advantage by stealing intellectual property, hacking into industrial controls, and dispersing political propaganda at an unheard-of scale.Related: Experts react to Biden’s cybersecurity executive orderNow comes a book by John Arquilla, titled Bitskrieg: The New Challenge of Cyberwarfare, that lays out who’s doing what, and why, in terms of malicious use of digital resources connected over the Internet. Arquilla is a distinguished professor of defense analysis at the United States Naval Postgraduate School. He coined the term ‘cyberwar,’ along with David Ronfeldt, over 20 years ago and is a leading expert on the threats posed by cyber technologies to national security.Bitskrieg gives substance to, and connects the dots between, a couple of assertions that have become axiomatic:•Military might no longer has primacy. It used to be the biggest, loudest weapons prevailed and prosperous nations waged military campaigns to achieve physically measurable gains. Today, tactical cyber strikes can come from a variety of operatives – and they may have mixed motives, only one of which happens to be helping a nation-state achieve a geo-political objective.•Information is weaponizable. This is truer today than ever before. Arquilla references nuanced milestones from World War II to make this point – and get you thinking. For instance, he points out how John Steinbeck used a work of fiction to help stir the resistance movement across Europe.Steinbeck’s imaginative novel, The Moon is Down, evocatively portrayed how ordinary Norwegians took extraordinary measures to disrupt Nazi occupation.

But some large organizations are starting to limit the damage they can do, once inside. And information about successful defense strategies are being more widely shared for the greater good.“If you stop the bad actor from taking action on his or her objective, you win,” says Steve Adegbite, director of cyber security at defense giant Lockheed Martin.Over the past 18 months, U.S. companies and agencies have more readily acknowledged that breaches are occurring daily and have moved to update systems for detecting persistent intruders and limiting the damage they can do, security experts say.The New York Times hired forensics firm Mandiant, which used military-style counter intelligence tactics to detect and cripple intruders, who appeared to be based in China. The paper then surprised many in the security community by sharing details of Mandiant’s findings.“It’s turning a page,” says Kurt Baumgartner, senior security analyst at Kaspersky Lab. “They immediately disclosed what the attackers were looking for, down to the reporters’ material the attackers were hunting.”A day after the Times ‘disclosure, the Wall Street Journal announced that it detected and blocked network intruders, also appearing to originate from China.

Scareware has become the scourge of the Internet.Find initial version of this article here.Those deceptive promotions crafted to panic you into spending $30 to $80 for worthless antivirus protection can hit you just about anywhere you turn on the Web. They arrive as booby-trapped Web links in e-mail and social network messages. They lurk hidden, and set to activate, when you click to popular, legitimate websites.BLOG: Twitter used to spread scarewareAnd now scareware purveyors are embedding triggers in places you wouldn’t expect: on advertisements displayed at mainstream media websites; amid search results from Google, Yahoo Search and Windows Live search; alongside comments posted on YouTube videos; and, most recently, in “tweets” circulating on Twitter.“Scareware is becoming a dominating force,” says Joe Stewart, director of SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit. “There are hundreds of criminals using every tactic they can think of to push these programs.”Click on a trigger and you’ll get caught in an unnerving loop impossible to abort. A scanner window will appear with red-letter warnings listing viruses purportedly infesting your hard drive. A series of dialogue boxes will follow giving you choices that all lead to the same screen: a sales pitch.Make the purchase, and you get a bogus inoculation. Try to cancel it, and you’ll get repeated offers. “It’s like stepping into quicksand,” says Paul Royal senior researcher at security firm Purewire. “The more you try to get out of it, the deeper you sink.”Scareware has been a prominent part of the Internet since 2004, when a cybergang based in St. Petersburg, Russia, launched the iframecash.biz website and began offering commissions to anyone who helped them spread the SpySheriff fake antivirus program. Hackers began to taint legitimate websites so that pop-up ads for SpySheriff would launch on the PC of anyone who visited a corrupted Web page.That simple arrangement has evolved into a steadily … more"

Another tried-and-true attack method, involves the involuntary use of thousands of infected home PCs, known as a botnet, under the control of a single bad guy controller. This is the method that if typically used to extort payments from gambling websites taken offline by a DDos attack just before a major sporting event.In the case of the … more"

Three days later, Eustace amended his stance.“A number of external regulators have inspected the data,” Eustace wrote in a Friday blog post. “It’s clear from those inspections that while most of the data is fragmentary, in some instances entire e-mails and URLs were captured, as well as passwords.”Eustace listed several privacy measures Google has recently implemented. “We are mortified by what happened,” he wrote, adding that Google would like to “delete this data as soon as possible.”Google spokeswoman Christine Chen says the company wants “to protect the privacy of those whose data we mistakenly collected.”Google already has deleted data harvested in Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Hong Kong, but has been unable to delete more because “many of the investigations are still ongoing,” Chen says.Privacy lawsuits … more"

F-Secure Chief Research Officer Mikko HyppÃƒÂ¶nen says no one in the security community has seen an actual copy of 09Droid’s first-of-its-kind banking app. So it could simply be a cheapo program, sold for 99 cents, that redirected users to the bank’s online bank website.On the other hand, 09Droid could have programmed in stealthy code to silently steal account logons. The point is, no one checked, and he did sell some number of apps prior to having Google yank them.HyppÃƒÂ¶nen notes that Android apps at present do not go through approval process, unlike apps available through the iPhone App Store or through Signed by Symbian programs.As a general rule of thumb he recommends avoiding any third party banking apps on any platform unless you know for certain it is expressly approved by your bank.To date F-Secure has not seen any malicious apps sold through iPhone App Store, Palm App Catalog, Ã‚Â BlackBerry App World or Windows Mobile Marketplace.

AcohidoAndy Ellis, Akamai’s CSO, is the designer and patent holder of Akamai’s SSL acceleration network. Last Watchdog asked him to put massive DDoS attacks into context.LW: What’s driving volumetric DDoS attacks?Ellis: I suspect that what we’re seeing is rapid explosion in capabilities driven not by “new” vulnerabilities, but by a critical mass of knowledge, combined with the widespread availability of both initiating botnets and reflection systems. Every network needs the DNS and NTP servers that provide reflection and amplification points; while the widespread availability of easily compromised servers in consumer cloud networks provides growing launch capabilities.We’ll see DDoS attacks like this continue to happen, likely with increasing regularity.  Criminal operators engaged in extortion have found that they can operationalize money-making campaigns; fraudsters seeking to cover their tracks with distraction-DDoS will continue to operate, and nation-backed adversaries will continue to use it as a weapon of economic warfare.LW: What can or should be done?Ellis: Besides buy amazing DDoS defense services?  Fundamentally, we have a public health issue on the Internet: Compromisable systems can forge packets at open reflectors.   That’s three capabilities an adversary needs to exploit; limiting any one of them is beneficial.  All ISPs should be implementing BCP38, or egress filtering, and not allowing traffic to originate from their network that doesn’t come from a net block they know about.  Organizations operating reflectable services should be controlling access to those systems, and rate-limiting outbound responses.  And, of course, people should be maintaining their systems.LW: Anything else?Ellis: While these attacks seem large, fundamentally these are the easy attacks.   We’re already seeing attacks that aren’t merely bandwidth-based.  They’re smaller, but they look more like end-users to most defenses, and those can be problematic for the unprepared to defend themselves against."

This simply means that they trust, but don’t often verify, that their partners are reputable and stay compliant over time. Given the dynamic nature of websites today and the constantly changing integrations to a site, this implicit trust model no longer suffices.So what does the average modern website look like? More than 70 percent of the content that loads on an end user’s browser does not come from the website’s server at all. Enterprises are designing client heavy applications that are executed through JavaScript at runtime, and these browsers are acting as modern day OSes.Let’s discuss how the SolarWinds hack relates to a regular website supply chain. Web architecture from the past decade followed a trend where most web applications were server heavy, and enterprises’ data centers handled the bulk of the processing. The web browser was more of a graphical interface or a rendering engine.Due to optimized speeds and improved computing capacity on client devices, the architecture has evolved over the last few years."

With many employees now working remotely, securing company data isn’t as straightforward as it used to be. Things get even more complicated if you have an international remote workforce.Related: Employees as human sensorsAs of 2018, more than 2 million people were working abroad for U.S. companies in China alone. Since then, as remote work has become more popular and accessible, that figure has likely only increased. International workforces can be an excellent way to find top talent, but they can introduce unique security risks.Here are five unique cybersecurity challenges you should know about.•Inconsistent data regulations. Countries have different data security laws, and these can get in the way of one another. For example, suppose you have workers in the EU. In that case, you must abide by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes fines on some activities that are perfectly legal in the U.S.Having workers in multiple countries with laws like this introduces further complications. For instance, if you have employees in China and the EU, you’ll have to obtain Chinese government approval to provide data from China to EU authorities enforcing the GDPR. These conflicts and inconsistencies can make it hard to create a cybersecurity program that abides by all relevant laws."

It was prompted by Congress’ failure to pass cybersecurity laws that would compel companies to share information about cyberattacks with federal authorities.“After the failure of comprehensive cybersecurity legislation last year, the need for immediate executive action was clearly apparent, and I applaud the President for taking on this difficult task,” says Rep. Jim Langevin, D-RI.Obama assigned the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to lead development of a framework for voluntary information sharing aimed at stemming cyberattacks on water and power plants and other critical systems. A senior White House official, who briefed reporters prior to the president’s speech, said the order was “not a substitute” for new cybersecurity laws, which are still needed.Jody Westby, CEO of consultancy Global Cyber Risk, says wider sharing of intelligence about what criminals and spies are doing is a good thing. But Westby worries that NIST, in particular, could develop an unwieldy framework of mandatory standards for critical infrastructure companies.“This sort of overreaching by the president could result in numerous legal challenges over his ability to usurp the powers of the legislative branch,” Westby says.Chris Bronk, fellow of information technology at Rice University, says voluntary standards implemented by federal agencies will only go so far. “All you’re doing is leaving it to the agencies to reallocate existing resources,” he says. “It (the order) basically just asks for a lot of planning and reporting about what to do next.”Pravin Kothari, CEO of encryption company CipherCloud, for one, is optimistic that the president’s directive will foster collaboration and data sharing. “Bringing key industry sectors and the government to the same table will enable our … more"

Yet electronic signatures do have their security limitations. That’s why “wet” signatures, i.e. signing in the presence of a notary, remains a requirement for some transactions involving high dollars or very sensitive records.Clearly, a more robust approach to verifying identities in the current and future digital landscape would be useful. After all, conducting business transactions strictly online was already on the rise before Covid 19, a trend that only accelerated due to the global pandemic.And this is why DigiCert recently introduced DigiCert® Document Signing Manager (DSM) – an advanced hosted service designed to increase the level of assurance of the identities of persons signing documents digitally.I had the chance to learn more about this new tool from Brian Trzupek, DigiCert’s senior vice president of product DigiCert is best known as a Certificate Authority (CA) and a supplier of services to manage Public Key Infrastructure.

Patton once declared that “fixed fortifications are monuments to man’s stupidity.” In this guest essay, Brian Contos, chief security officer at forensics firm Solera Networks notes how that observation is particularly apropos to cyberwarfare.)By Brian ContosHistory has taught us how technology can shift advantage. Steel gave the Romans advantage over the iron weapons possessed by Greeks. Infantries armed with muskets gave the Ottoman Empire advantage over forces dependent on longbows, swords and armor. In the 20th century, Germany rose to military strength with emphasis on armored warfare: tanks.The Germans didn’t invent the tank. The British and French had fielded more tanks during WW II. But it was the Germans who understood the advantage that the mastery of armored warfare would provide and were highly successful in a number of tank battles.Today, information warfare, also called cyberwarfare, while still in its infancy, is equally disruptive.Cyberattacks can include stealing valuable corporate research, intercepting military communications and the destruction of computer systems. These attacks can be used to augment traditional, kinetic attacks – those using troops and guns, or to destroy physical assets such as power generation facilities or systems used to control emergency services.Cyberattacks present a great risk to industrialized nations, which are highly connected and extremely dependent on computers from the electric grid and financial services to transportation and national defense. Developing nations, such as emerging and frontier countries throughout parts of Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia are less dependent on computers. As a result, they have a lower cyber risk profile.Many developing nations see cyber as an equalizer – a mechanism to shift advantage in the face of superior technology and numbers. As a result, these countries are making investments to develop talent, techniques and technology related to information warfare. For example, it’s difficult to get empirical evidence about North Korea, but it has been sited … more"

The average cost for all attacks reported by the poll takers:  $229,000. That included average damage of $1.05 million reported by Amercian companies with 1,000-plus employees. For companies with fewer than 100 employees, average costs ranged from $24,000 in Spain to $63,000 in Germany.Upon examining each of the 4,100 companies’ security strategy, as well as its execution of that strategy, Hiscox found that just  11 percent scored highly enough in both areas to qualify as cyber security “experts.” Meanhwile, one in six firms – just 16 … more"

And new research suggests they might be on to something.Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds aside, a new study conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of ClickSoftwarefinds that those small devices in our pockets are actually productivity powerhouses.In fact, the study shows that smartphone productivity apps — like those for e-mail or scheduling — save device users up to 88 minutes a day, or 22 days per year.It turns out apps do more than help users accomplish almost anything from anywhere. They save us a lot of money, according to the ClickSoftware study.The poll shows that American smartphone owners paid an average of $174 for their current smartphone, however, the ubiquitous accessory could actually put up to $12,000 in time-saving value in its owner’s palm.This dollar amount represents the 97 percent of American smartphone owners who use apps and report that such usage saves them up to 88 minutes a day, equivalent to as much as 22 days’ worth of free time per year.Certainly these findings make a compelling case for companies to empower workers with mobility. At the same time, this anytime/anywhere business carries significant security risk.Given the eye-opening productivity stats, along with predictions that BYOD in the enterprise is expected to continue its steep growth trajectory over the next two years, a new line of security products has emerged.Those products are designed to protect personal devices without penetrating the user privacy, by “splitting” the device in two partitions – one for personal use and the other for business use. The organization gets a full control over the business part, while the employee gets to do whatever he wants with his private partition.Until … more"

The tech giants are all hustling to swell profits derived from products and services tied into the Internet cloud. A necessary ingredient to accomplish that — consumer trust – has been put under another kind of cloud by the Prism disclosures.“It’s no secret that the tech companies are in damage control right now trying to regain their users’ trust,” says Jonathan Mayer, fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society.CONTEXT: Why online tracking is a privacy time bombVIDEO:Data mining pits national security vs. individual privacyAt the moment, there is a gap in the facts between what the PowerPoint slides leaked by Snowden appear to depict – and Google’s flat denials; in particular, the company insists that its senior executives, at least, never heard of Prism before it splashed into global headlines last week. Even so, Google disclosed today that it did hand over consumer data to the feds, but only using rudimentary technologies.Google’s corporate spokesman, Chris Gaither, issued this statement: “We refuse to participate in any program — for national security or other reasons — that requires us to provide governments with access to our systems or to install their equipment on our networks. When required to comply with these requests, we deliver that information to the US government–generally through secure FTP transfers and in person.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just a guy who likes to do security testing, penetration. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like any other hobby.Ã¢â‚¬ÂIt has become very easy to break into sites using SQL injection. Hackers can easily download automated tools to locate sites running vulnerable applications — you can even use Google. According to IBM’s X-Force research team, SQL injection attacks increased a Ã¢â‚¬Å“staggeringÃ¢â‚¬Â 134% in 2008 and doubled from Q1 to Q2 of 2009.So many of these vulnerable sites exists because all too many Web applications  — created by a generation of inexperienced programmers — donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t adhere to good coding practices, leaving back-end databases wide open to manipulation.

For years, captchas have helped to stop or bog down automated programs aimed at creating, among other things, e-mail accounts that promote scams such as fake computer virus protection and bogus accounts on social websites that can be used to collect personal information on legitimate users.Now, security specialists say, a growing number of captcha-breaking groups are using real people to type in captcha responses for cybergangs around the world. This is allowing the gangs to create fake e-mail and social-network accounts by the tens of thousands – and use them as the starting point for a variety of cyberscams spread by e-mail and instant messages.MySpace and Facebook say that, so far, they have kept such attacks largely in check. But security researchers say that as long as captchas are a key security feature on networking websites, cyberattacks on such sites are likely to intensify.“We shouldn’t have any illusions about captchas,” says Sergei Shevchenko, a virus hunter at Internet security firm PC Tools. “If the professionals want to break in, they’ll do it.”For social-networking sites that have exploded in popularity during the past two years – Facebook now claims more than 200 million members – the stakes are enormous.The social networks, scrambling to build audiences and ad revenue, want to avoid e-mail’s fate: Today, 90% of all e-mail traffic is spam, and companies across the nation pour vast resources into keeping legitimate e-mail viable by filtering away spam.Meanwhile, cybergangs recognize the … more"

These services have been available for some time, with comparatively light adoption. However, one leading example, from Keeper Security, that’s very powerful, yet fairly intuitive to use, is helping to change that.Keeper is a password management and file storage service organized around putting all of your logons, for all of your web accounts—as well as logons to access sensitive files—in one central location.Related infographic: Americans live with ‘data insecurity’To use the service, you simply put all your user names and passwords for all of your online accounts into a digital vault. Into this digital vault you also can upload photo images of all your credit cards, images of your tax returns, and/or any other sensitive digital files that should be for your eyes only.Instead of trying to remember weak passwords for all of your web accounts, you rely on Keeper to execute all of your log-in procedures within your digital vault.Keeper securely handles each logon, generating a unique high-strength password for each web account and each file you choose to store in your digital vault.The benefit is that no bad guy—or good guy, for that matter—can access the account information and sensitive files sitting inside your Keeper digital vault.

The Times’  description, published Saturday, used unnamed sources.The tech companies have said they obeyed the law of the land while participating in the PRISM program. The specific data requests, as well as the data transfers, were blessed by a federal judge and vetted by corporate attorneys.And use of a highly secure digital storage location to make the data hand off is a tried-and-true methodology used on Wall Street for more than 20 years.When putting together merger and acquisition deals, the principals involved typically agree to place proprietary business information that has been encrypted into a secure “data room,” where the timing of who has access to specific data is strictly controlled, says Gant Redmon, a privacy expert and general counsel at Co3 Systems.“Data rooms have become the most secure way to assure strong end-to-end encryption, authorization and accountability of access,” Redmon says. “When you’re doing due diligence involving massive amounts of critical information, and you want to make sure the information doesn’t fall into the wrong hands, that’s what data rooms are used for.”The fact that tech companies have said they obeyed the law of the land while participating in the PRISM program may be beside the point, as this story develops.Joel Reidenberg, a law professor at Fordham Law School, notes that France, Spain, Germany and other European national governments have long been adamant about being involved in controlling any U.S. law enforcement efforts to access to any data about any … more"

Carey has graciously answered LastWatchdog’s questions about the wider significance of the rash of breaches where account logins are the targeted booty.LW: Some people might think passwords stolen from Epsilon, Stratfor, Zappos, LinkedIn, Formspring and now Yahoo aren’t that big a deal.Carey: The actual value of the credentials lies in which sites they are harvested from. For example, if I was interested in attacking government or military related sites, I’d place credentials collected from Stratfor in high regard. If I’m interested in attacking a technology firm, I’d probably prefer credentials from LinkedIn. Attackers are very strategic . . . The prevalence of people using the same username and passwords on websites leads to the high probability of attackers being able to pivot the attacks.LW: Can it be shown that password breaches are, indeed, accelerating?Carey: What we are seeing is an acceleration in the ability for attackers to crack passwords due to new password cracking algorithms and hardware; Moore’s Law is in full effect. There is a variety of free powerful password cracking tools such as John the Ripper and Hashcat, which are very popular in the password cracking community.LW: What fundamental things are driving this acceleration?Carey: In the last few years attackers and researchers have been using graphics cards for cracking passwords and hashes.

Cluley is among those security experts who contend that Facebook should be doing a more thorough job of filtering poisoned links.Jamie Tomasello , director of security operations at messaging security firm Cloudmark, says social networks have actually conditioned the behavior of users to make them susceptible to the attacks we’re now seeing.“With the rise of the dynamic, short messages, popularized by Twitter and mobile text messaging, users have not only reduced their response time to short messages and updates within social networks, but they are more likely to respond as well,” says Tomasello.She notes that you don’t have to be logged into the social networking site to receive updates as smartphone apps constantly alert users to Facebook updates. “Unfortunately this desire to quickly be informed of the events of the world conditions users to read and respond without taking pause to consider the consequences of their actions,” says Tomasello.While poisoned e-mail messages have plateaued over the past couple of years, the rate of social networking scams has increased, says Gunter Ollmann, research vice president at network security firm Damballa. “It’s generally much easier to reach a large audience and fool them into clicking on a link within a social networking application than it is with embedding it within an email.”Certain criminal organizations have spent time and resources refining specialty expertise useful for social network attacks.

That’s just step one of a grand plan to closely study – and proactively manage – traffic behaviors of cyclists, vehicles, pedestrians and joggers. This is all in pursuit of the high-minded goal of eliminating all accidents that result in death or serious injury.Portland is shooting high, and it is by no means alone. Companies in utilities, transportation and manufacturing sectors are moving forward with the Industrial Internet of Things, or IIoT. Plans are being implemented to tie ever more sensors together across the Internet, use them to gather vast amounts of operational data and then massage this data with advanced behavior analytics.Much the same progression is overtaking consumer goods businesses. Our homes and work spaces are on a fast track to get ever smarter. Everyone in business, it seems, is consumed by the notion of leveraging IoT to add value to their operations.The big hitch, of course, is that major privacy and security gaps have yet to be accounted for. Billions of computing nodes and sensors tied into the Internet are feeding rich data to analytics systems – with billions more IoT devices to come. The trend increases the odds of two unwanted outcomes: invasive surveillance and increased exposure to hackers.The good news is that there is wide acknowledgment among corporate and political leaders that these profound privacy and security concerns must be comprehensively resolved if IoT is to approach full fruition. Public awareness and transparency will be vital. That said, here’s what consumers and companies ought to grasp about the Internet of Things.History of IoTA technologist named … more"

Companies collect it, exchange it, store it, and use it to leverage their business models. In this LastWatchdog guest blog post, Gary Shottes,  President at Ipswitch File Transfer, outlines the emerging security and legal liability implications. Ipswitch supplies file transfer management tools.By Gary ShottesWe are in the midst of an evolution of how companies manage and control their data. Recent high-profile data breaches — such as AT&TÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disclosure of the e-mail addresses of 100,000 high-profile iPad users,  and the resulting consumer backlash, have made protecting company information less of a policy question and more of a mission-critical operational task for IT departments.The iPad/AT&T incident vividly showed how disclosure can happen in unexpected ways if certain doors to the enterprise are left unguarded because they only serve a supporting or maintenance function, as file transfers between business partners often does.Even at the most attentive companies, the contradictory mix of ever-increasing data volumes, increasingly strict corporate governance and rising availability expectations lead people to wonder how all those file transfers can be supported, let alone secured.Facebook is an example of a company whose public struggles with volume, privacy/security and availability challenges have been well documented.  In January one of its partners, a widget provider called RockYou, was hit with a class action lawsuit alleging that the company failed to protect its users’ Personally Identifiable Information.Whether or not this lawsuit will directly affect Facebook may hinge on the technical care Facebook took of any data exchanged with RockYou.Outside partners aren’t the only ones increasing legal risk. Internally, hard-working employees are doing it  too. These are the highly-motivated workers willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done, with or without IT.

AcohidoWeek ending Aug. 18. A Ukrainian hacker called “Profexer” who built one of the tools used to penetrate the Democratic National Committee servers last year has turned himself in to authorities. The man, who first contacted Ukrainian police earlier this year, claims he wrote a piece of software called the PAS Web shell, which the Department of Homeland Security has identified as malware used in the hack. The hacker maintains that he wasn’t behind the attack, which resulted in the release of thousands of emails sent by DNC staffers during the presidential campaign. Because there is no evidence that he used the tool to carry out the attack, he wasn’t arrested. Profexer is in touch with the FBI and is able to identify users involved in the DNC hack by their online handles. Also emerging from Ukraine is a sharper picture of what the U.S. government believes is a Russian government hacking group known as Fancy Bear. American intelligence believes it is operated by Russian military intelligence.

Diving one level deeper into the scenario that led up to the popular ride-hailing service losing personal data for 50 million passengers and seven million drivers shows us why this particular type of hack is likely to recur many more times in 2018.Related podcast: Why DevOps and security are destined to intersectHackers got deep into Uber’s Amazon Web Services platform. They did this by somehow obtaining, then using the AWS logon credentials of one of Uber’s software developers, who left those credentials accessible on GitHub. Though we don’t know nitty gritty details, security analysts say something like this had to have happened:While working on an AWS coding task, the Uber developer took some of this code base and uploaded it to GitHub.  No security sins to this point. ‘Git’ is a system for controlling the latest version of software programs; GitHub is an online repository where developers upload code for peer reviews and such.Here’s the wider context: imagine the degree to which Uber, in order to connect riders and drivers, uses software to tie into services hosted by Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, iPhone and Android. Uber is a prime example of an Internet-centric enterprise comprised of a collection of tools and services hosted by myriad partners.

Marla Suttenberg had a sinking feeling that a corporate spy was shadowing her.In March 2008, the owner of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.-based Sapphire Marketing was preparing to give a longtime client a generous price cut on $134,000 worth of audio/videoconferencing equipment.But before her sales rep could extend the offer, her chief rival, David Goldenberg, then regional vice president of sales for AMX, a Dallas-based conferencing systems maker, sent the client an e-mail disparaging Sapphire and offering a steeper AMX discount.“I felt sick to my stomach,” Suttenberg recalls. To pull that off, someone had to have infiltrated Sapphire’s internal e-mail, she thought at the time.She was right. A few days later, Goldenberg, 48, of Oceanside, N.Y., was arrested. He subsequently pleaded guilty to felony wiretapping for tampering with Sapphire’s e-mail. He was sentenced last month to three months probation and ordered to undergo counseling. “There was nothing sophisticated about me getting into their e-mail,” he said in an interview. “Honestly, I had no idea that it was illegal.”Corporate espionage using very simple tactics – much of it carried out by trusted insiders, familiar business acquaintances, even janitors – is surging. That’s because businesses large and small are collecting and storing more data than ever before. What’s more, companies are blithely allowing broad access to this data via nifty Internet services and cool digital devices.“Having more sensitive information being seen by more people and accessed on more devices drives up risk significantly,” says Kurt Johnson, vice president at Courion, a supplier of identity management systems.The slumping economy doesn’t help. “Mass layoffs have increased internal threat levels dramatically,” says Grant Evans, CEO of ActivIdentity, which makes smart cards and security tokens.Employees worried about job security face rising temptations to seek out and hoard proprietary data that could help boost their job performance, or at least … more"

But this latest variant is a doozy. More on this below. But first consider the context:Clampi is one of a few dozen major families of “banking Trojans,” each with thousands of variants. Cutting-edge banking Trojans evolve in Brazil, for reasons outline by IBM ISS researcher Gunter Ollmann in this LastWatchdog post. In North America, banking Trojans, like ZueS, Torpig, Xorpig and Mebroot all use different encryption and obfuscation techniques.So the good-guy researchers’ understanding of them is somewhat piecemeal. One common scenario is that cyber robbers buy the latest variant of their favorite banking Trojan, customize them, and then use them to access consumer online banking accounts. They then transfer funds to “mule accounts” — often using unwitting folks recruited via email or online job sites.In one real-life example a gang of German cyber robbers used a customize version of ZeuS to pull off an Ocean’s 11-like heist for $6 million. See LastWatchdog’s full account of that caper here.Impenetrable encryptionBack to Clampi. Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of Clampi was its impenetrable encryption.

For over a decade, the data protection regulations of the European Union and its member states have represented the most stringent of their type in the world.Germany, in particular, has been at the forefront in enforcing these laws. These regulations generally prohibit the transfer of personal data of EU citizens to any country that lacks adequate data protection safeguards unless approved by the citizen’s member state.Beginning in 2012, the EU initiated a process to further strengthen its approach to the protection of personal data and to ensure unified treatment and enforcement across all of its member states. In response to these new reports of government surveillance, the US can expect a critical review of its status as a permitted recipient of EU personal data.In 2000, the European Commission and the US Department of Commerce instituted a “Safe Harbor” framework to prevent the EU’s then-newly enacted data protection regulations from interrupting data flows between the US and the EU member states.

The same can be said for new areas of growth like the cloud, mobile payments and Internet-connected devices.And yet, while so much is riding on the Internet’s ability to function securely and protect its users, not enough is being done to keep pace with a growing number of threats that could diminish the reliability of the cryptographic systems that make a secure Internet possible.Not least of which is the Edward Snowden disclosure, reported back in September, which allegedly shows the U.S. National Security Agency has been able to influence the security standards used to protect HTTPS, and has been able to bypass it.But the threat to HTTPS isn’t just at the nation-state level. It’s also filtering down to the average criminal.
Rohit SethiRohit Sethi is Vice President at Security Compass(Photo: Security Compass)One of these threats was recently the subject of a Department of Homeland Security alert. It’s an attack that is able to bypass the encryption of an HTTPS website, such as your online bank, allowing a hacker to hijack a person’s account in just 30 seconds.

ACT is a grassroots  advocacy and education organization; its membership is comprised of some 3,000  small and mid-size information technology firms globally.“Google is using its search advertising dominance to shakedown trademark  holders,” says ACT executive director Morgan Reed. “It allows counterfeiters to  advertise on its networks, forcing companies like Rosetta Stone to outbid  pirates to prevent them from selling fraudulent copies of its software. Since  Google controls 78% of the search advertising marketplace, Rosetta Stone has no  choice but fight the counterfeiters by continually paying Google more money for  advertising.”Google permits anyone to bid on trademark keywords associated with geographic  locations and many other variables. This forces Rosetta Stone to have to hunt  down counterfeiters in different places, using different criteria. Trademark  holders, in effect, are reduced to playing “a giant game of whack-a-mole,” says  Reed.Google allows trademark holders to register complaints against  counterfeiters. But the search giant, “makes it a very cumbersome process, and  often too costly and time consuming for small businesses,” says Reed.In 2009, the search giant generated $23.9 billion in revenue — $22.8 billion from online advertising.Google issued a statement last April saying it was pleased with the  dismissal. The company argues that Google users benefit from being able to  choose from a variety of competing advertisers, and that there is no evidence  use of trademarks in advertisements confuses consumers.Now Rosetta Stone vs. Google has emerged as one of the most important  trademark appeals of the year, a case that is likely to attract … more"

The FTC also ordered the company to establish a comprehensiveÃ‚Â  security program, subject to government monitoring for the next 10 years.Twitter agreed to those terms in exchange for the FTC not pursuing a civil lawsuit against the company. It was the agency’sÃ‚Â  first-ever privacy enforcement action against a social network.“When a company promises consumers that their personal information is secure, it must live up to that promise,” says David Vladeck, head of the FTCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bureau of Consumer Protection.

AcohidoLast Watchdog’s News Wrap, Vol. 1, No. 6. Cyber criminals have discovered a new pathway to monetization that’s as trouble free as anthything they could have dreamed up: crypto mining on the back of hacked websites. Security vendor Cyren put out results of a study this week showing a 725% spike in the number of websites hosting cryptocurrency mining software in January 2018 as compared to September 2017.Dark Reading’s Jai Vijayan reports that much of the growth is being fueled by the insane run-up in cryptocurrency prices in recent months. For instance, the value of Monero, the most widely mined cryptocurrency at the moment, increased by 250% during the four-month period when Cyren was monitoring some 500,000 websites.Related article: Why massive Mirai IoT botnet is so worrisomeInserting two lines of JavaScript can divert some of a website’s processing capabilities to crypto mining. But to do it at a scale that matters, one would have to control a vast number of websites. It’s trivial for a motivated hacker to find and access vulnerable websites.“Crypto mining represents a minuscule portion of all web-based malware,” observes Chris Olson, CEO of security consultancy The Media Trust. “It’s just another weapon employed by bad actors. It’s unlikely that any well-known brand or website would knowingly allow their digital asset to be used for cryptomining without clearly communicating it to users.“The problem is that most websites don’t know they’ve been compromised. The continuing use of cryptomining script underscores the importance of knowing your digital partners and the code they execute in your digital environment.”"

Most businesses must adhere to the “always- on” world and stay connected with customers that cause potential concerns securing sensitive data.Many government agencies, healthcare providers and small businesses often presume that a low profile will help them escape the reach of cyberattacks.However, according to the 2013 Verizon Data Breach Report, three out of four companies attacked in 2012 were organizations with 100 people or less. The lack of a strong cyberdefense carries hidden costs in the form of lost intellectual property or legal liabilities.With the rise of cloud and mobile devices, company information is no longer held within the business’ physical walls. End-users are downloading personal applications on company-issued devices or storing work information on personal devices.Every industry approaches cybersecurity with a unique set of compliance standards. Within healthcare, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations and Payment Card Industry (PCI) requirements focus on protecting personally identifiable information (PII) data.Similarly, the federal government created the Federal Risk Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) as a rigorous, government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to secure the cloud. The small business space can benefit from a similar degree of rigor in approaching security.A year ago, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created a tailored small business Cyber Security Planning guide that allows a user to customize the security recommendations. Through this, the guide gives recommendations on specific issues like privacy, fraud, and policy development management. Small businesses can easily adopt best practices in cybersecurity.Small businesses owners should consider all stakeholders in their security strategy. Data security must extend beyond the business to consider protecting all customers, investors, partners, and employees’ PII by guarding devices that … more"

This includes movies, music, gaming applications, software tools, multimedia presentations and the like.But cyberlocker companies have not come up with a good way to consistently stop copyright infringement. “As soon as you let users trade files back and forth, you really don’t have much control,” says Wade Williamson, senior security analyst at firewall supplier Palo Alto Networks.The motion-picture industry, for one, has been pushing U.S. regulators to enforce copyrights with respect to film content showing up in cyberlockers.One recent measure of how widespread the problem is comes from Palo Alto Network’s recent analysis of the Internet traffic at 1,636 companies, with more than 4 million employees, in the second half of 2011.The analysis found employees at six in 10 companies used Megaupload to download large content files. Overall, 25% of corporate traffic to and from cyberlockers came from Megaupload, which specialized in entertainment content.

Meanwhile, China has shown just how swift and effective policing measures can be.The bottom line: the bad guys remain several steps ahead, in terms of effective tactics and refined automation. “The scripts and methods used to compromise legitimate servers have been getting better and better,” says Kaspersky senior researcher Roel Schouwenberg. “Combine that with more effective BlackhatÃ‚Â  SEO tactics and social engineering campaigns in Facebook and other social networks and there are just more opportunities for cybercriminals.”Kaspersky Lab reports that 28% of 1.9 million servers it found distributing malware in the first three months of this year were located in the U.S. That compares to China as the source of  33% of 85.9 million malicious servers Kaspersky tracked down in the final quarter of 2009.Russia is currently the no. 2 source, accounting for 22.6% of malicious servers, with China now no. 3, with 12.8%. So in a matter of months, China has more than halved the source of malicious servers operating within its jurisdiction. This is vividly shown by the shrinking green pie slice:Chinese authorities recently have begun implementing more stringent procedures for registering Internet addresses, saysÃ‚Â  Schouwenberg. A written statement is now required and the requesting party must provide passport information and complete a lengthy application to a national agency, the CNNIC.In the U.S. and Russia, it’s still quick and anonymous to register new domains via services such as Go Daddy.“It would be interesting to see what will happen if regulations like the ones in China were to catch on in other countries,” says Schouwenberg. “It shows that … more"

AcohidoUncertainty about several key variables appears to be causing U.S. businesses and insurance companies to move cautiously into the much-heralded, though still nascent, market for cyber liability policies.Insurers continue to be reluctant to make policies more broadly available. The big excuse: Industry officials contend there is a relative lack of historical data around cyber incidents, and they also bemoan the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats.This assessment comes in a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services titled: Demystifying Cyber Insurance Coverage: Clearing Obstacles in a Problematic But Promising Growth Market“Insurers don’t have sufficient data to write coverage extensively with confidence,” says Sam Friedman, insurance research leader at Deloitte.But the train is about to leave, and some of the stalwarts who shaped the insurance business into the ultra conservative (read: resistant to change) sector it has become could very well be left standing at the station.Consider that regulations imposing tighter data handling and privacy protection requirements are coming in waves. Just peek at the New York Department of Financial Services’ newly minted cybersecurity requirements; or Europe’s recently revamped General Data Protection Regulation.With cyber threats on a steadily intensifying curve, other jurisdictions are sure to jump on the regulation bandwagon, which means the impetus to make cyber liability coverage a standard part of everyday business operations will only increase.Related podcast: Cybersecurity and cyber insurance innovators convergeMeanwhile, cybersecurity entrepreneurs, backed by savvy venture capitalists, are moving aggressively to eliminate the weak excuse that there isn’t enough data available to triangulate complex cyber risks. In fact, the opposite is true.Modern-day security systems, such as anti-virus suites, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, malware sandboxes and SIEMS, generate mountains of data about the security health of business networks.

The recipient is asked to type in logon information as part of “system maintenance.” Later, the attacker will access the website and upload faked online banking pages, or begin storing stolen dataÃ‚Â  in support of broader online banking phishing campaigns.The advantage gained by this two-stage phishingÃ‚Â  attack: the intruder doesn’t need to hack into the website,Ã‚Â  which can send up red flags andÃ‚Â  trigger inoculations. “Criminals do not need to use hacking tools to upload content to a website,” says Klein. “Therefore they can avoid detection until after they have siphoned funds from consumer and business banking accounts.”Trusteer makes a browser plug-in, called Rapport, which it sells mostly to financial institutions. RapportÃ‚Â  protects sensitive personal data and disrupts these types of phishing attacks.There are plenty of free and relatively inexpensive security tools for consumers.

First, .com, .info, .net and .org will no longer comprise the core  generic top level domains, or gTLDs, we’ve come to know and love. ICANN is about to expand gTLDs so than any public or private organizations worldwide may obtain their own branded domain name extensions.Second, IPv6 will begin to replace IPv4. This will vastly expand the number of unique IP addresses needed to assign not just to Internet-connected PCs, but also to billions of mobile devices.In this LastWatchdog guest post, Lance Wolak, Director, Marketing & Product Management for .ORG, The Public Interest Registry,  delves into the nuances and go-forward implications of these milestone developments.By Lance WolakIt is obvious that the Internet continues to evolve at a phenomenal rate. In the year ahead, however, two major changes will materialize that could impact the stability of the Internet as we know it: the introduction of new gTLDs and the beginning of mass adoption of IPv6. While these new developments have the potential to be enormously beneficial, without a precautionary approach to preparation, these pending changes could put this indispensable resource at risk.In December, at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) meeting in Cartagena, Columbia, one of the main topics of discussion was the introduction of new generic Top-Level Domain Names (gTLD). It has been determined that the process will begin as early as June. This is significant because, for the first time, public and private organizations worldwide will be able to apply for their own branded gTLDs. In other words, such well-known staples like .COM and .ORG may soon be accompaniedÃ¢â‚¬â€œ as early as 2012 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by brand-specific domain names like .CANON or .NOKIA.

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also time for utilities to hold their software  vendors accountable for flawed architectures and vulnerable technologies.  The risks are too great to take lightly.At the 2009 Black Hat security conference, security consultancy IOActive reported that it was able to simulate a smart meter worm that infected about 15,000 home meters (out of 22,000 homes) and subjected the devices to the control of the wormÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designers.  At the time, IOActiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mike Davis stated that, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the vast majority of smart meter systems use no encryption or authentication processes to prevent someone from uploading malicious software or turning meters on and off en masse.Ã¢â‚¬ÂLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s be clear: any time that you connect devices into a network, you face security risks.

Scammers are expert at using Social Security numbers belonging to children or dead persons to create a fictitious new person. The fraudsters patientlyÃ‚Â establish credit, open credit lines, pile up debt — and never pay.

Cunningham has the boots-on-the-ground experience and storytelling chops to pull this off. As a  cybersecurity principal analyst at Forrester,  he advises enterprise clients on how to stay in front of the latest iterations of cyber attacks coming at them from all quarters.Cunningham’s 19 years as a US Navy chief spent in cyber forensic and cyber analytic operations included manning security controls at the NSA, CIA and FBI. He holds a PhD and MS in computer science from Colorado Technical University and a BS from American Military University focused on counter-terrorism operations in cyberspace.Cunningham sets the table in Cyber Warfare by relating detailed anecdotes that together paint the bigger picture. Learning about how hackers were able to intercept drone feed video from CIA observation drones during the war in Iraq, for instance, tells us a lot about how tenuous sophisticated surveillance technology really can be, out in the Internet wild.And Cunningham delves into some fascinating, informative nuance about industrial systems attacks in the wake of Stuxnet. He also adds historical and forward-looking context to the theft and criminal deployment of the Eternal Blue hacking tools, which were stolen from the NSA, and which have been used to cause so much havoc, vis-à-vis WannaCry and NotPetya.

Good timing for these results.Ponemon surveyed security pros in 45 U.S. organizations and concluded that  cybercrime is having a material impact in the corporate arena. Over a four-week period, the 45 organizations experienced 50 successful attacks per week, or more than one successful attack per organization per week, and reported a median annual cost of $3.8 million per organization per year.The smallest loss was $1 million; the biggiest, nearly $52 million.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every corporation is vulnerable to thousands of cyber attacks that occur daily across all industries, causing information theft, disruption to business operations and serious financial loss,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Dr. Larry Ponemon, founder and chairman of the Ponemon Institute.Ponemon recommends that companies appoint of a chief information security officer, or CISO, charge him or her with designing and implementing a security strategy and invest in technologies to defend against complex threats. “Companies are able to reduce the financial impact of cybercrime,” he says.The study also found: The most costly cyber crimes are those caused by web attacks, malicious code and malicious insiders, which account for more than 90% of all cyber crime costs per organization on an annual basis.
 Cyberattacks took up to 42 days or more to resolve, with the average cost to an organization of nearly $18,000 per day.No silver bulletNo surprisingly, the study also quanitified put a figure a number on how much organizations can save by buying and implementing so-called Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM systems, of the kind sold by ArcSight, CheckPoint, eIQ Networks, High Tower, Q1 Labs, NetIQ, Cisco and RSA.Ponemon found that the participating companies that had deployed a SIEM system … more"

It is easy to understand this position.Recently, NSS Labs evaluated six network firewalls, finding that all six firewalls failed to stay operational when subjected to stability tests and that five out of six were vulnerable to â€œSneak ACK attack.â€ Of course, it would be naÃ¯ve to believe that eliminating perimeter security would solve this problem. Instead, we must reconsider perimeter security.Indeed, the concept of the perimeter is evolving as services move into the cloud, due to the ever-increasing use of mobile devices for business applications. Nevertheless, despite showing signs of age, the classic perimeter is still there protecting all the networks that are inside your campuses, and it is as important as it ever was. You absolutely still need your firewalls, filtering routers and VPN devices.Moving a service to the cloud is the e-equivalent of moving manufacturing offshore: it doesn’t mean you can eliminate the security check at the entrance to your main office. There is still a lot of valuable information in the network that needs protection.Rethinking the perimeter means that you also need to worry about the security of your outsourced assets. As many enterprises have seen in the Epsilon data breach, moving your data to the cloud can come back and bite you: if the outsourced data is not properly secured – you as the data owner will pay the price if it’s stolen, leaked, … more"

The big driver back then was to assemble botnets to spread spam. Today botnets have become the engine that drives all forms of cyber attacks. It’s simple enough to identify bot traffic on the Internet, and even pinpoint the IP address of specific bots. Many security companies can do this. But it has becomeÂ  next to impossible to systematically wipe out botnets. TheÂ  big reason:Â  botted PCs are in constant use by millions of average consumers and workers in homes and workplaces all across the globe.Practically speaking, there is noÂ  way toÂ  inoculate these PCs at a scale that would make a difference — not without disrupting Internet-commerce as we’ve come to know it.Â  In this LastWatchdog guest post, Tomer Teller, a researcher at firewall pioneer Check Point Software Technologies, outlines other factors contributing to the near invincibility of botnets.By Tomer TellerThe first bot, GMBot, was not malicious. In fact, it was created in the late 1980s to emulate a live person in Internet Relay Chat (IRC) sessions. However, around 1999 bots emerged that were designed with harmful intentions. Thereafter, bots grew more sophisticated, and in some cases, were commercialized as products.The Zeus bot of 2006, for example, originally sold for several thousand dollars. In mid-2011, source code for the Zeus and SpyEye botnet kits was leaked, making these powerful botnet creators available to practically anyone that wants to establish their own botnet.Today, botnets are often used as a backdoor into the IT systems of large organizations. Once inside, hackers operate in silence and stay under the radar to steal as much information as possible before their presence is detected.Unfortunately, because bots are so … more"

It fuels the sharing of rich content across Internet-connected devices in the home and office and distributed to mobile devices and has emerged as a major component of cloud computing, the delivery of content and services across the Web.“If legitimate content is housed on the same service that might have infringing content, it gets sucked into this vortex and it’s gone,” says Dennis Fisher, security blogger at Threatpost.com. “I don’t know how much the government or these companies (advocating strict anti-piracy enforcement) have thought this through. I would guess not a lot.”Federal authorities shut down Megaupload.com, one of the world’s most popular file-sharing sites, Thursday and accused it of costing copyright holders more than $500 million in lost revenue from pirated films, music and other content.Four executives arrested in New Zealand appeared Friday in an Auckland courtroom to begin extradition proceedings that could take more than a year. Three others remain at large.According to New Zealand’s Fairfax Media, a defense lawyer raised objections to a media request to photograph the proceedings, but his client, Megaupload chief Kim Dotcom, spoke out, saying he would not object “because we have nothing to hide.”The judge granted the media access, and ruled that Dotcom and the three other suspects would remain in custody until Monday, the next scheduled hearing in the case.The five-count indictment, which alleges copyright infringement as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering and racketeering, described a site designed specifically to reward users who uploaded pirated content for sharing, and turned a blind eye to requests from copyright holders to remove copyright-protected files.It was unsealed a day after technology companies staged an online … more"

That incident helps support the viability of a new approach security vendor Lumension has recently begun advocating, called ‘intelligent whitelisting.”Intelligent whitelisting works by scanning an entire network for malicious programs, then cleaning up any infections. Lumension then takes a snapshot the clean network before locking it down. No new applications are permitted to run, unless expressly authorized by an IT manager. Lumension contends that intelligent whitelisting greatly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized code running on a corporate network, while eliminating the possibility of a major blacklisting faux pas, like the one that struck McAfee’s corporate customers.In this exclusive LastWatchdog Q&A,Ã‚Â  CEO Pat Clawson explains how Lumension arrived at a product strategy he says is designed to combine the best features of whitelisting and blacklisting.

The attacks increasingly have a geopolitical bent.Two prominent global hacktivist collectives — Anonymous and LulzSec — gained notoriety over the past two years for disrupting the Web presence of scores of corporations and government agencies, then bragging about it on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. Their standing motive: Mete out punishment for perceived bad corporate practices and unfair government policies.The FBI earlier this year coordinated the arrests of LulzSec’s alleged ring.But the new twist on denial-of-service attacks is that they often appear to be carried out by governments bent on squelching online discussions of political corruption and human rights abuses in places such as Burma, North Korea, China, Russia and Africa, say tech-security and Internet experts.Although the emerging evidence is largely anecdotal, it appears that entrenched governments in political hot spots are rapidly embracing the latest hacktivist techniques. Their endgame: Avoid a repeat of the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere in which political reformers rallied supporters primarily over the Internet.Supporters of established regimes are moving early and often to quash criticism in blogs, online publications and human rights websites with denial-of-service attacks before such discourse gets amplified on Facebook, Twitter and other social-media sites.“We are seeing nation-states use such techniques as a precursor to physical warfare or as a way of silencing dissent,” says Harry Sverdlove, chief technology officer at tech security firm Bit9. Predictable patternsThis rising … more"

Plenty of criminals are searching for vulnerabilities in networks, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that cybersecurity issues have become more prevalent.Related: President Biden issues cybersecurity executive orderFor the past 17 years, October has been designated as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM) to focus much needed attention on cybersecurity.Here’s how NCSAM came to be and how to get involved, as well as tips to increase your security efforts.NCSAM launched in 2004, at a time where technology was nowhere near where it is today. We still relied on flip phones, and broadband internet was becoming more accessible for people worldwide.The National Cybersecurity Alliance (NCSA) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) came together to help Americans feel safer and more secure while online. The start of NSCAM may have resulted from multiple Chinese cyberattacks, later called Titan Rain, on the U.S. government."

The logons, contacts and preferences stolen from Facebook accounts feed intelligence into the cyberunderground which spammers can use to hone their spam campaigns.For instance, they can fake Facebook postings and messages to specific individuals at targeted companies to help them gain access inside corporate networks, where they seek out and usurp privilege accounts. It’s not hard to imagine a well-positioned intruder discovering ways to overcome spam filters at targeted companies.First discovered in 2008, Koobface volume tripled in the first quarter of 2013 to levels never previously seen, Weafer says.Koobface is a case study of how swiftly cybercriminals react to emerging trends.Its creators initially sent Facebook users friendly messages asking them to click on a link to see a video. Doing so called up another message asking the recipient to click on an executable file — a small computer program — needed to upgrade a video player required to view the video. In a classic bait-and-switch, clicking on the file instead turned over control of the PC to the attackers. The worm then automatically sent similar viral messages from the victim’s account to his or … more"
1641448341-551,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/122,How Edward Snowden could sidestep extradition,"(Editor’s note: In this guest essay, former federal prosecutor Jacques Semmelman, now a partner at Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, outlines the intricacies of extraditing whistleblower Edward Snowden.)By Jacques SemmelmanThe case of Edward Snowden, the admitted NSA leaker, creates a dilemma for the U.S. government. Ordinarily, a person who commits a crime in the U.S. is formally charged with the crime or crimes committed. If the accused has fled the country, those charges form the basis of a request for extradition to the U.S. to stand trial. Snowden has yet to be formally charged. What makes Snowden’s case unusual is that charges involving unauthorized disclosure of classified information could trigger the “political offense exception” to extradition. And therein lies the rub.The political offense exception is found in most international extradition treaties. It is based on a concept, developed in the nineteenth century and still applied today, that political offenders – a term that lacks a universal definition – should be shielded from extradition. The extradition treaty between the U.S. and Hong Kong (where Snowden is believed to be) contains such an exception. This concept is distinct from that of asylum based on fear of persecution or mistreatment.The political offense exception applies without regard to the fairness of the requesting country’s judicial system or its anticipated treatment of the accused. U.S. courts have stated that treason, sedition, and espionage are political offenses shielded from extradition. Snowden’s unlawful disclosure of classified information might therefore be deemed a political offense. While Hong Kong is not obligated to define “political offense” the way the U.S. defines it, Snowden has an argument that the U.S. should be held to its own standards.Thus, in its charging decision, the U.S. faces a conundrum: on the one hand, the U.S. wants to charge Snowden with the crimes he has committed by disclosing classified information; on the other hand, the U.S. wants to … more"
1641448362-596,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/115,Q&A: HD Moore drills down on aftermath of NY Times hack,"By Byron V. AcohidoSEATTLE — HD Moore, chief research officer at vulnerability management firm Rapid7, has been keeping a close eye on the aftermath of the Syrian Electronic Army’s disruption of websites of the New York Times, Huffington Post and Twitter. Here’s a drill down of what Moore has pieced together with regard to the unfolding scramble to lock down domain names.CT: So how were you able to figure out which Melbourne IT clients were exposed and which ones have applied registry locks?Moore: I walked through the top 250 Alexa sites and ran a whois query. The response from this query indicated whether MelbourneIT was the registrar and whether the registry lock had been applied.CT: So who is instigating the lock downs? Is this action being taken individually by each company for each domain?Moore: Yes, it appears that all registry locks have been driven by the brand owner.CT: What is the general practice with regards to who is responsible for applying such locks?Moore: The general practice is to not apply registry locks at all, as they introduce a hurdle for future changes and transfers. It seems that for some brand owners of high value domains, such as Twitter and Microsoft, these locks were in place as a practical safeguard against attacks on the registrar. The lock must be enabled by the domain owner and in order to unlock the domain, the owner must contact the manager of the top-level domain (TLD), this would be Verisign for all .com domains. And the registrar itself has no control until the domain has been unlocked. The TLD manager requires extensive verification to unlock a domain.CT: Twitter got hacked, though? Can you explain what happened to Twitter versus what happened to the New York Times?Moore: Twitter.com’s registry was locked at the time of the attack. This prevented the attackers from changing the DNS records for the primary Twitter domain. … more"

So it’s fair to say that the average citizen has plenty of reason to follow the federal government’s actions in this domain.It is a positive step that the Cyber Command in Washington intends to hire 4,000 new recruits, quintupling its current force. Yet it remains a mystery as to what roles these recruits will have and the operations they might conduct. There are a number of compelling reasons why more transparency is desperately needed.First and foremost is the need for America to flex its muscles.It is important to accept that in cyber warfare, offense is typically a step or two ahead of defense. There is no such thing as a cast iron defense strategy when new threats and exploits emerge continually.It is therefore essential that the U.S. candidly communicates the ferocious power of its offensive capabilities as a deterrent. Akin to the scenario of mutually assured destruction at the hands of nuclear weapons during the cold war, the threat of vastly destructive retaliatory capabilities is a powerful deterrent for prospective cyber enemies.Another reason for an open approach is the danger of mistaken identity. Due to the intricate workings of the cyber threat landscape, misconstrued actions and intent is all too common, and can have drastic consequences. If wrongly suspected of a cyber attack due to ignorance about its capabilities, America could see retaliation from a major world power based on an attack that the U.S. cyber force didn’t even perpetrate.Finally, … more"

This can violate the warranty, and can cause iPhone to become unstable and not work reliably.”Apple’s conundrum While publicly saying very little of substance, it’s clear Apple is wrestling with a difficult security conundrum. The company is suddenly facing the big, nasty elephant Microsoft has somewhat tamed over theÃ‚Â  past decade —  and Adobe has been forced to come to grips with over the past several months: resolving zero-day vulnerabilities before the bad guys can swoop in and take advantage.Apple may have a patch ready, but that’s just half the ball game.

Google set aside the $500 million last April, as the DOJ probe heated up. The forfeiture of those funds is reportedly one of the largest ever DOJ sanctions.U.S. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole asserts that the  $500 million represents the gross revenues Google collected in ad buys from the Canadian pharmacies, plus the earnings generated from the illegal sales of drugs to American consumers.Major source of revenueSearch advertising generates more than 90% of the search giant’s revenues and profits. Google generated revenues of about $29.3Â  billion in 2010 and net income of $8.5 billion. It keeps growing. The search giant reported revenues of $9.03 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, an increase of 32% compared to the second quarter of 2010.“Google has a very a big incentive to turn a blind eye to all sorts of sketchy and even illegal advertising,” says John Simpson, spokesman for Consumer Watchdog. “That was clearly the case with these illegal drug ads. There are problems with other types of ads, too.”The shipment of prescription drugs from pharmacies outside the United States violates the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and Google had been aware of this since at least 2003, according to the DOJ.Dubious claimsLast February, Consumer Watchdog went public with “Liars and loans: how deceptive advertisers use Google”, a 37-page report outlining how Google profits … more"
1641448597-969,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/62,GUEST ESSAY: How safeguarding user credentials can lower cyber insurance premiums,"By Dean ThompsonAccording to Lloyd’s of London, a massive global cyberattack could result in economic losses as high as $53 billion.Given that, it’s no surprise that an increasing number of businesses are adding cybersecurity coverage to their liability insurance. But as businesses rush to insure, the cost and precise scope of coverage of these policies are coming under under scrutiny. A key question is whether or not non-malicious human activity is covered.On one hand, cybersecurity policies that do not cover human error – which would include falling victim to sophisticated phishing schemes, visiting Trojan-infected sites, or even deferring patches or updates – would be of far more limited value.That’s because, according to a recent Verizon study, 81 percent of breaches are due to compromised credentials. And credentials are often compromised due to human error, such as poor password behavior. Think about it, they’re your credentials and only you know them, so if someone else gets a hold of them, you’ve probably erred.On the other hand, insurance companies offering cybersecurity policies that do cover human error might find themselves in a world of hurt after one successful malware attack makes its $53 billion journey across the globe.That’s a huge number that could question the very solvency of insurance companies after a single attack. And while I hope such attacks will be rare, WannaCry’s breakneck success – infecting 230,000 computers in 150 countries on day one, with damages pegged by Lloyd’s at a cool $8 billion – suggests otherwise.Human error coverageToday, insurance companies offering cybersecurity policies go to varying degrees to ensure businesses are taking adequate steps to secure their data before they write (and price) policies. They are leveraging security experts such as Verizon to perform rigorous evaluations of a company’s security policies prior to determining the premium cost. And the strict protection of user credentials is a key component, as those organizations with least … more"

1641448417-716,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/98,Yahoo hack stirs passwords debate,"SEATTLE – The age of convenient logons may be nearing an end.That’s the upshot of the continuing wave of reports of hackers stealing consumer data from marquee retailers and tech companies, security experts say.Yahoo is the latest example, admitting Thursday that data thieves “gained unauthorized access” to an undisclosed number of Yahoo mail users’ account credentials.Company spokeswoman DJ Anderson emphasized the hackers did not penetrate Yahoo’s network defenses, instead stealing data from a third-party website that allows the use of Yahoo e-mail addresses to create customer accounts.Sidebar Q&A: Why it’s time to use passwords more judiciouslyYahoo is contacting victims individually and advising them to change their passwords and to use distinctive passwords for any online accounts tied to Yahoo mail.“It’s really important for users to understand never to use the same password on multiple sites or services,” Anderson told CyberTruth.But that maxim has been true for the past decade, and too many consumers are still ignorant of it, or ignore it.Meanwhile, Web commerce has come to revolve around account usernames based on a valid e-mail address. Many consumers use the same e-mail address and password to create financial transaction accounts across multiple websites. Cybercriminals know this and are expert at correlating valid e-mail accounts with third-party services. This enables them to steal from financial accounts and carry out a variety of other scams.“The simple username and password just is not an option any longer,” says Robert Siciliano, McAfee online security analyst. “It’s obvious that neither consumers, nor the companies collecting this data, are up to the challenge of keeping this data secure.”Context: Data theft jumps five-fold in 2013The latest Yahoo breach follows disclosures of e-mail addresses stolen from Target, Neiman-Marcus and Michaels.

MandellThe health care sector was alarmed in January 2015 to learn that hackers had broken into the IT system of Anthem and made off with the personal data of as many as 80 million Americans.For those who were only casually familiar with the technical side of data privacy and cybersecurity, it was easy to read the headline and assume that the Indianapolis-based health care giant had committed some egregious act of negligence.However, it bears remembering that even U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered major hacks, as the data dump from WikiLeaks last March amply illustrated. WikiLeaks—recently lambasted as a threat to U.S. national security by CIA Director Mike Pompeo—published juicy details of malware and hacking tools the CIA can use to hack into smart TVs as well as iPhones and Android-based devices.Organizations can put in place best-in-class cybersecurity infrastructure, but the weak point is often human behavior—an employee who falls for a phishing scam and clicks on the wrong link, or an executive who inserts a thumb drive supplied by a “vendor” (in truth, a hacking group’s accomplice) and compromises terabytes of company data.Related story: Say so long to your data privacy under Trump FCC’s new rulesPatients and consumers are people, too, and their behavior with respect to protecting even their own personal data is regrettably lax. Indeed, some internet users are their own worst enemies with respect to data privacy.Few take precautionsThey essentially take zero safety precautions to reduce the risk that their personal information is not needlessly exposed. Instead of checking the privacy policies of the websites they visit and “opting out” of potentially invasive requests, they reflexively give permission to any and all requests.

The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, named Atlanta-based Global Payments as the processor in question.Global Payments declined interview requests.Security blogger Brian Krebs, who broke the story, says thieves cracked into the processorâ€™s systems between Jan. 21 and Feb. 25, and may have swiped more than 10 million credit and debit card transactions records, originating from an unknown number of merchants, banks and credit unions.Gartner banking security analyst Avivah Litan says unverified reports point to a New York City street gang with Central American ties taking over ” an administrative account that was not protected sufficiently.”â€œIâ€™ve spoken with folks in the card business who are seeing signs of this breach mushroom,â€ says Litan.MasterCard issued a statement advising cardholders to contact the financial institution that issued their cards with any concerns.

1641448498-859,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/78,GUEST ESSAY:  The case for persistent security controls to replace prevention mindset,"By Tony GaudaData is widely regarded as a top asset for organizations. And for good reason. Enterprises analyze it to glean insights for making data-driven decisions; internet giants like Google and Facebook collect and sell data for profit; marketing departments leverage it to identify new customers and cultivate loyalty with existing ones; and federal agencies use it to track investigations for national security purposes. While the uses may vary, gaining a competitive edge is a unifying theme among organizations prioritizing data.While data is an asset that should be tracked and managed throughout its entire life cycle, organizations aren’t doing so well given that instances of data breaches are at an all-time high. In 2016 alone, there were 980 breaches with nearly 35,233,317 records exposed. Unfortunately, the negative impact of a data breach can be extensive and costly. For instance, take the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).Cyber criminals got away with confidential data associated with more than 21 million former and existing employees, including more than 19 million individuals that applied for security clearance. The breach also exposed Social Security numbers, military records, history of residence, demographic details, fingerprint records, information about immediate family members and more. And the cost to merely protect victims of the breach from identity theft was over $133 million.Hackers aren’t only ones to blameWhether it’s a malicious insider, careless employee behavior and/or malware, data is always at risk of being stolen. With insider threats, an existing or previous employee or partner with inside access may use legitimate corporate credentials to access and steal data for personal gain and/or to hurt the organization.For example, Edward Snowden leaking NSA documents, the Booz Allen Hamilton contractor who was arrested for stealing classified computer code, or more recently, the alleged theft of Alphabet’s confidential files by a former employee.But employees don’t need to be malicious to cause damage, which is why they are … more"

Facebook’s most recent publicity nightmare has received scrutiny worldwide because multiple millions of users have accounts on the social media platform.However, the facts underlying the uproar over sloppy privacy practices could happen at any company on a much smaller scale. And, so there are lessons that businesses of all sizes can learn.What happened?In the summer of 2014, about 300,000 Facebook users agreed to accept a small payment to download a third party application via Facebook, called This Is Your Digital Life, which presented them with a series of surveys. The Terms of Service in the application disclosed, in broad scope, that the users were granting permission to the application developer to collect and use data on the profile of those downloading the application – and, data from the profiles of their Facebook friends – if their privacy settings allowed it.This is why the number of Facebook profiles compromised exponentially increased from a mere 300,000 users to that of 87 million users. At the time, this practice was seemingly consistent with Facebook’s practice of allowing outside developers … more"

On Monday, Wickr, a free app that encrypts text, voice and video messages, became available on the Android platform.Wickr leaves no trace of your cybermusings on servers or on the device. It was introduced in June 2012 for Apple iOS. Company co-founder Nico Sell champions a return to traditional notions of privacy, and she advocates boycotting Facebook.Sell wants her daughters, ages 4 and 12, to be able to freely express themselves online without fear of being exploited or put in harms way. “Private correspondence is a fundamental human right that’s extremely important to a free society,” says Sell. Facebook and other big Internet companies are ostensibly advertising platforms designed to monetize personal information, she says.In a similar vein, start-ups Silent Circle,Koolspan and Seecrypt offer new systems that use encryption to lock down your cellphone calls and e-mails. These services are aimed at corporate executives and employees who routinely work on sensitive projects.“Various groups are spying, stealing information and organizing fraud against individuals and organizations around the world,” says Jon Callas, co-founder and chief technology officer of Silent Circle. “People see the need for defense against these threats.”These new personalized encryption services enable individuals to wrest back ownership of their online behaviors. That’s a potential challenge to tech giants and media companies whose business models revolve around tracking what you say, where you navigate and, with GPS, where you are physically located. This is driven primarily to better sell advertising.Wider use of locked down phone calls, e-mails and messaging could slow the current iterations of Internet commerce.

Just the fact that the Dallas Summit took place was a huge step forward with regards to the emergence ofÃ‚Â  much-needed collaboration to make the Internet safer. The telecom execs discussed transparency and trust, international communications policies and security for global undersea cable communications. There were a half dozen other such work groups at the Dallas Summit. Each will now begin to work more closely to continue to communicate needs and next steps within the larger security communities. Bauhaus previously spend 20 years at Sun Microsystems in a range of executive assignments. In this LastWatchdogÃ‚Â  guest blog post he describes why deeper, ongoing collaboration by the good guys is a must.By Mark BauhausI was fortunate to take an active role in the EastWest InstituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Worldwide Cybersecurity Summit in Dallas this week, and noted several salient points on todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security landscape. One opener was quite clear from the Summit: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just scare-mongering.  Every passing day, yet another network security incident or threat is being reported. Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a physicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stolen laptop containing confidential patient health information or reading up on recent reports about the consistent uptick in cybercriminals, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to be concerned about the security of your companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network and the confidential information residing within it.WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changed?  The globalization and mobility of the workforce have forced us all to reconsider the networkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack surface. Traditionally, organizations concentrated on strong perimeter defenses. However, perimeters are inadequate today because the attack surface (points that attackers can attempt to exploit) is becoming fractal with all the end points and network pathways that are subject to complex cyber attacks and more intelligent tactics being employed globally. Factor in that data traffic on the mobile handset is growing exponentially. … more"

It maintains databases that are essentially massive catalogues of spam and anti-spam tools. Using this information, SpamHaus helps stop exploits and other security loopholes that could allow spam to reach consumers. LW: Any idea who would be motivated to disrupt SpamHaus? Gorodyansky: Spamhaus says that a web-host called Cyberbunker is collaborating with a Russian and Eastern European criminal organizations to facilitate the attacks. But, really anyone interested in disrupting life online could target SpamHaus. Schneck: In this current situation, motivation is a distraction from the core issue that denial of service attacks such as this are an abuse of distributed computing and other technological advancements that make the Internet a reliable and fast delivery mechanism.LW Is this really the largest Internet attack ever, or is that hyperbole? Gorodyansky: It’s certainly up there. This is just part of an alarming trend that’s affecting our lives online: the hackers are exploiting the many positive aspects of cloud computing – sharing data across the internet instead of locally on your hard drive – and have started to target companies that house massive amounts of personal information.LW: Why should the average person be concerned about this? Schneck: Flooding the … more"

Endpoint security, improved patch management, better business continuity planning, and a strong incident response capability will all be held up as critical to preventing similar future attacks.But what was the root cause of the breach? It may seem that organizations not updating (i.e., patching) their systems in time and leaving them vulnerable to malware like WannaCry is the problem. But why did they need a patch in the first place?Related podcast: Security by design: Embed protection during software developmentDig deeper and examine the reasons. The technical details of the patch point to a security flaw in the way “SMBv1 handles specially crafted requests.” In other words, the root cause is a software vulnerability.Insecure software is to blame, as it almost always is in major hacks. Need proof? Take a look at the Metasploit exploit database. Metasploit is one of the most well-known exploit systems in the world, and the database is full of code that takes advantage of software vulnerabilities like “command execution,” “code execution” and “buffer overflow.” These are all technical names of code flaws that allow an attacker to compromise a remote system, including via malware like WannaCry.Despite the fact that software is the basic issue, it is conspicuously absent from the conversations about next steps after an attack. Insecure code, built in-house or by third parties, is not mentioned in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, gets very little attention in the industry standard ISO 27001, and wasn’t featured as a topic in the recent National Association of Corporate Directors’ Cyber-Risk Oversight document.

1641448394-667,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/105,How Snowden stole from the NSA,"SEATTLE – Edward Snowden wrote himself into history books by pilfering some 50,000 pages of classified intelligence from the National Security Agency.That was last May, and there has been little public discussion about how he did it. Until now.Researchers at security firm Venafi are making a bold claim that they’ve deduced the basic steps Snowden must have taken to abscond with sensitive data protected by state-of-the-art network security systems.To go undetected while copying and transferring a massive trove of NSA documents, Snowden had to have manipulated a couple of technologies most people have never heard of: Secure Shell (SSH) cryptographic keys and digital certificates, asserts Jeff Hudson, Venafi’s CEO.Venafi’s analysis has not been acknowledged by the NSA. However, the strengths — and glaring weaknesses — of SSH technology is well understood in the cybersecurity community.SSH keys and certificates make up the basic method of establishing secure communications between two computers. Together, they authenticate the users of the two computers about to exchange data. They also prevent a third party from intercepting information as it is being transferred. This technology underpins all sensitive Web transactions, including card payments, e-mailing and file transfers.However, cybercriminals, particularly nation-state spies, have become adept at stealing and/or counterfeiting SSH keys and certificates. By using stolen or forged keys and certificates, the bad guys are able to impersonate a legitimate user, as well as cloak data as they steal it.“Keys and certificates help identify and establish trust between systems electronically,” says Hudson. “Unfortunately, criminals now understand how fragile our ability to control trust has become.”Venafi researchers scrutinized interviews with Snowden, investigative reports and public statements by the NSA’s chief, Gen. Keith Alexander. They concluded that Snowden used tried-and-true cyberspying tactics, including fabricating SSH keys and certificates.“The fabrication of SSH keys or self-signed digital certificates are well-known cybercriminal methods,” Hudson says.Snowden was working out of Hawaii as … more"
1641448705-1105,https://www.lastwatchdog.com/page/43,MY TAKE: A new approach to cybersecurity well-suited to digital transformation is here: zero-trust,"By Byron V. AcohidoGiven the ongoing, rapid rise in digital transformation, the “zero-trust” concept is fast gaining traction as the go-to strategy for securing modern business networks.Zero trust refers to the notion of shifting access controls from the perimeter to the individual users and their devices. Thus, these frameworks involve evaluating  the security risk of devices and users within context at any given moment, without automatically conferring network privileges or providing default access based solely on credentials.The idea addresses the fact that business applications and data are now digitally dispersed far and wide, away from the corporate premises. And yet, organizations feel somehow compelled to make access to these digital systems as flexible and convenient as they can, in order to cater to an increasingly mobile workforce.It has become axiomatic that legacy network defenses, focused as they are on erecting a moat and castle walls around on-premise systems, simply cannot preserve the integrity of operations in digitally advanced business networks.Thus, zero trust is fast becoming a mantra in cybersecurity circles, with suppliers of multi-factor authentication (MFA) identity and access management (IAM) identity governance and administration (IGA) and privileged access management (PAM) systems all integrating zero-trust architectures into their core technologies.Meanwhile, technology research firms Gartner and Forrester have both launched full coverage of the space. Gartner refers to the discipline as Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment, or CARTA; and Forrester calls it the Zero Trust Extended, or ZTX, ecosystem. In another sign that zero trust is moving into the mainstream, Cisco recently acquired Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Duo Security, a fast-growing supplier of cloud-based multi-factor authentication systems, for $2.3 billion. That move has been widely seen as an effort to add zero-trust horsepower to its expanding portfolio of security services.However, implementing zero-trust is not without its challenges.

They’ve developed an innovative way to make it significantly more difficult to detect websites they’ve poisoned, and much more cumbersome to clean up, says Huang.They’ve done this by concocting a clever new method for imbedding scripts in the poisoned sites. These javascripts redirect the visitor’s PC to servers dishing up additional malicious programs. The breakthrough has to do with the fact that the redirection javascript come from other legit websites previously infected and controlled by the bad guys. Armorize is calling this innovation a “mass-meshing attack”So far, Amorize has released a sample list of 700 websites thusly corrupted by the attackers, of which only 20% have been detected and blacklisted by Google based on this particular attack. Using a conservative extrapolation methodology, Amorize estimates that 20,000 to 30,000 such sites may currently be infected by this group, with more being added every hour.“We’re not seeing any of the Alexa Top 500 sites. I don’t see very many extremely high traffic web sites. But the infected sites do have traffic. From what we’ve seen these are mostly mid-sized websites,” says Huang.Examples of corrupted websites include: easywayshoping.com

These developments would have, over the next decade or so, steadily and materially reduced society’s general exposure to cybercrime and online privacy abuses.Then COVID-19 came along and obliterated societal norms and standard business practices. A sweeping overhaul of the status quo – foreshadowed by the sudden and acute shift to a predominantly work-from-home workforce – lies ahead.One thing is certain, as this global reset plays out, cyber criminals will seize upon fresh opportunities to breach company and home networks, and to steal, defraud and disrupt, which they’ve already commenced doing.Yet there are a few threads of a silver lining I’d like to point out. It is possible, if not probable, that we are about to witness an accelerated rate of adoption of cyber hygiene best practices, as well as more intensive use of leading-edge security tools and services. And this positive upswing could be reinforced by stricter adherence to, not just the letter, but the spirit of data security laws already on the books in several nations.There is an urgency in the air to do the right thing. Several key variables happen to be tilting in an advantageous direction.

To understand what a lucrative endeavor this has become requires a basic grasp of how “contextual” advertising — ads that chase certain keywords — appear alongside search results and on blogs and web pages.Contextual advertising 101Advertisers pay for each click to those “sponsored” ads that appear alongside Google search results. (Microsoft Bing and YahooSearch use similar systems to generate ad revenues.) The advertisers bid for placement next to “keywords” that relate to their product or service. This same “keyword” bidding process delivers those Google adSense ads that appear on hundreds of thousands of blogs and websites.It’s this latter arrangement that cyber gangs are intensively targeting.U.S. companies paid a record $14.2 billion for paid keyword-driven contextual ads in 2009, with Google commanding 55% of that revenue, Yahoo 9% and Microsoft 6%, says tech research firm IDC.Meanwhile, click fraud rates rose to 17.4 % to 29.4% in the first three months of this year, according to separate estimates by Click Forensics and Anchor Intelligence, respectively. That’s up from 15.4% to 25.7% in the final three months of 2009, according to the two leading suppliers of click fraud detection and filtering technology.

It simply asks the advertisers on every site you visit not to track you, says Jonathan Mayer, a Stanford University computer science graduate student, whose research the FTC reviewed in making its proposal. “Our aim was to make Do Not Track completely transparent to the user,” says Mayer. “They flip one switch, and all advertising networks and tracking services won’t track them.”The catch: The burgeoning industry of advertising networks and online tracking services that have devised dozens of sophisticated ways to identify and profile specific consumers must be compelled to obey consumers’ wishes.Testifying at a congressional hearing Thursday, David Vladeck, director of the FTC’s consumer protection bureau, suggested that online advertisers are not about to do that voluntarily. He testified that it would take “legislation or potentially … robust, enforceable self-regulation.”Unlike Do Not Call, Do Not Track doesn’t require maintenance of a registry of users. It simply instructs every online advertiser not to track you. The technology is so simple that users of the Firefox Web browser have been able to use a Do Not Track mechanism since July 2009.

But with mounting pressure to replace legacy, perimeter-centric defenses with cloud- and hybrid-cloud protection, many organizations are stuck between a rock and a hard place.It goes without saying that phasing out a legacy system and putting something modern in its place is a substantial undertaking. IT teams are stretched thin as they install the new system while supporting the old one.Simultaneously, end-users with years of expertise on the old system must suddenly learn a new one. Between potential downtime and retraining an entire organization on new workflows, processes, and user interface, productivity is at risk, and with it, the bottom line.Take identity management—arguably one of the most important defenses against cyber threats—for example. Companies make significant investments in identity governance and administration (IGA) or identity access management (IAM), only to realize that these siloed, on-premises systems can’t meet the needs of a modern, flexible, cloud-centric, and digital enterprise."

But Contu  anticipates the market will grow 13 % in 2010, with revenue topping  $16  billion by the close of next year.“Although the worldwide security software market is affected by the economic downturn, the growth will continue to be strong in 2009 as security remains a critical area where drastic cuts cannot be afforded,” said Ruggero Contu, principal research analyst at Gartner.Growth will come from software-as-a-service, or SaaS. This includes the   predictive, cloud-based technologies introduced this year: McAfee Artemis, Panda Cloud, Trend Micro Smart Protection and Symantec Quorum.And small- and medium- businesses are expected to  go on a shopping spree for cyber protection as SMBs “are in security catch-up mode compared with large companies and therefore spend a higher percentage of their budgets on security,” says Contu.In 2009, consumer security will as usual account for the most revenue, $3.6 billion or 25 per cent of the total market, or 4 % more than 2008.Corporate IT buyers will spend $10.9 billion this year — 9% more than 2008 — on  endpoint protection platform, email security, user provisioning, among other security systems.,Major acquistions in 2008 included  McAfee purchasing Secure Computing, Symantec acquiring MessageLabs and Sophos nabbing Ultimaco.

But sometimes mere naivety or even ignorance are enough to wreak havoc. So-called ‘social engineering’ or phishing attacks cause millions in breaches or damages every year to US businesses, and they are increasing in frequency.One of the main reasons why this problem is so large is because companies rarely prevent employee access to webmail, social networking sites, or just about anything for that matter, that could prevent an employee from stealing company information, accidentally leaking it, or infecting the network.Businesses rarely stop workers from having Internet freedom because, frankly, it upsets workers, especially younger ones. I’ve even encountered organizations saying it’s easier for them to just pay a fine when a breach occurs than to prevent their employees from logging into other online accounts.Today, all it takes to breach a system is one trigger-happy employee who was curious about a personal email from a dying Nigerian woman offering a diamond-encrusted estate if they would “clik heer.”If IT security defensive measures cannot evolve at a rate which can prevent social engineering breaches either allowed or caused by employees, we will end up losing.It’s not just our national secrets that we have to worry about being exposed, it’s everything we say and send through those magical pipes of the … more"

The Aug. 20, 2008 tragedy killed 154 of 172 souls on board the Boeing MD-80 jetliner.El Pais cites a 12,000-page investigative report that outlines how a computer infection, spread via an infected USB thumb drive, may have been a contributing factor.

They are doing this by stepping up the use of cutting-edge tech security systems.And by moving to advance public knowledge about the stealthy tactics of cyberintruders, companies under attack could be taking a crucial step toward gaining an advantage on the attackers, say security analysts and law enforcement officials.“The one thing these disclosures have done is provide significant visibility into the latest attacks,” says Lawrence Pingree, cybersecurity industry analyst at market researcher Gartner. “Without that, you’re blind.”Data thieves, cyberspies and hacktivists, to be sure, continue to probe company networks as intensively as ever.

But it is now offering three new programs to encourage and compensate so-called gray hat and white hat researchers who spend their days hunting down fresh security flaws in Microsoft products.Hackers can now claim bounties of up to $100,000, depending on the type of bug discovered. For instance, Microsoft will pay $11,000 hard cash for any bugs found in its upcoming Internet Explorer 11 browser software.“Microsoft entering the game is a big changer because they are a large traditional software vendor,” says Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer at application security vendor Veracode. “People are waiting to see if Oracle, Cisco, or SAP follow suit.”Microsoft has come full circle in the hacking community’s fractious “full disclosure” debate. Black hat, white hat and gray hat hackers have been relentlessly exposing new Windows bugs since the 1990s.White hats argue that the intense scrutiny compels software vendors, like Microsoft, to take security more seriously and patch security flaws with more alacrity. Black hats hunt for bugs, too, but with criminal intent. Gray hats sometimes contribute to the cause of good, and at other times behave more like black hats.Each newly disclosed Windows bug sets off a race to get the new vulnerability patched across the massive breadth of WIndows PCs, laptops and servers — before the bad guys can take advantage. That phenomenon now happens at such a frenzied scale that Microsoft has taken to issuing security patches on the first Tuesday of each month to maintain a semblance of order.Bug bounty programs came along in 2004 as a way encourage gray hats and white … more"

One big question raised byÂ  the proposed AT&T – T-Mobile merger is whether theÂ  large scale consolidation of two top mobile service providers will result in better security and privacy, especiallyÂ  in our fast-changing world of Internet-connected devices accessing cloud service.The Justice Department filed this lawsuit Wednesday, 31Aug2011, to block AT&T’s planned acquisition of T-Mobile, bringing into high relief the debate over whether corporations or consumers matter more as the U.S. struggles through an economic downturn.AT&T has said that the proposed $39 billion merger between the nation’s No.2 and No.4 mobile service providers is crucial to improving mobile services nationwide.AT&T general counsel Wayne Watts said the carrier was “surprised and disappointed,” and would seek a hearing so the “enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed.”Consumer groups and some politicians worry about having just two dominant mobile players, AT&T and Verizon, with Sprint Nextel a distant third. If consummated, the deal “would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower-quality products for their mobile wireless services,” says U.S. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole.Federal Communications Commission chief Julius Genachowski says though the FCC hasn’t completed its review of the deal, the records it has seen also raise “serious concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on competition.”AT&T maintains that absorbing T-Mobile would result in expansion of the best available mobile broadband technology to 55 million people, or 97% of the U.S. market. It has the backing of The Association for Competitive Technology, which represents 3,000 small- and midsize technology firms. “This is a profoundly misguided decision,” Morgan Reed, ACT’s executive director, says of the lawsuit.AT&T made similar promises of improved services and pricing when it moved to acquire Cingular in 2004, “only to betray those promises” after securing federal approval, says Harvey Rosenfield, founder of … more"

And the antics of the LulzSec hacktivist group has resulted in successful Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attacks and data thefts committed against Â numerous companies.In this LastWatchdog guest post, Lori MacVittie, senior technical marketing manager at F5 Networks, describes what operatives who execute successful DDos attacks are doing to hide their tracks.By Lori MacVittieIn recent years there has been a noticeable increase in the number of attacks motivated for reasons other than monetary gain. The infamous Anonymous group, responsible for a spate of attacks against organizations and government agencies involved in the Wikileaks incident,Â hasÂ continued to attack sites and organizations as a political statement in what some call â€œhacktivism.â€Itâ€™s become a form of digital protest; an attempt to overwhelm not the physical presence of an organization with bodies and picket signs but instead the digital presence with bits and bytes.In the past, such attempts required significant resources. Overwhelming even a mid-sized organizationâ€™s web presence required thousands of launch points.Today, overwhelming a website with volumes of traffic is still attempted, but itâ€™s rarely as successful as it once was.

Compared to virtual machines (VMs), containers are much smaller, start up much faster, and have better performance.Related article: Why companies need fresh security solutions as mobile device usage ramps upFast forward to 2017, and software containers are becoming the platform of choice to build cloud architecture due to their significant benefits: speed of development, speed of deployment, flexibility, scalability and the cost-effective use of computer resources. However, they also introduce new risks. They run on a shared kernel (meaning they share an operating system and device drivers with their host—usually a VM), introduce challenges with isolating users and processes, add a layer that obscures visibility into activity on the host, and managing the sheer scale of container deployments is daunting.Stumbling blocksWhile many development teams invest some effort in using security best practices, their main objective is delivering code. At the end of the day, it’s the security group’s job to identify and manage application security risk, but most security professionals have no idea what containers are, let alone the security implications of deploying them. In addition, the brief history of cybersecurity has shown that whenever new technology is introduced, exploits that abuse it are never far behind.Despite those challenges, containers offer a rare window of opportunity to improve enterprise security in a game-changing way. Part of the reason is timing: Containers became enterprise-ready right as a confluence of factors—DevOps, Agile Development, the maturity of cloud-based architectures and growing interest in using microservices to build complex applications—are redefining how companies approach application development. These trends are introducing unprecedented collaboration, automation and agility into application development, and containers enable them all to manifest in a very noticeable way.Business leaders, IT catching onMany security professionals see containers as an opportunity to “bake” security into … more"

That’s because most free Wi-Fi hook ups are unencrypted.Sidejacking has been around since at least 2007. It’s considered an obscure attack vector. However, no one we know of has yet done a comprehensive study to measure how often sidejacking actually takes placeFiresheep was unveiled on Oct. 25 by Eric Butler, a Seattle-based Web application software developer and researcher. Good guy researchers like Butler are referred to as white hats. White hats try to beat black hats — bad guy hackers — to the punch finding fresh security flaws. White hats release their findings to start public discussions. Their goal is to prompt quick fixes and thus do their small part to improve overall security.Sometimes the new flaw exposed by the white hat creates widespread hacking opportunities. That’s when black hat hackers race to take advantage before fixes get made. That’s precisely the concern with Firesheep. An intruder sitting nearby can use Firesheep to silently take over your Facebook session, gain access to all of your sensitive data, and send viral messages and wall posts to all of your friends.On Monday, security firm Zscaler posted detailed instructions for detecting Firesheep and released a plug-in called BlackSheep designed to warn you if someone is using Firesheep in close proximity.

Behavior-aware advertising relies on a multi-layered web of players — ranging from the media and tech giants to thousands of third-party app developers and smaller ad networks. And it turns out that this Internet-enabled collaborative effort to match your web surfing habits to things you might buy is wide open to the spreading of malicious coding.Backgrounder: Profile of the Syrian Electronic Army“From a hackers perspective, this represents a soft attack vector for compromising high value and prestige web sites – and we can expect them to be targeted with increased vigor over the next few years,” says Gunter Ollmann, chief technology officer at IOActive.There are some 20 Chinese hacking collectives already taking advantage while striving to remain stealthy as they pilfer intellectual property from Western corporations.“We see the Chinese doing this all the time,” says Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at security start-up CrowdStrike. “When you can’t get into the target, you focus on a partner or customer and leverage that trust relationship.”The SEA is more like the Islamic hacking group — Cyber Fighters of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam — responsible for bedeviling U.S. banks.

Claiming to be exacting retribution for a slight against the prophet Muhammad, the Cyber Fighters orchestrated denial-of-service attacks that knocked down major banking websites for days at a time.Today, a hacktivist group, known as Anon Saudi, continues to regularly conduct smaller-scale denial-of-service attacks, targeting financial services companies for a variety of ideological reasons. In one recent instance, a large British bank that does business globally, learned that it had turned up on a list of banking sites targeted for an Anon Saudi DDoS campaign. Forewarned, the bank was then able to repel the attack.Attack vector: Anon Saudi used Twitter to foment ideological ire against the financial companies on the target list. Once a certain level of unrest was achieved, the group issued a link to a website with details of when and how volunteers should use their personal computing devices to bombard the targeted websites with nuisance requests.Distinctive technique: This was to be a “slow HTTP attack.” Each volunteer was instructed to initiate nuisance requests to the targeted webpages in such a way as to keep the page open for a long period of time, delaying or cutting off requests from legitimate customers.Wider implications: The financial services sector has spent billions since the Izz ad-Din onslaught in 2012-13 to shore up defenses.
